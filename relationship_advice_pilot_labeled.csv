I've been with her for nearly 13 years now and we have 2 kids together.  She is 100% the most attractive woman I have ever been with, and I don't care whatsoever about those small things.  I know she does though, so I try to not ignore her when she speaks about them.  It's not that I don't notice the things she points out, but they pale in comparison to everything else about her that is absolutely insanely attractive to me.

I never agree with her when she starts beating herself up over her body, but it's impossible for me to correctly articulate how I feel about her physical appearance in words at that moment.  I can't say ""yes, I see the thing you are complaining about, but it has no impact at all to how hot you are"" without it sounding disingenuous, because I don't ever want her to think that these things matter in the slightest.

When I was younger, I'd opt for the route that I'd guess your husband appears to be taking here; pretend it doesn't even exist.  It always seems like a good option at the time, but it has the possibility of backfiring (as it appears to have done here) because it comes across as not paying attention or not acknowledging your partner.

I'd venture to guess he probably has a hard time articulating his feelings.  Taking it even further (and my apologies if my assumption here is incorrect), judging by your willingness to talk so openly about your stretch marks, I'd guess you're probably a pretty strong woman that's not afraid to tell your husband what you're thinking.  This may make it hard for him to want to talk about it with you.  Especially since he loves you and knows intimacy is a sore subject.

I'd sit him down and tell him how you are feeling, let him know how the lack of intimacy is bothering you and you want to know why things seem to have changed.  Try not to frame it as a ""him"" problem or an attack.  Approach him as a caring spouse that noted a change in behavior, and you want to get to the bottom of it to make sure he's OK and help find a solution."

This is the conundrum of young love.  On the one hand,  you're happy and not necessarily looking for a reason to break up.  But on the other hand, you're only young once.   

The thing here is, long term relationships in your age group have a success rate approaching zero.  Not because of anything against you two, but because you're young and you're going to change A LOT over the next several years.  18-25 is a pretty big deal, and hell,  18-30 is gigantic.

He also still talked to this ex, not really flirty or that 'i want you back' shit. That was pretty much impossible since she lives across the Atlantic ocean... 

At that time I was very very insecure and that made me jealous. So jealous that I couldn't even let him look at boobs that pop up in movies... 

That jealousy and being nosey in everything, made him break up with me. We did come back to each other after like 5 months. During the time we were broken up, he went back to his country to see his family. Guess what happened... he goddamn kissed that stupid ex! I can't blame him since we were broken up but it did confirm that she was still going after him and was a huge rock between me and my bf. 

The day he came back, he messaged me asking if I could come over. I did and since then we haven't been separated since. Oh and haven't heard anything about that ex anymore. He isn't interested in her in any way. We're now (after the break up) 8 years together with a beautiful daughter!

All I can ask is: is he still contacting her? Is she still in the picture somehow? If so, I would have a serious talk about what you expect from him so that you can lose the anger. I think your anger is more having difficulty trusting him and that is completely reasonable!

Like I think it's fair for her to say you're not as attractive to her anymore but because she loves you she's willing to overlook sex. You obviously shouldn't be only into looks, but it's unfair to expect someone to just look past it entirely.

That said it is weird that such a sentiment wasn't shared sooner, it feels like you lack communication. That kind of thing should have been brought up six months ago when she noticed the lower attraction. Also strange that her first impulse is to say ""it's okay we just won't have sex"" instead of ""if you lose some weight I would probably be more attracted to you again"", though maybe she didn't want to hurt your feelings.

If I was in your place, I would probably start working out and do whatever I can to stop stress eating as much as possible, but also like, have a serious discussion with her. If she does think you losing weight would help then that's probably a good sign, if she thinks it won't change anything then the people saying she's using you might be more right than I thought. You could also ask her to help you with it if she approves that.

I dunno I never want to assume the worst in these situations but it's obviously a possibility. She is dependent on you which doesn't help to make sure she's 100% honest, but people saying that because of that she's obviously using you, that I'm not sure I agree with.

Edit: also some people are out there leaving comments like ""she wants the benefits without the cost"" and it really feels like a toxic mentality, like giving him sexual gratification is her job and she must do it whether she wants it or not.

There is her irresponsibility with money and the other issue is how to divide control of finances.  The division of control has many choices but consider her contribution to your household besides finances.  If she becomes a stay at home mom should she get 0 say with the budget?  That's not fair either.

For deciding on budgeting control,  You might want to allot a certain amount of monthly money to both of you that's the same, like 4k for her and 4k for you to spend on whatever you want.  The rest goes into an account to decide by both of you.  If you two can't agree on big purchases and the shared account reaches a threshold(e.g. 100k) then 50k of that goes into an investment account recommended by your financial planner so at least it's being used wisely and will result in more money down the road.
This is just an example.  Even though you two may not have the same attitudes on budgeting it does require you two to be mature adults who can compromise.  If that's not true then it should have been dealt with before marriage or counseling right now.

For the more difficult issue of what you perceive as her financial irresponsibility it will require you two align your future goals more.  If you are planning to achieve wealth that will last for generations and are thinking long term, but she is focused on enjoying her wealth now, that is a very big misalignment and will also require maturity and compromise from both of you."

I'll say this though, I'd wait to see if the demand was a knee jerk reaction. If she holds to that, that's probably a relationship killer imo. If she doesn't and she cools off, I could see the relationship continuing for sure but with two extremely necessary talks happening first. 

First, there has to be a talk about privacy. That's extremely concerning that she is snooping like that. There obviously shouldn't be secrets in relationships, but at the same time, what if you need to hide a gift for them? It's also less about secret keeping and more about trust. In a long term relationship both partners have to be able to trust each other. Her snooping says she doesn't trust you. Even if you trust her and love her to death, you can't keep a relationship going if she doesn't trust you (whether justified or not). 

Second, there needs to be a talk about ""demands and threats."" I don't think much more needs to be explained there. It should be very clear that those aren't healthy relationship actions. 

Good luck with whatever you decide in the end, and keep in mind, almost anything can be worked out if both parties want to work it out in earnest. In order to do so however, they must actually be worked out instead of swept under the rug. "

I haven't seen this mentioned, so I'll leave this here; the leap in maturity from 19 to 22 is large. This is your first relationship, and I can relate. My first relationship was when I was 17 with a 21 year old. He would play games for HOURS, without notice to me. It only worked for so long because I am also a gamer, and would entertain myself. However, with him being so much more of an adult than me, he needed to be the adultier adult and communicate better. He didn't. By the time I broke up with him (21/25), I was sick of how infantile he was in the relationship. No communication, no regard for my needs, and if I communicated properly, he acted like a child. I don't think your bf is acting as mine did, but please just be aware of the differences. He should be a bit more involved and aware, and if he can't be, needs to work on his communication.

ALSO. I would recommend you just kinda settle in for a while. Both my ex and my husband are SoulsBourneSekiro fans, and I'm fully expecting my husband to shut down and out once he gets Elden Ring LOL. I knew exactly what game he was playing when you started your post!! 

Quick aside; forgot to add this above. If you have any hobbies or crafts you could do while he plays, do it. My husband will get lost in games for hours, and sometimes he doesn't want to directly engage with me, but wants me around. Ask your bf if this is the case, and let him know you don't mind if that's the case, but you still need to be checked in on periodically and need affection.

It sounds like he doesn't respect where you are at in your career decision making position. 

Were you with each other when he was where you are at? It's possible he didn't have what you're going through mentally if he went into the job market strong. I know I didn't enter strong and as a 30 year old man now, I definitely beat myself up for 4 years after graduating college and figuring out what I wanted to do. It sounds like he doesn't understand where you mentally are right now and isn't able to show empathy for it. If he's attacking you as a person rather than critiquing your formative decisions about your career, that's inexcusable imo. Even if he was criticizing your decisions, he should be offering tips either on how he decided his plans or help your planning process. For examples, write down your strength and weaknesses, what you enjoy to do, how you enjoy doing things in general, etc. Then compare them to job descriptions and see what sounds enjoyable.


 He might have also become comfortable to his position as the bread winner of the relationship (for now) and is on a bit of a power trip in terms of his ability to financially control things. I'd think about talking to a relationship therapist if what I'm saying is close to what you think is going on after reading this. 

I'm only 6 months into my current relationship and earn a little more than my girlfriend but it doesn't effect how we talk, argue, or think about each other. We already understand that we're serious and it's not about ""me"" it's already about ""us"". It's our income, our earnings, our happiness, etc. 

The rest is all theory so please ignore if I'm off: It's scary to think about but I would be as confident about your life and goals as he is about his position. I am picturing too many apologies being thrown his direction. Too much nervous body language that he could be seeing and taking advantage of. Put your arms on your hips, stand up straight more, and say you believe in yourself and that even though he earns more than you, you deserve respect anyways. Especially since you're his significant other. Personally, I respect the shit out of my girlfriend and consider her stronger than me but that we're a team and help each other when and where we need it.

The ""lets see what happens"" is the most level headed thing he could say.  Neither of you knows who the other person is in this short a time.  Too things are going on for both of you:  1.

It seems like he discovered something that didn't line up with his fantasy picture of you and is slowing things down.  This is very, very healthy.  New relationship energy wears off.  This is why so many relationships and marriages end in 2-3 years.  After NRE wears off you start seeing who the other person really is and all the ways in which you are not compatible for a long relationship.

She's a manipulator, and I can tell just at a glance because I have an ex who played the same crap on me off and on for four years before I cottoned on and cut her out of my life permanently.

People like Maria are *always* the victim, and anyone who causes them mild discomfort or point out their true shitty self are *always* the abusers. In this scenario, Pat has been with her for so long, he's too entrenched to realize she's a terrible person, but she still has her claws in him so he isn't such a bad guy... *Yet*.

I think I'd be behind on that too if my partner of several decades was acting shady and turned out to be cheating on me as well. The person being cheated on can always tell, even if only subconsciously, and this is a very common blaming tactic cheaters use to give reasons for why they cheated. So, small smear campaign definitely in progress here.

If Maria was remorseful, truly, she'd realize she's disrupting her husband's family, she'd realize that she's causing OP's household strain, and she'd figure out some way to solve that.

The commenter interprets the boyfriend's behavior as unambiguous red flags and presents their assessment as factual rather than as one possible interpretation among others.,"[""red flag"", ""I would maybe not entertain this much further"", ""This is also a red flag"", ""I would stay the hell away from this one"", ""Because"", ""That means""]","Ok...here’s my take.  

1.  Every time he says he wants a relationship, you should be equating that to a statement saying, “I want you to have sex exclusively with me”.   Because he keeps bringing that up and not respecting that you want to ease into things, that’s a red flag and I would maybe not entertain this much further. 

2.   Following up on that, the exclusive sex thing is the reason why he wants to know if you have guy friends.  He’s assuming that all men think about women the way he thinks about them.  That means any male friend of yours is also trying to have sex with you, which makes them a threat.  This is also a red flag and a sign that if this continues, you won’t be allowed to have male friends anymore.  He will probably also be super controlling of that, so be prepared to handle his paranoia with respect to that.  

3.   He doesn’t seem to view you as a peer, as someone to be respected.   If he did, he wouldn’t pressure you about how much time you’re going to need.  To him, because this is about sex, he doesn’t really need you to take time.  He doesn’t need to learn about you.  He just wants to have sex and to exercise control over you to ensure you only have sex with him.  

I would stay the hell away from this one."

Quit it because I hated it so much, but now work in a small office behind closed doors with 5 other people and talk on the phone all day for a car dealership. Not saying what I do is the end all and be all because his can be totally different than mine. But the weed isn’t helping him since he obviously hasn’t learned how to cope with the anxiety. And neither is his therapist he should probably invest in another one (and that’s ok I went through 3 before I found mine).

Honestly, I really hate saying this and really hope I’m wrong, but it sounds like he is using his anxiety and weed as a crutch to do nothing. Which if that’s the case be honest. I don’t like working either. But it’s not fair to you, and there’s so many things he can do alone that bring in extra cash and help. Hell he can be a door dash driver or Instacart driver.

DON'T PLAY THE GREY AREA/HYPOTHETICAL GAME, WITH PHYSICAL VIOLENCE.  You draw clear lines, remove the joking and at least 1 time, say to his face.  ""If you ever lay your hands on me and slap me, our relationship is over.""

Just make sure he acknowledges that it was said. 

I don't even think he actually is going to slap you around or anything, I think this was a dumbass conversation for a couple young humans in love just had while goofing around, but regardless, do not fuck around with boundaries.

If ALL of your boudaries are not vocalized to the other partner, with the consequence of the relationship being over if the lines are crossed, then you are dumb.

Also just for clarity sake as you are a young person getting into the whole adult relationship world.

Any boundarie or dealbreaker that does not have the implicit result in an immediate ending of the relationship, is a bullshit lie.  A fake boundary and a cowards bluff.  Never move a single inch on your dealbreakers.

Just communicate and judge his reaction and make it clear this isn't a grey zone, or a ""thought experiment"" its you telling him that if you ever were to get slapped it would be the last time you are touched by the person who slapped you."

Well obviously if you had a bad breakup and didn't have some kind of agreement outside of a verbal contract he could potentially kick you out without notice and potentially lay claim to furniture and such bought together. I'm not sure exactly of the laws and I'm sure it depends on where you are and such but that would be difficult on top of going through a breakup. 

But as far as while you're together I wouldn't see it as anything specific per se, but it will likely subconsciously weigh in on decisions you may make such as personalizations to the house, furniture, etc. Again, maybe I'm just being extra cautious as someone who has been manipulated in the past, but I feel like it can go from 'this person is not in any way manipulative and I know I can trust them' to 'this person owns/controls everything in my life' without even realizing it's happening. And for me at least, it started with reasonable-sounding decisions like this one. He may very well be a great person, but living together in a setting where you have equal legal control of the situation first could be helpful in knowing that for sure.

Even if you can't fully predict how it will weigh on things in the future, getting a solid foundation of a relationship before integrating things and adding power dynamics like that can be a safer bet I suppose. But we're also not the same people and I'm not saying that's necessarily what's best for you, either. I'm fully aware I'm projecting my own past onto this so it could be completely fine for your situation, but I thought it's still potentially helpful to weigh in with my experiences at least.

There is nothing wrong with wanting to remain friends now that you know. But I think it's important to ask yourself some questions about your relationship with her:


If she was cis, would you want her to be your girlfriend?
Now that you know she's trans, how does that change her as a person?
What is it that's turning you off?
Why is that turning you off?

To a certain extent I think he is right. Life is not always exciting. When you are together for a number of years life will settle down and get tedious/routine-ish. This is normal. However, he is taking it to an unhealthy level in being that all he wants to do is be a couch potato lol

There are things couples can do to bring back some excitement, but this requires effort on both parties. It seems like he is perfectly fine being a couch potato. 

Now, having said that, what about going out and exploring some things by yourself? I am not saying break up, or take a break. I am talking about self fulfillment. If he won't do things with you, make it a point to go do them alone. Get that excitement you need and see if that helps. Before you protest, yes I am aware that it would be great if you guys did such things together, but since right now he seems adamant on a boring life, I say try it alone. 

The reason I am giving this advise is because its clear you love him and want to work it out. Perhaps if he sees that you are having such a great time alone, and living life to its fullest, he might eventually want to be a part of that. 

As time goes by if he doesn't come around, you can at that point decide if you wish to stay or go. But at least you tried to live your life and make it exciting. I want to add that there is nothing wrong with doing things on your own, its actually vital to have a life outside of your relationship. "

We are not discussing sex preference here. We are discussing boundary made because of a trauma. She made it clear from the start she would never perform it. Him bringing it up like this triggered her, which explains her response. People are free to break up for any reason and if she is scared for her mental health and well being she is free to break up with him. 
If receiving bj is more important to him than his gf wellbeing then they are not compatible anymore. It is not a big deal, people broke up eventually. That's tough but they will get over it with times.

She’s had an emotional affair, which is bad. Only you know whether you can get over that. 

She feels emotionally abused by you. You would have to really work on that if you want to stay together because she feels how she feels. (And if you ask me, that packing your suitcase so she’d beg you to stay bit was super manipulative and immature)

You should absolutely work out your feelings in therapy. But you’re only half of this decision. If you were to decide you could get over the emotional affair and work on changing yourself, she would still have to want to be with you. It’s not solely your decision.
