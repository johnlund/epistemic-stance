I just wish you would take time and read this completely because I feel it's going to be a little long. Firstly, I am sorry for what you are going through and I hope you will find what you are looking for. **Disclaimer: these are just my thoughts, you don't have to accept it, you can just unlike it or delete it even, I dont mind.** And also I am younger than you and I feel like I have my shares of loneliness (no friends I could share my deepest secrets, just friends in names, there are nobody I have nearby that I could share my interests with, I don't hang out with anyone in my own class and I might be like a shadow lol) and I am not saying that I know exactly what you are going through because that doesn't bring justice to what you are going through as I don't know if it is the same as me.

First of all I am not going to give you false hopes saying that it is going to work out if you think that people love you and stuff. But that is a part of it. Just have positive thoughts. And you know how you could be positive? Here's what I figured would kick-start us to be positive. I started to find things that made me curious and exciting, and I work on that. I was lucky to have found out my interest at a young age (I am still young by the way :P lol) and I am intending to take it as my career. I realized this recently as I was really depressed for maybe two months and this week I found something that is in my interest and I started working on it by creating a small goal. I was happy to be able to be consistent with it and working on it. I get excited when I see that I am progressing little by little. Also, I enjoy the working part more than seeing my goal accomplished. But I also know that if I drop this goal at some point, depression will be back in the house. That's why I am trying very careful not to be burnout and try to complete it, so I get an accomplished feeling and use that for the next thing I might be doing. 

I believe that there are many things that as an individual we are interested in it and I don't think that there is a magical destiny for each of us or magical talent that we need to discover inside us blah blah blah. So just give a thought in what you are interested in and try to work in it. It doesn't matter, it can be anything. Painting, dancing, music, instrument, programming, tinkering with gadgets, designing, martial arts etc. etc. And you know what, maybe you might find people who share the same interests as you, and you might hit it really well. Try being curious like a kid and explore - that's what I will say.

Also, another thing I will give a lot of credit to in my life was when I started to meditate. Well it's not when I started, it was maybe a long time after I started, like three months after I started. That's when the effects of my daily-two-times-15minutes-meditation started to kick in. At the beginning I was like ""what is this, will it ever work?"", well I was really convinced when I started to experience the true results. It will take time for some to see the effect of meditation. For some it will be really quick. Fact is, it doesn't matter what the result is, just do it for the sake of doing it. 

Enjoy the path to your destination rather than waiting for the goal to complete to celebrate. Celebrate every day. Who cares if someone ignores me. I like it when I work on the stuff I like 🥳 yay. This is my current state. Me, who was just one week ago, was trying to think I might be alone for my whole life started to think that maybe I will see someone who have same interests as me. **Again, I am not saying that you should accept this as it is, you can just close this comment and move on with something else if you want and just forget what I said, it is completely up to you.** Everyday something good might happen, something bad might happen. It might be the best day some days. It might be the worst day some days that you feel like why go on more. But who cares if it is a bad day, **let it go**, it doesn't matter in the end.

I just said my experiences and my opinions and the way I tried to tackle my loneliness. I might not have tackled my loneliness, but oh well I got at least my parents who do take care of me, and now I am realizing that there were people who have actually cared about me at some point. I don't think I have to try to tackle my loneliness, I think I have to change my attention to something else.
