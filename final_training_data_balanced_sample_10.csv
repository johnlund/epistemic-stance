When you are nervous/anxious/overthinking/worrying you are annoying, your verbal and nonverbal actions tend to show it. If you keep acting this way, people will stop associating with you because it’s a negative vibe. You are essentially conveying that you are indeed unworthy to hold a conversation with them or be around them and that they need to be constantly reassuring you. That’s not what you want to convey, and it’s nobody else’s job but your own to validate and reassure yourself. People gravitate towards self confidence, not anxiety.

Try this. Genuinely connect with people in real life e.g. ask how they are, their hobbies, interests, goals, opinions, etc. Listen and pay attention to what people say. Share those things about yourself when asked. People also subconsciously attach you to the value you bring. The value you bring is a clear, unique, and convincing reason why people will interact with you, let alone do so constantly. So Find ways to add value to their lives. Having In person interactions is the easiest way to stand out from countless people who text or message. People remember and favor in person interactions because of the positive vibes. If your hobbies, skills, talents align with their interests or can help them, bring it up and offer to help them. Finally, learn how to be genuinely busy in your life pursuing your goals and hobbies, while interacting with people on the side. People are hardwired to be repulsed by neediness and desperation and instead gravitate towards those who are self confident and well rounded in life.

soc_289475,"This is a great write up. Your self-awareness is fantastic and an incredibly helpful trait to have.

Your location does make it harder, but not impossible, to meet the right people. You need to hang around people that you want to be like and that you truly enjoy being around. Feel free to cut the rest. The best way to quit smoking is to stop hanging out with smokers. The same can be said about all qualities and habits. If you want to be smarter, happier, nicer, or more creative, hang out with smarter, happier, nicer or more creative people.

You need to go to where those people are, and spend as much time as possible interacting with them. Unfortunately, you can be judged for you place of living, so try to not bring people there. You can tell people where you live but I would add that you are working to get out of there at some point.

With single guys, the best thing you can do is show disinterest in any form of touching except for the slightest amount of social touching. So if they put their hand on your back, scoot away. Don't be mean about it, but make it pretty obvious that you aren't comfortable with it. If you show them you aren't comfortable getting physically close, but you really enjoy their company and have fun with them, they should get the point. If they keep pursuing, you will probably have to tell them you like them, but are not interested in anything past a friendship (which may push them away if that's all they want, but you can't do much about it). Just try to be cool about it. You don't want to insult them otherwise that will be the reason they don't want to be friends anymore.

With guys with wives/girlfriends, same rules apply as above. Don't be physically flirty at all. Especially if his S/O is around. If she is, try to get to know her and don't look all interested in him. She shouldn't be given any reason to think that you would ever want to get with him. Still, it's hard for anyone to have their S/O become good friends and spend a lot of time with someone of the opposite sex.

As far as your relationships, unless you are doing something dramatic that I can't tell, it's probably just not the right person for you. Like the guy who came out of nowhere with his kids and whatnot, that's all just him. You didn't do anything. When you hang out with higher caliber people (not necessarily status but just better quality), you shouldn't run into problems like these.

There's a lot to finding, meeting and making new friends. PM if you want to talk more.",evaluativist,reddit_silver,1.0
soc_276061,"I think I know exactly what you're talking about. I was essentially this guy in highschool. With help and guidance you can grow out of it, but to do that you must understand it.

It could be that he simply feels like he is a character that he can't break out of now. It's pretty hard to start being nice and interacting in a healthy way when everyone already presumes you are going to be nasty towards them. Some people take this to extremes, for example the Japanese man who didn't talk to his wife for 28 years because he was scared to confront what he had made.

The second thing is that he probably has a very high opinion of himself and his views because he feels insecurity over his own self worth. When he fails to meet up with these expectations it only plummets his self-worth even further down. He eventually becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy by identifying with this pain, saying he just doesn't mix well, or that something is just inherently wrong with him, and may be too awkward or nervous to break the self made mold.

What he really needs is to find self-worth from within by casting out his pride. ""Pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source. True humility is the only antidote to shame."", as Iroh said. What else could help would be to help him be able to respect others opinions and values, and realize that not everyone may agree or even like him, but that does not determine his value as a human being. This may or may not roughly apply to him, but what really helped me was meditation for 20 minutes a day, and examining the thoughts, fears, and worries that popped up and where they come from.

I really hope this helps.",evaluativist,reddit_silver,1.0
soc_140573,"Be somebody's best friend wether they reciprocate or not. Call people up to hang out. Do selfless favours without any expectation of repayment. Compliment people when they achieve admirable things, support them if they need help to achieve them.

If they never reciprocate then so be it. That's not why you're being a good friend to them, you're doing it because you want to be a good friend to them. You shouldn't take it personally because you shouldn't ever take anything personally, if it's not self-criticism coming from yourself.

But really, create the environment you want to thrive in. Be the person you want others to be. You cannot control others, but you can control yourself. What you give dictates what people are willing to give to you. As an example: Shyness is terrible because closed people prompt other people to close themselves off. It's not out of malice, it's juts a natural defense mechanism to encountering someone who you feel is trying to hide themselves from you. People feel things all the time.

You've probably noticed that people you think are ""assholes"" tend to group together into a veritable Fart of Assholes (I made that grouping noun up). Why wouldn't you expect the same to apply to other sorts of people?

And being a ""nerd"" and not ""cool"" has nothing to do with this. These are meaningless labels as their definition wildly varies between people. If you're fixating on that as the source of your problems you're avoiding to look at the real source. Everyone does this, there's nothing shameful about it. It's just good to be aware of this completely human tendency.

soc_247538,"Its about 2 things.  Self-love and energy.

We tell ourselves not to ""bother"" anyone because we think so little about ourselves that we are convinced any interaction we have with someone will be a bother. We have to love ourselves to the fullest to be in a state that is eager and willing to give and receive love.  If we do not believe we are worthy of that love,  than we will not seek it.

Try affirmations when you wake up. ""I love myself. I love my life.  I am social. I am good looking.  I am worthy.  I am going to talk to someone new today.  I am going to make a new friend today.""

Once you start to grow as a person and have more confidence in your abilities and you are fully aware of how worthy you are to give and receive love you will have a whole new energy about you.  The goal is to bring as much happiness and beauty into the world as possible. If that is your goal then it isn't logical to believe you will bother someone by talking to them because you aren't a bother. You are a giver. 

Will you occasionally annoy someone or be told no by someone who has their own stuff going on?  Of course. That said,  their choice to not engage with you is their own personal choice and it has nothing to do with you. 

Will you find that most people are looking for the same things you are?  Of course. ",absolutist,reddit_silver,1.0

Usually it was because I saw a different side to them I didn’t like or I’d really needed them to be a friend and they weren’t there for me. I don’t think we should stay friends with everyone we get close to if it isn’t working for both sides.

soc_554790,"When you are out and about, during daytime or at night, and you see a woman you feel compelled to meet, do this:

1. Check in with yourself.

2. Speak your truth.

3. Leave.

Instead of walking down that imaginary long, lonely dead-end street of the cold approach, and then back out again, simply swerve by. 

Notice a woman you like, check in with yourself, walk by, make eye contact, smile, wink, speak your truth, and leave. Slide right on by…

1. Check in with yourself. 

Pause and check how you are feeling. Check in with your thoughts. What is it about this situation that compels you to meet her. 

Do you feel excited, nervous, confused? 

Do you think she is beautiful, cute, well-dressed, graceful?

Is something telling you to approach her? To not do it? 

2. Speak your truth.

Walk over (if necessary) and speak your truth. Women do not mind when you’re nervous, but they will punish you if you hesitate. If you feel compelled to meet this woman, then act swiftly. Just walk over and speak your truth. Blurt it. Share with her whatever you were feeling or thinking.

""I was with my friends, and I saw you and I had to come over and say ""you look cute.” 

“I saw you and I know I would feel bad about myself all day if I did not say hi to you. So here I am… hi”

""Hello, pretty girl... I love your red lipstick. You look absolutely radiant.""

“Something about you compelled me to come and say hi to you. I don’t know what it is but hi.”

“I am saying hi to all the beautiful women. Have a great day!”

Add more examples

It is important you speak your truth and nothing but your truth. No questions or requests. Just share with her whatever it is you are feeling or thinking in the moment.

3. Leave.

This is the most important. Do not wait for her reaction. Do not stick around. Do not hang around. Leave. Do not wait for it to become awkward. Do not wait for her response. Leave. That transaction is complete.

This is the hardest thing for guys to do, certainly when they think it goes well. We believe we have to create attraction by talking more, but we only risk messing up the attraction that may already be there.

To avoid that risk, leave before she reacts and before there is a chance of running out of things to say, before she can reject you, before you can look ridiculous, before it gets awkward and you mess up the attraction that is already there. The transaction is complete, and the attraction is there, or it’s not. There is nothing you can do to create attraction if it’s not already there. With every word, with every second you stay, you run a higher risk of messing up the attraction that may be there. Leave!

Why this works

&amp;#x200B;

When you swerve by, all you do is show up. To show up is all you must do, and all you can do to uncover the attraction that is possibly there and let it blossom. How does this happen?

1. You show up

You convey that you are not afraid to come over. Woody Allen said that 80% of success is showing up. You are now on the radar if you weren’t before. When you swerve by, you show up, and to show up is all you need to do to uncover the attraction that might be there.

When you simply show up you avoid letting the attraction go unexplored, uncovered, unnoticed.

2. Talk less

Always be communicating (the ABC of women), but talk a lot less... Even before you swerve by, a masterful seducer picks up signals. He picks up the signals of the girls that already like him. He picks up the attraction that is already there. To swerve by then only functions as showing you are not afraid to come over, or checking if you were right about her liking you, or allowing the attraction that was already there to blossom a little more. Or to see if there is any attraction when you did not get a chance yet to communicate from a distance.

Swerving by is a way to communicate with women in a language that is their own.

3. You give her a chance to love it or leave it.

Men think that attraction is theirs to create. They feel 100% responsible for the seduction at play.

But seduction is not a one-man dance performance. Seduction is a dance for two. And while it is a man's role to show up to the dance, invite her to dance and lead her to dance, it will never be a dance if she does not accept the invitation and contributes to the dance. He may hold up his arm and create space for her to twirl, but she is the one who decides if she’ll engage.

To swerve by gives her time and space. It gives her a chance to love it or leave it. It puts our attention on what could be happening for her, and it gives her a chance to contribute to the seduction at play. Her contribution is essential for any successful seduction.

Seduction is not a one-man show; it is a dance for two.

4. It is always better to come back than to stay

You know the feeling of when you return to loved ones? The feeling when you come back from a long trip and you meet again with your loved ones? You would never have had this feeling if you had not left in the first place.

Seduction thrives on the juxtaposition of intimacy and distance and swerving by honors that juxtaposition from the first moment you meet.

It is always better to come back than to stay.

&amp;#x200B;

How can a girl get back to you?

When I propose the Swerve By Method to guys, the main question I get is: how can seduction blossom when you leave?

In short, seduction blossoms because of it, not despite it.

More specifically,

1. If she likes you she will respond and try to make you stay. A woman who is attracted to you will want you to stay. When she wants you to stay, she will try to make you stay. Smile. Ask a question (""Where are you from?""), or protest you leaving (""Where are you going?""). Look out or these signs and act accordingly.

2. If she likes you she will find you. Certainly in bars, if a woman is attracted to you, she will come into your vicinity and wait for you to 'approach' her again. If the attraction is there, do not underestimate her creativity, conscious or unconscious, to make it as easy as possible for something to happen with you. In clubs or bars, places where you both will be around each other, I highly recommend the swerve by and leaving.

3. You can always come back. To come back is always better than to stay. When I say leave, I am not saying to run away. I say make space. I say be more prepared than here to leave that interaction. It is a very leading thing to do. To make space for her to love it or leave it. Make space for you to come back. And she will most likely welcome back a man who showed no need to stay in her space and was generous enough to give her the time and space to choose.

Include or delete? “In a more philosophical sense, when you swerve by and plant seeds wherever you go, Beauty springs up all around you. There is no need to chase it down. This is a secret of all men who have women in their life. They never chase. While other men are out there chasing girls, true lovers of women put their energy into the world to all around, an equal radiance for all. They let their presence be known. They smile and wink at all the girls. And women are drawn in “You are absolutely beautiful... why are we not together?” If she likes you, she will either stop you right then in your tracks with a question or a smile or... she will find you again. That’s the way it works. A simple appreciation of the beauty of women gathers far more phone numbers than any protracted cold approach. If she likes you, a phone number will materialize out of thin air, almost as an afterthought. No need to ask.”

soc_185291,"&gt; Sometimes I think they are because I do notice I get a lot of people looking at me or looking at me and smiling at me and trying to engage me in conversation. 

It's likely that they are flirting. Are they going out of their way to talk to you? Even if it's not strict flirting, we all prefer talking to people we find attractive.

&gt; My problem is, letting someone flirt with me or talk to me, causes my social anxiety/shyness to flare up, especially if I think they are attractive. Usually if it is someone I think is attractive, I don't make eye contact and I give abrupt answers because I am afraid of looking stupid or just want to get out of the situation. 

This is usual to a certain extent. Attractive people are intimidating. However, it looks like you're aware that you're signing ""I'm not interested"" and that you are a rather distinctive case.

&gt; Also, another issue is, I am terrible with body contact. So, even if I am sexually interested in a man and intend on hooking up with them, I don't give any signals until I jump them.  

Not everyone has to be super comfortable with physical contact. Have you tried to communicate the issue?

It's rather usual to ramp up physical touch over time to test the waters, of course. That's probably where you want to be.

To me, it looks like you are afraid of rejection. Do you crave/enjoy physical touch? It seems so, at least. That would mean that shyness is what stops you form acting the way you'd like to. 

My suggestion: Find out whether you suffer from an actual case of social anxiety that needs treatment (as a layman, my gut tells me 'no'). If not, shyness can be overcome by practice. Practice eye contact, then touching and so on.

&gt; Lately, I have become extremely blunt with men, especially through internet dating services and texting and it really has worked in my favor, although I am running into a problem where a lot of men that I am not interested are interested in me and start chasing me really, really hard. Then the men I am interested in are not interested in me. 

That seems to be the fate of an attractive woman. It is possible that the men that lose interest are not used to / do not appreciate your bluntness. A forward and sexually aggressive approach from a woman can give a man the impression that she wants casual sex rather than a relationship. 

I can imagine this. Maybe, due to rejecting physical contact save for clearly sexual purposes, you give off the impression that this is what you want. Either that or you just confuse the men that are not interested.

Either way, I'd suggest working on ramping up your forwardness. 

Hope that helps. ",evaluativist,reddit_silver,1.0
soc_180073,"&gt; Women are basically looking for someone who gives them attention, respect, and makes them feel special. We are not as superficial like most males are. We don't mind dating a guy who is not precisely the most attractive person there is, but we mind he is well groomed, well dressed (Not talking about expensive or brand clothes here) and with basic good manners. That's not difficult.

You pretty much described me depending on how you feel about beards I'm either well or not very well groomed. Actually come to think of it my last two dates where from my profile where I had a beard (my other is clean shaven).

Somehow it is hard for me. I don't understand it. On an old throwaway where I had a pic up a girl suggested look wise I'm very average and have nothing special. She also said I'd have better luck with a very specific profile after a specific type but that hasn't worked out either. There's too much competition for me to be noticed or maybe I'm pretty ugly.
