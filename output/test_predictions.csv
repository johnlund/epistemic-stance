Excitement is just anxiety but with proper breathing. 

I'll get back to that, but first here is something really important to consider:

You are completley normal. What would be abnormal is if you remained completely calm and unaffected by members of the opposite sex you're attracted to. 

Human are so hardwired for sex that we LITERALLY start to have chemical reactions when we're around someone we find attractive. Our hormone levels shoot up, dopamine and norepinephrine course through us and make us feel loopy, give us jitters, make our stomach do flips, and give us insomnia and loss of appetite. 

That is real. The only people who don't are probably just good at hiding it, or actually have something wrong with them.

So knowing that it's normal, just breathe through it. Whatever works for you, but personally when I have to maintain calm when I'm worked up I use a simple 4 count in / 4 count out breath (quiet, continuous, not ""deep breaths"" just normal breaths basically) and I can actually feel it working: the feeling of terror turns into the feeling of being a kid on Christmas morning in fewer than 10 breaths. 

This is physiology, nothing more. You're still going to feel all those butterflies and flushes and racing heart beat, but the fear will dissipate. And it can start to feel fun!

I've been married for 7 years now, but I still think back to how much I used to LOVE that feeling on a first date. You can actually learn to love and look forward to the exact feelings you're describing as being so uncomfortable now. It's a GOOD discomfort!

It even serves an important function of conveying attraction: people can pick up on this energy, this altered hormonal state, and it can actually be a positive signal. When I went on dates and I saw completely calm unaffected girls, I was like ""nah this isnt happening"". If their eyes were a little wider, they were laughing a little too much, if they were peeling the label of their beer bottle, if their skin was flushed and they seemed edgy... I considered that a sign they were into me, which can be a really great feeling!

If you're in high school or something and people are going to make fun of you or whatever  you might need to play it cool, but out in the real world, there is absolutely nothing wrong with letting someone you like see they're working their magic on you.

Rejection will happen but that's a different story and a different advice thread.

TLDR: Mastering social skills is about breathing through the awkwardness and jitters NOT preventing them from happening in the first place. 

(That would only be possible through drugs and alcohol -- which I have definitely used to calm my nerves around the opposite sex but it is not what I'm recommending here.)",1,evaluativist,0.09566216,0.89614546,0.008192338

I think that in a sense, since you don't interact or provide a means of interacting with you it makes them feel less secure because that's how normal people go about trusting people, feeling uncomfortable is a more general feeling than trust but trust is a part of it.

It's up to you to change that, and it's probably going to be hard right now since the first judgements have already cemented the image of you in their memory. Not impossible though.

Each person will bring up new ideas and questions. I think the best advice is to attempt to cultivate a genuine curiosity about other people.

With a teacher asking them about how they got into a subject or if they are a college proffessor reading a bit about their research can open a lot of avenues of conversation.

Classmates can be difficult because you may not always want to be friends with that person, assuming you do try to pay attention to them (in a not obsessive or creepy way), maybe they are doodling something, maybe they are reading a book, or more generally, what are their goals and plans for the future?

People like talking about themselves the more you can become genuinely curious and interested about their life the more you will have to talk about. 

Once you start a nice dialogue you can start trying to relate to people with stories of your own that you think are similar about yourself (this should be used with caution, conversations shouldn’t feel like they’re being initiated simply for you to tell a story about yourself, they’re more to highlight an aspect of the other’s story that you found interesting).

As for being funny, that one is tough, but generally humans find unexpected things funny. Most comedians talk about common and well known topics, but the punch line is something unexpected, we’ve all thought about that topic 100 times, but they thought of it in that one way that was different and unexpected. This is one reason why Dad Jokes remain a popular form of entertainment, puns are an example of this idea (even though they get overused and can become expected). Cynicism is another often used comedic tool, taking such a caricatured dark perspective on a topic as to shock others, taking this too far often results in a feeling of, “too far,” or “too soon,” too cynical can definitely make you appear too callous.

There are many more tools than this, which you can study more formally, but there is no substitute for just talking to people.

a while ago i was reading hella books on dating and shit,i still am a virgin but at least better social skills LOL, there was good shit.. mostly some weird mind positive bullcrap. but i can remember two effective concepts i learned from there. 

one- in a conversation there is something called rapport, which is basically the friendlyness of a person to another, basically little raport yields less talk, while more rapport yields more conversation. basically Rapport is how will the person be willing to open up to you, therefore predicting how the conversation will unfold and lenth of convo.

anyway there was a concept in which it talked about conversations. 

the concept of deep rapport vs. wide rapport--
think of it like this... deep rapport is very subject based. while wide rappor is basically really diverse. let me give you an analogy, deep rapport is like a sniping rifle, you are sniping a specific target or object, in the case of conversation is a specific subject, wether you be talking about clothes, finances, school, childhood memories,dogs, movies, etc is very specific. wide rapport is like a shotgun, you are firing multiple shots not just one, this could be like your daily youtube surfing experience where you start by watching a video about dogs, and next thing you are watching a video of a car exploding on a lake. however wide rapport in conversation is a variety of topics to talk about rather than one specific topic on deepRapor, think of the ""related videos"" on the analogy as how the conversation drifts, you started watching dog videos, but ended in exploding cars, but all due to related videos/convos that were ""related"" or somehow connected and therefore bled in together to link subject to subject in a conversation.

 So what does this help with fucking conversation and friends and shit you may think. well i'll give you an example.

deep raport. 

*you see a person walking with a dog* 

you say ""i like your dog, it looks so diciplined and friendly""

owner: ""oh yeah i got it last june... bla bla bla bla bla""

you: ""oh cool, i really like dogs, i remember when i was a kid i used to be so jelouse of people who had dogs....bla bla bla ""

owner: ""yeah you should adopt a dog at xxx shelter buy xxx food, buy xxx bla bla bla bla. 

notice how its always on topic of DOGS, a meaningless conversation but an engaging intresting conversation nontheless.

now wide raport

*you see a person walking with a dog* 

you: ""oh cool dog you have i like how its really friendly"" or some bullshit equivalent

owner: thanks, i really take care of my dog. 

You: how you got it?

them: oh i got it bla bla bla at the time i was in school. 

you: you reminded me of the time when i was in school, i used to do this shit with my notebook to piss of my classmates"" 

them; bla bla bla blal

notice how in wide raport you are drifting away from dogs and start to talk about school, and you can do this jumping from subject to subject back and forth referencing jokes, and building inside jokes, etc. this is valuable skill.

two- the thinking out loud
this is your conversation starter, usually you want to start convos with watever you are thinking on the spot, wether is a though of the person, their first impression, what they remind you of, stories you remember as you are talking. really it doesn't have to be ""THAT important"" or a subject to talk about it, you could even talk about cartoons, or watever the fuck, when you evesdrop on people's convo they seem kinda trivial cuz you are like ""why the fuck are they taking about this random ass shit"" but that is how convos work, there is really no criteria to what you should talk about or how long you should talk about anythying. you just have to go with the flow on this one. you just kinda have to share your memories and shit open up, and share your life/thoughts/experiences so that as in return people share theirs with you.


you seem like a kid still, probably highschool or college age kid. i know i was a social inept when i was that age and fucking around like a moron. 

One thing i do warn you about is as you learn social skills you start to uncover other shit. 

not only on the sidebar from learning about

body language, vocal tonality, how convos work. 

you'll start to uncover a bunch of shit like

fucking self esteem, trust me confidence might play such a big part on fucking convos in unbeliable, basically it test you, what you do when you run out of convo? and trust me is a lot, how do you manage other people when you are fucking up or being awkward? how will you manage yourself? how will people respond? do you even care what people think of you? are people ignoring you or am i being boring? ALL these questions i asked myself all the time when i would talk to people but don't sweat it, just keep at it.dam so many questions so many godam topics . using questions over statements, statements vs questions. cold reads, predictions, manipulation, influence/persuasion, compliance,lying, so much fucking shit, which is why there isn't a precise guide to learning socialskills, its mostly based on context, on people's personality, their boldness and self esteem and a bunch of other shit you don't even have control on that will unfold a convo one way or the other.


My recommendation is to build your self esteem, while at the same time learning social skills by talking to people more often. 

My recomendation is that, i get the impression that you don't even bother talking to people. is hard. 

but one of the main concepts you should learn one of the basic ones are even on the side bar BOOKS. Danel Wendler the author of Improve social Skills in a ted talk ""think of a conversation as if you were making a sandwich, where you put contribute and ingridient and the other person contributes an ingridient back and forth until you got a sandwhich"" basically you talk, they talk, you pay attention, ask questions,etc its all a engagement.

I think The Rock Johnson has had some pretty feminine roles but he's huge so it's still hot. It's not that you're bad the way you are, but here's been my experience. I actually dated a pretty feminine guy (wore scarves, very fashionable, feminine voice and mannerisms, feminine hobbies (didn't work out either) and complained about his diet. That's not really a woman thing, but you hear a lot more women doing it than men. I guess if you just take action in your life and try to work out I think your dating pool will be much wider. There's some sort of biological impulse towards strong men. I dated two neutral type of guys, then I dated a macho type of guy, and I dated one feminine guy and he was straight or at least he said he was so I shamed myself and ended up dating him because I didn't think it was a legitimate reason to not date him because I felt like I was awful for judging or something. He actually had multiple homosexual affairs throughout our relationship. So I'm not saying every single effeminate guy will do this, but never again will I date an effeminate guy and I even told one guy a couple months ago that I wouldn't date him because I needed somebody more rugged, I'm from the south and I'm really attracted to that rugged masculine outdoorsy type with the truck and the hunting and the fishing etcetera, Carhartt. He was devastated or angry and I really didn't mean to insult him I was just trying to tell him that it wasn't personal it was just personal preference. but never again am I going to date someone who I think might cheat on me with a man and I'm thinking that that's the biological impulse for a woman to select a mate that is most likely to stay with her. Not that you would ever do this but I think that's the biological impulse. So just try working out to gain muscle, be as feminine as u want but maybe buy a masculine coat and shoes. Unless you don't want to, but you posted here for advice. I would say that the coat and the shoes are the things that I look at the most. it's not that I'm sitting there with a checklist trying to determine if this guy is worth dating based on his coat, I'm just talkin about the biological reaction turned on or off. I had to stop dating somebody who had the habit of wearing a peacoat, peacoats and scarves always end up looking feminine. Solid color, non fringed scarf is fine. He also wore pointed-toe shiny dress shoes which looked very... Gay! I'm sorry! It's not about the shoes or the coat or the muscles it's about biological impulses I think. I'm just giving you advice on how to widen your dating pool. Alternatively, don't change a thing, and look for women with short hair and colored hair. Literally 100% of my friends whose type is skinny effeminate guys have short and or colored hair. Or overweight women . I see a lot of overweight women coupled up with short or thin or feminine looking men.

Its not really your moral code, but this is a moral code designed by a civilized society to keep people from being hurt and respecting their privacy and their life.

What I was talking about is your own moral code. Maybe the word ""moral code"" are not really a good words for this.

If you watched ""How I met your mother"", there was a ""Bro code"" made by Barney Stinson, to sum up how friends should behave when a woman is involved in their relationship (for example: ""you dont hit on your friends girlfriend"", ""friends are always more important than a random girl"" and etc). Of course this was made as joke (however some ""moral codes"" there are good to follow), but this is an example of the stuff I mean.

You need to have your own beliefs on things that matters to you. See, for example: when you don't hurt a person, do you have this feeling of ""whether I acted ok now or not""? I guess no, because this is one of your beliefs: that you should not hurt people.

I'm kind of repeating my self, because I'm not sure how to correctly express my self (fyi: I suffer the same problem as you, sometimes I look for confirmation from other people, and keep apologizing about stuff that I think I made wrong).

What I'm trying to say is that you can't just read a book or a how to about moral codes and say ""oh ok, so this is how I should behave"". You need to decide on stuff that is important to you on a less global level than ""dont hurt people"". ""Dont hurt people"" is a very good moral code, and I wish more people would have adopted it, but this is a moral code of a civilized society. Ideally, its applies to the whole society, while what I'm talking about is moral codes for **you** as an individual. If you dont have such, you are just copying other peoples behavior and loose yourself as an individual.

I suggest you to replace the though of ""was it ok that I did X?"" with the though ""Why do I question the act of doing X?"" It will help you to understand yourself better. Try to find the answer to this question. 

* Whether is lack of confidence that makes you question your actions? - Then work on your confidence.
* Maybe you question your action because this action really does not express who you are as an individual? - Then you should probably stop acting like this. Or if you really believe that this is the way you should behave then you need to give this action a time to ""grow"" into your belief. Lets say you decided that you need to be more dominant by speaking louder. It will feel awkward at the beginning, because you just planted a seed in your head ""I want to speak louder"". But this seed still needs to grow and become your belief. While it was not grown yet, you will continue to question your loud talking action: ""am I talking too loud?"" ""what if the other person thinks I was shouting at him?"" and etc. The more confidence you build, the less time it will take this seed to grow and become your adopted belief.

Joining a Toastmasters speech giving group might also be a good accompaniment to this.  You'll never run out of material of what it's like living with Asperger's and you'll have an audience of people to give you feedback.


As far as your ability to make friends, it may be more that people just need time to hang out with you to see past your social awkwardness at first. So clubs and groups organizations that you have an interest in are probably a good idea for you. Sports or activities based organizations are probably a good idea, the social aspect is definitely still there, but if you can throw a frisbee a mile or you are a great rockclimber your social awkwardness is going to be less important.


As far as your fraternity friends. They probably mean well but don't really understand what it means to have Asperger's. Confidence/being relaxed will help but doesn't really get to the source of your issues. 


As far as being teased, that's just what having a a large group of male friends is like. People tease each other as a way of showing that they are part of the group that while you may have faults you're still one of us. Somewhat related to self-deprecating humor. I'd ask a close friend in the fraternity if this is what is going on when people are making fun of you. 

Everyone has boundaries for what they're comfortable joking about. Examples include, it's fine for you to make self-deprecating jokes about your Asperger's, and even for your friends to do it every once in a while, but a whole circle of friends making the same joke at once is crossing the line. It's totally acceptable to let people know that. ""Guys make fun of me for my giant nose all you want but take it easy on the asperger's.""


Asperger's is just an aspect of who you are it's not the only one. That doesn't mean that you should deny it completely either. Better to be honest, ""yeah guys I have Asperger's it can fucking suck sometimes and I can be awkward, doesn't mean I can't kick your ass at beerpong.""


Which leads me to the idea of whether or not you have weekly chapter meetings in your fraternity. Write up the speech and ask the president if you can present it at the chapter meeting. You should probably have friends look it over first. Of course you can say what you want, but I think the idea of it would be to let your fraternity know how you feel about having Asperger's, what's cool to make fun of what isn't, let them know that yeah you're to be awkward sometimes, but maybe they can help you be less awkward by letting you know occasionally when you're missing some social signals or what it is that you're doing specifically that is awkward.


You can consider adding a signal you can pick up on with your friends for when you're doing something awkward, such as them scratching their shoulder. This may be overwhelming but you can probably have them try to pick out one thing to work on for a while, maybe you're voice pitch is all over the place or you  maintain eye contact too long. Whatever works for you. If you're in a group of people and they signal you, you can talk about it later with them. Or maybe they can give you the signal that you're doing something awkward and then give you a nonverbal cue of what it is you need to fix.


Honestly not everyone in your fraternity is going be stoked about helping the new awkward guy be less awkward. But most will understand and some will be take an active interest in helping you hopefully.


Find out from the helpful ones what your social strengths are, whether you're funny, or you have interesting things to say about music, or some aspect of your Asperger's syndrome is particularly funny that you can play on and let strangers know you're aware of some of your awkward habits (sort of). Then play on these strengths.

As far as sorority girls... I mean I was in a Fraternity and hung out with sorority girls. But honestly a lot of them suck, some are really cool, but many will be too shallow to give you the time you deserve to get to know you especially when drunk at a party. But I virtually guarantee none of the girls think of themselves this way. 

Larry king says in awkward situations when you don't feel like talking to anyone but you know you should, it's best to just acknowledge that the situation is awkward. It breaks the ice and helps everyone relax. When you're introducing yourself to someone at a party ""hey I know I can be awkward and I sound retarded sometimes but I assure you I'm not... Well I am awkward"". sorry to put it that way I don't mean to be offensive but the idea is to disarm the person and hopefully get a laugh. Of course you can word it however you want though. 


FYI parties clearly aren't the most effective time for this but it's what you have to work with. Just try to do this before the party gets going, before there are other party distractions, and the girls have had a chance to analyze you from a distance and realize that you're awkward and decide they don't want you approaching them in the first place. (three second rule) So just figure out a way to come clean. And let them know why you're acting awkward is that you have Aspergers.  If you're awkward as you say people are going to figure out something is kind of weird anyways,  might as well let them know what it is. People generally are scared of what they don't understand , you're just helping them understand you. If this backfires does it make much of a difference if you go from that weird awkward guy to that weird awkward guy with Asperger's?


So find a nice friendly one not just someone you're attracted to, because attention whores and hot bitchy girls this probably won't work with and your goal isn't to get laid right away (not to say it won't), you want her to get to know you so they can vouch to other girls for you and maybe set you up.  Act as though you're looking for a sympathetic female ear, honestly that's all you really are doing. Let her know that you have Asperger's found that you know that you  can act awkward sometimes and miss social queues. That you're not some fucking weirdo, you know you're doing it but there's not much you can do about. But maybe she can. Let her know the last time you had a mixer with another sorority you  felt like the girls never really gave you a chance to get to know you. They were bunch of bitches and you were excited because you heard the sorority was really nice. Ask her if maybe she could help you out a little bit, have her let you know what you're doing that's awkward, and or be her little pet project for the night to help you make some lady friends. Play some drinking games together, have her introduce you to her other lady friends. I don't mean play the pity card, just try to get her to empathize with you, that you thought that she looked friendly and would see past your Asperger's (it's a social strategy of giving someone a reputation to live up to). Hopefully she will see past it. Ask her she's done anything as awkward as you have lately. Girls tend to have a sense of humor about their own awkwardness  as long as you're empathizing with them.


Beyond that just trying to be interesting, relaxed, friendly and  make sure you're well-dressed and groomed (more things to ask a girls opinion on by the way).


Just talking to people at parties is hard enough even when you don't have Asperger's is hard enough. So activities are your best ally, drinking games, dancing etc.


I wouldn't worry too much about sorority girls tho. I love some of them but, as a group they suck. Like really suck. House parties are where it is at anyways, people tend to not be such social animals and kind of resent that part of the Greek system. I had friends in an outside of the Greek system and I'm well aware of the pros and cons. The Greek system is a great way to meet people but there's also a lot of social drama and hierarchy that goes  along with it.

Also you kind of reminded me of this,

Wayne Elise ""juggler"" puts on conversation boot camps directed towards interacting with and attracting women specifically body language type stuff. I'd email him and explain your situation, if that is  something you might actually be interested in. He would know more if they could actually benefit.

You’ve got me on that first one. They’re dying, it’s too late to work out yall’s issues, honesty in this instance has no value. Tell em you love me n let em die in peace.

Literal life and death stakes aside however...

They’re not dying? Again, even hard truths can be delivered empathetically. You can characterize your struggle to love them as exactly that... a struggle. Something you would want to be able to feel. You can acknowledge their own struggles in addressing the issues with their behavior, etc. If for no one other reason than that it’s far more likely to have a chance of being hear enough for them to make an effort when it’s said that way rather than an accusatory diatribe. If they didn’t ask, you only have to do that second part and only if it’s a relationship you still consider worth trying to salvage. Being honest does not, after all, mean always sharing everything you think and feel solicited or not.

Coming out of the closet is a very personal choice. If you’re not ready, you’re not ready. But if your parents are homophobic not telling them is realistically the kinder/more empathetic act anyway so again... the truth vs empathy choice isn’t actually present. If they didn’t ask but you DO want to come out... again, that news can in fact be delivered with empathy. When I came out as bi to my father for who IK that would be a challenging thing to accept and understand I acknowledged that. I told him that this was who I was, that I would always be available to answer any questions he had even if they were uncomfortable for me, that if it wasn’t something he was ready to talk about I would respect that too. I told him that this was who I was and a part of my life and that I still wanted HIM to also be a part of my life and that, however he needed to show up, there would always be a place in my life for him.

I tend to focus my appreciation for gifts on the thought/consideration put into it. It may or may not be something I’ll actually end up using and, depending on my relationship with them, I may or may not admit that... but that doesn’t mean I’m not touched by it either way.

I’m actually pretty honest about this tho I do try to do so kindly. “Yeah... but it’s cute AF! I can let it out here n here probs n maybe do a cinch here if you want it to be more slimming... but that’s you’re call, mine would be to rock your bodacious ass!” “You’re gorgeous n awesome home girl n yeah, your ass got some extra cushion for the pushin, don’t play like you don’t know that! Ain’t an issue for me n IK it damn sure ain’t for plenty of fools you might wanna holla at but if it is for you... happy to be a workout/diet buddy if that’s important to you!” Etc.

I’d say my belief is a little more complicated largely because I don’t see honesty and empathy as diametrically opposed or even necessarily directly related. For me they are two fairly separate values. 

I believe it’s always best to practice empathy in everything as best Im able... with the caveat that empathy does NOT mean never telling anyone anything they might not want to hear; it means being consistently cognizant of other’s feelings and taking them into consideration. 

And honesty is USUALLY the best policy to me, except for when I believe it would achieve nothing positive and would in fact have purely negative impact... and again with the caveat that honesty does not mean always saying every damn thing on your mind lol; it just means speaking and acting sincerely and authentically w/out deception.",1,evaluativist,0.04316419,0.94819415,0.008641635

Don't try anything fancy, rather find some simple moves that you can repeat to almost any rythm. It's alright to be repetitive, you most likely don't plan to dance for hours straight during your first try. Rather a couple minutes and then some time back at the bar to relax.

You could look up some simple steps online, but instead of learning full-on choreographies, it might be better to just watch people dancing at the club and pick some very easy moves that look solid and won't make you stand out.

If you're dancing in front of a mirror for a couple songs each day and actually manage to find the fun in moving to music, you will eventually get better.

Someone you could never hurt, like they accept you for everything you are? Ask them to ask you things. *Tell them no*. Telling people no *takes practice*. Establishing boundaries is not a thing you just ""do"" overnight. It takes *work*, it takes *practice* to identify when you *WANT* to say no, but say yes anyway, and practice *not doing it*. This is a skill I'm working on *right beside you*. I've *always* done it. Accepting invites to do things when I had other things planned, or when I don't have the ""spoons""/energy/time. Apologizing for *everything* in an attempt to lessen my perceived *punishment* for not doing so in the form of social rejection. My dude, my dog. *You can't please everyone.* Love, don't even try. Friends are going to understand. Just be real with them ""hey I don't have the spoons today to hang"". ""Aight np"". You're not going to nuke, in a 300,000 degree apocalypse, your friendships over the word ""No.""

&gt;but I fucking hate myself I’ll always fucking hate myself.

I want to hug the shit out of you. I know this feeling all too well, and I know the *crushing* weight of what it feels like to live every day under it. To feel like a *snake*, hated and feared, misunderstood. I'm not going to tell you to just magically like, or love yourself (r/thanksimcured). I'm *going* to say that there's a *reason* you feel like this, and I'm gonna venture a wild guess that something, some emotional experience *forged* your thoughts into.. this. *Listen to me and listen good*: ***It's not your fault. It was never your fault.*** 

You're worth your autonomy and boundaries. You can't please everyone, but the people who make an effort to be in your life, and the ones you make an effort toward, they *love you.* I love you.

2) You’ve just got the red pill

What people take for granted while you have conscious attention of, is like taking the the red pill in the matrix. You may discover the deeper truths in life, and existence.

If I was sleeping with a girl and she wanted me to stop and I continued, that is rape.

But legal steps are difficult to take for many reasons. So I will from here on offer personal advice rather than legal.

This man took advantage of you. He called you names and manipulated you. In a healthy relationship, these things do NOT happen. You are RIGHT to consider him a rapist, waste of space, asshole, arrogant, etc. He is NOT ""always nice"" to you. He is manipulating you with PHOTOS and with FAKE KINDNESS to try to keep you hooked in. He is doing this because so far he has been successful. 

What you need to first do is forgive yourself. Forgive yourself for ever meeting him, for partying with him, for having sex with him that one time, and for having sex with him all the times after. Your past actions do not reflect the person that you are and do not control your present nor your future.

With regards to the photos, like I said, they can be considered child pornography if you were not of legal age. Beyond that, he is just using them as a scare tactic. Something to keep you roped in. You need to think about this logically. If he realized you were no longer in fear of the photos getting out, would he still feel so powerful and in control? No.

Think to yourself. EVEN IF the photos were to get out, does that control your life? Would your parents, friends, and family abandon you over these photos? And if they were to, would the lack of support they ever had for you even make it worth caring over? If they are the kind of people that would turn on you over these photos, they do not deserve to be in your life. And that's IF he ever had the balls to do anything with the photos.

If you have a good relationship with your parents, talk to them. Tell them you made a mistake when you were younger and that he has photos of you. Your parents should be understanding. It might be hard for them but if they love you they will be a source of support not criticism. Even if NONE of your family/friends turn out to be the caring people you needed, you still have yourself. Realize that NO MATTER what ANYONE on this green Earth thinks of you, photos or not, that you still will go on living.

Next time he threatens you, tell him to fuck off and tell him you don't give a fuck WHO sees the photos. Say it and mean it. Realize that the photos, if they ever get out, can change your life in ways you may not want, but if you let this man keep doing this, he will FOREVER control your life. Free yourself. Shed yourself of your past and move on to a better future.

When you confront him, he WILL try every tactic in the book to rope you back in. He will try to remind you all the things he did for you, everything he has against you, he will call you names and all sorts of things, he will remind you of all the things YOU did and what a shitty person YOU are. When he does these things, realize that is is just a desperate cry for help from a pitiful man losing power over another human. Even if he brings up things YOU may have done, so that it's not ""all his fault"", REALIZE and ACCEPT that EVEN IF you did things too, it DOES NOT mean they make you who you are. You are going to move on from this situation even if it means moving on from mistakes you made. Even if it was you who kept coming back to him or WHATEVER the fuck, it DOES NOT MATTER. You are DONE with him and NOTHING, not PHOTOS, not THREATS, not BLAME will bring you back. Block his number, every number he tries to use to contact you, all his emails and fake emails, EVERYTHING. Begin your life anew.

I don't care what happened in your past, what mistakes you made, who you made them with, or if you kept making the mistakes. I don't even care if it is partially or even fully your fault that all this happened or is happening, as I'm sure he will try to convince you. And he will. You deserve a life full of kindness, happiness, and love. You deserve a life that is fully yours and in your own hands and control. Another human being, especially one so despicable, does NOT get to control you and manipulate you, no matter how much you are to share the blame for the situation. Yes, you and him had sex while you were drunk. Yes, you chose to continue hooking up with him. None of that matters and none of that can be used to hold you back from escaping from this hell. Because it is also your choice to continue living a fulfilling life despite of it. Is is your CHOICE to cut him off and never go back. It is your CHOICE to be happy.

You have been through hell and I can't imagine all the ways this has taken a toll on your daily life. Please, for your own sake, regain control of your life. Choose to be happy, choose to be in control, and choose to move on completely and fully.

A couple points are worth noting. People, myself included, unintentionally take things they see and hear and alter it based on their own personalities. Sometimes self-depreciating humor gets a chuckle, sometimes it leaves a person feeling insulted. This isn't news to you, but you should try to get a feel for how people's perspectives can be categorized by the way they react to different things you say and do. No one can tell you how to mesh with others because no one else is you. 

When it comes to conversation in general, it sounds like everything in a 'get to know you' type conversation comes back to intelligence. My guess? Your intellect is like a giant statue standing behind you. You used to boast to everyone about the giant statue, forcing them to compare themselves to you. Now, you've thrown a giant white sheet over the statue that towers over you. Naturally, conversation drifts back towards the giant covered statue. You try to cover it up and insist that you don't talk about it or insist to others that it isn't so large, but, no matter what, it feels like conversation will always be drawn to the giant statue that is your academic success. Practice leading conversation in a walk away from the statue. 

When you focus on keeping the conversation away from it, it's like checking to make sure the sheet is fully covering it. That won't keep conversation off of what's underneath for long. 

Your personality is a garden, walk away from the statue. If a younger schoolmate starts talking about their intelligence, listen, ask questions, etc., don't try to avoid theirs or you'll end up at yours. If a direct question is asked about yours, just say you've talked about school enough lately and you don't want to think about it. Maybe ask them to help keep your mind off of it for a while, people like to feel helpful. 

To do this effectively, you'll have to develop a genuine interest in talking about other stuff, instead of thinking about other stuff as a way to avoid your intelligence. 

Positive (towards) focus AND negative (away) focus, will always lead back towards where the focus lies, whether you want it to or not. The best way out is to shift the center of focus elsewhere. The easiest place to start is the other person. With practice, you'll be able to talk to others about yourself while keeping the giant statue out of sight until you're ready to talk about it.

1. Desensitize yourself to what you’re afraid of by little by little doing more of it. So go talk to people more, in different social settings or whatever you think will help. My brother was similar to me in this regard and went to Toastmasters, an organization that forced him to talk, mingle with professional people and even give toasts/speeches. It seemed to help him.

2. The psychiatrist thought my overall diet/health was not great for my overall emotional state. He encouraged me to eat a more balanced diet, including fresh fruits and vegetables. I didn’t think much of this for a while honestly. But once I actually tried to eat better I felt better (and wasn’t so nervous/ anxious when talking to people).

As a side note it's fun being the first commenter on posts like this because I feel the first few posts are usually probably the most impactful.

I have somewhat of the same problem where it feels awkward to sit down with a group of people I may not know well. Double awkward because I only speak English and living in Germany right now :D

For me 1 on 1 conversations are much easier because I don't feel rude for expecting them to speak English to me. But in a group Germans fall back into speaking Deutsch and so I can lose the thread of the conversation and feel excluded.

I also do the same thing you do. Casing the joint. Walking in seeing who's talking to who, who's sitting where and If I feel comfortable entering into any of those conversations / situations.

From what I can tell you're looking for a way to extend your conversations and probably onto more meaningful topics. For me the best way I've found to keep conversations alive is through asking questions. The only thing you need to keep in mind is to adjust your questions to the current topic and make them specific. 

I don't know you well, Really I know nothing about you more than this post. But even from this an entire conversation can be spawned if I pick out details about what you have said and ask you to elaborate or explain what you mean. It increases my understanding of what you were trying to explain and it extends the conversation longer so that new questions can be formed.

I find as you ask more questions and find out about the person they will start to share information you don't ask for. Sometimes the new information is interesting but a complete tangent to the conversation your having and it is your choice to comment on what they said or let it go by.

It is important to remember a few things about the question mode. try to avoid simple questions that only require yes / no answers. Try to gauge how interested the person is in the subjects you are talking about. I.e they are very animated and lively explaining something to you compared with distracted and quiet. People enjoy talking about themselves, they enjoy it even more when someone is interested in who they are but quite rightly people aren't willing to share everything about themselves so learning to read when someone is uncomfortable talking about something will steer the conversations away from an untimely demise.

About awkward silences. This is a belief. It is an idea that not talking is awkward. Silence is a natural occurrence in a conversation and should be thought of as a good thing. It happens when one party is listening the other is talking and the talker finishes and the listener doesn't respond. Why they don't respond could be any number of reasons. From them still considering what you said, to them not listening and being unable to enter back into the conversation. If they're your friend it's probably not the latter so just take the moment of silence to look around, consider what you said or they said and then when you feel the natural occurrence of wanting to speak then carry on. Feeling awkward about silences means you try to remove them which means you will never learn to be comfortable with silences.

Take home points. Ask questions. Get specific. Be interested. Listen. Learn to think of silences as positive not negative. Put yourself out there, You can't meet people with meeting new people. When in a conversation remember family, friends, occupation, goals / dreams all easy topics to start to learn about them and get a fuller picture of the person who you're talking to.

The only thing that you’re different about is a lack of meaningless false connections. Most people don’t have real friends. I have 1, and honestly even he’s questionable.

When you finish school in a lot of ways the real world will probably be kinder to you. People’s priorities really change once they have to survive everyday and the world is kicking the shit out of them on a daily basis. You will find someone and your studies will allow you to have a much better shot at a good life than most people. If you’re really that serious about suicide, at least do this first: wait until you’ve been out in the real world away from school for 5-6 years. You haven’t experienced the real world yet. You have no way to imagine what life is really about yet. Ending it before it starts means that statistically you will probably be throwing away your best years, even if you had experienced all these overrated experiences you want.",0,absolutist,0.90008223,0.089813046,0.010104674

also side note: you’re not gonna connect with everyone - in retail or in life - but it’s not a reflection of who you are or your worth. it could be something the customer is dealing with personally, especially the ones who seem unreasonably rude for no reason (doesn’t happen a lot but does pop up every now and then). if needed, breathe it out in your break room, distract yourself by helping to tidy up the store, whatever works for you, then go to the next customer in a few moments and try again :) sorry this was so long but hope it helps even just a little bit!! don’t give up!!",1,evaluativist,0.08557861,0.904905,0.0095164

When it comes to socialization, a tell tale sign you're a great conversationalist is being able to get people talking about themselves endlessly. It means they're engaged, they interested in sharing about themselves, and chances are they haven't felt able to really do so in a while. It makes you seem warm and welcoming to that person.

But lots of people don't want to constantly be corrected on their stupid opinions, they'd rather keep them and be ignorantly happy.

I rarely spoke, from preschool all the way to middle school. Allow me to write you a mini-self help book on all
the tips that helped me the most:
 
 For one, I have to be honest here my guy- you’re never going to gain friends from rarely speaking. I know more than anyone that it’s a hard habit to break, and it’s scary to put yourself out there. But, there’s a sea of potential friends out there, and the only reason you haven’t caught a few is simply because they haven’t found you yet. I used to be near-mute in school as a kid, until I began forcing myself to branch out. I practically binged self-help books, improved my appearance and fashion sense (not at all important if you’re fine with how you look, it just helped me gain more confidence in myself), and surprise surprise- as I began to utilize their advice, my friend count grew exponentially. School is just a practice ground for social development- when you start applying for jobs, most look for charisma, social skills, and confidence in your abilities. It’s better to learn now than to suffer later in life, even though it’s a hard change that takes time, along with mental and physical effort. Here’s a rough summary of the advice that helped me the most:

 Start with interesting small talk. Not just things like, “Hey, did you do the math homework?”, more jokes and commentary on different things in class. People like to laugh, and when they associate you with laugher they’ll want to approach you. Being witty is definitely a trait you’ll have to work for if it doesn’t come naturally, but it pays off. 

 Another thing is to ask them about themselves. Most people absolutely love talking about themselves, either for vanity, or simply because they want to get something off their chest, or to express their inner thoughts and choices. Compliments go a long way- go for personal choices instead of physical attractiveness, though. If someone has dyed hair, I strike up a conversation with “Woah, your hair looks so cool! How did you get the color so vibrant?”. If someone’s wearing a graphic shirt from something I recognize, I go “Yo, you like ____ too?”, which is an instant winner usually- it immediately gives you both something to talk about and something in common. These all open up ways for them to talk about themselves, and let you get to know them better. You’ll make the person feel nice, and they’ll associate you with that positive feeling. And when the relationship develops further, you can begin to share things about yourself too (only if you’re comfortable with it though). 

 Body language is everything- if you cross your arms or look down all the time, it’s telling people that you’re closed off and insecure, and hard to communicate with. If you sit by yourself in a class instead of sitting with your peers, they’re going to continue letting you sit there instead of coming up to you and bothering someone who seems disinterested in others. If you do that, it might be another reason why others don’t approach you. Try to have open body language- uncrossed arms, a confident stance, eye contact, etc. all go a very long way. 

 This isn’t just going to happen overnight- it’ll be a gradual change, from finally having a good conversation with someone to having an entire friend group. It takes time and self-improvement, but by God it’s worth it. If all of this sounds too overwhelming or too drastic of a change from your personality, just simply smiling at people every day and saying “hello” is enough for someone to eventually start talking to you. Friendliness trumps all. Above all, your mental health and true personality are the most important- don’t lose yourself in trying to impress others. Godspeed, dude.

Example 1:

Your choice of words and structure in the first example is both generalizing (""Anytime I see..."" ""usually assume"") and authoritative as hell. You're putting yourself above the article, the author, the user who posted it (since they shared it because they thought it's not garbage) and for most readers you're putting yourself above ""scientists"" even though you meant the interpretation and not the actual science behind it.

The latter is easily fixed (and against what you're trying to communicate so I'd suggest incorporating it) by changing it up into e.g. ""[...]see an article that *claims*[...]"" - you're now clearly attacking the article and the ""it"" in ""it is garbage"" hopefully is harder to misinterpret.

Another approach would be to take the angle that you hate how scientific findings are misinterpreted by media (which leads to you calling the article garbage). Now that I think about it, this is probably my favorite because it's a lot more bulletproof because you're supporting one authority instead of trying to be a different one.

Example 2:

(Did you fuck up and meant to say ""Sweden's""? I can't find Switzerland or Swiss when I ctrl+f in that article. Speaks for your conversational partner that you were told you're condescending instead of that btw. =P)

This one is harder in my opinion. You decided to nitpick a specific point and the person in question will think ""BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER POINTS!?!"" - these are the kind of spots where I'd recommend either going all out internet smackdown and mentioning all points I think that are wrong, rolling eyes and not saying anything *or* (if it's for example one major misconception in the article that really grinds my gears) appeasing to people's feelings first. ""While I like most of the article I really feel the need to point out that ..."", ""I didn't have the time to go through everything in detail but I'd like to add that..."", this kind of stuff.

In this case you picked the fact bulldozer on one spot, ignored everything else and take an easy ""victory"" which tends to upset some people.

i think, back a bit, Don't rely on looks for friendships, looks are as useful as a fish is useful when you ride a bike. which means looks don't mean shit, can you find cool people that aren't good looking? hell yeah!, can you find intresting people that aren't good looking? hell yeah! can you also find people who are good looking that are fucking annoying? hell yeah. 

my point is looks don't really matter, and you shouldn't consider them the end all be all, sure it helps with people having an impression of you, and noticing you more. BUT they don't really help nor Not help you, its neutral, looks are genes and you didn't work for those genes they were given to you.

HOLD UP, so you espect to have looks and have some social skills and say ""hey girls should be begging to jump on my cock!'




well, you have to stop thinking about looks, or attractiveness to judge people. 


i think this is the advice i read in ""improve your social skills"" (book recoms are on side bar try reading at least one). 


and its about empathy. basically it states to put yourself in people's shoes. now there is some fundamentals, all people are human, don't matter if its a man, woman, child, whatever eveyone is human, and has feelings, thoughts opinions, etc. regardless of looks, people will have their personality, and opinions, and it doesn't matter people, don't matter their looks. in fact, the most valuable advice i've gotten its been from people who are older than me and not very good looking, say if i was in your place i wouldn't of even engaged them in a conversation because, hey they aren't girls i want to fuck so why should i engage them right. 


thing is to be good at social skills, you have to talk to everyone, be that guy that talks to old, young, boys, girls, adults, engages them, and comes from a place of trying to really find the best in people, to be curious about their lifes, who knows maybe you will be hit by a story that is so impactful you will apply what that person learned for life, (this has happened to me) that is the beauty of social skills, to not limit yourself only for girls you want to rock with your dick, but to include everyone, that loner who is always sitting alone, be like 'what up yo!"", you never know how it will become part later on. 

find people valuable, not only the ""hot girls"" because of the obvious intrest of getting your dick wet.



but if you are, who you say you are, a hot stud with charisma but doesn't know how to carry a convo and it turns into an interviewer. well you noticed the problem fix that. 


to me it seems that you ask questions to know more about the person, but in doing so THEY aren't finding about anything about you!. so obviously they want to also be engaged intead of dragged. 



be the one that tells them a story. a funny experience, something you learned when you were at school that stuck with you for life (use this one people very likely will share also a story about their past that was impactful, soemthing that happened to you a bit ago, it doesn't matter as long as you are find it that you need to talk about something, well talk about that. 


The analogy, in the book ""improve your social skills"" it tell you that a conversation is like making a sandwitch with the other person. 

hey you put say (the bread) you tell them a story, 

then they put the mayo, they tell you a story, 

you listen while they talk, they'll listen while you talk. 


if you say ""hey i don't got stories to tell"", well my friend, that is where you are wrong, you've lived 24 years so far, there's gotta be something intresting, and if you don't feel like sharing, well easiest way is to do is to GO OUT, try new things like restaurants, clubs, activities hiking, shit like that, it doesn't even have to be social to talk about your hobbies, or the instance something intresting happened to you in context. 


i don't know man, i think you need to knock off the entitlement box you've climbed, ""hey i got looks! i should be getting laid!!!! why am i not getting laid!!!?"" 

no body owes you shit! not that ugly girl, not a hot girl, you want something you have to work for it, even if it requires you to start from fucking scratch and destroy the beliefs you had about yourself, about people, about the essense of social skills. 


fuck something as reading a nobel alone, could help you learn a lot about yourself, but you want quick answers, nothing comes at the prize of leaning back and browsing. if you really think you suck at social skills, well read a book! that book will give you more info and even better advice since it comes from someone reputable. you feel like your self esteem sucks, read ""the road less traveled"" by scott peck, the path is laid out, the resources right in your face, how do you want a quick fix to something that is being engrinded for years there.

- Walk tall, as if there is string attached to the top of your head and someone is pulling up on it. Make sure your shoulders are relaxed because this is key to allowing your arms swing normally.

- Keep your arms relaxed and let them sway at your sides while you walk. The point is not to focus on how your arms are swinging, just let them swing how they want to. But make sure they swing alternately, e.g. left arm in front/right arm behind, then vice versa. Avoid swinging both to the front, both to the back, etc.

If the person is just really annoying and you don't have the heart to say it, just say that you're not enjoying the friendship, that the friendship is harmful for you, or that you'd just like to spend some time apart from the person -- permanently.
If there's a more concrete reason, like the person makes you feel bad about yourself, the person always talks about himself and doesn't listen to anyone, or the person is even outright mean to you, then you can tell the person this.
If you don't want to be honest, that's fine too. Tell the person you don't have time for friends, that you're going through a hard time and want to be alone, or that you just want to focus on your studies.

Tell the person that you're ending the friendship. Pick a time and place where you can be relatively alone, and say what you have to say. Stand a bit far away from the person and cross your arms over your chest, showing that you're already retreating. Don't give the person an opening to try to win you over, promise to change, or even try to touch or hug you.


Keep it short. Don't give the person a lot of time to react.

Find the person another friend. If you want to be nice after confronting the person, you can steer the person toward a club, activity, or new location that can help the person make some new friends. This can not only be better for the person, but better for you. But you should only do this if you're feeling a bit sorry for kicking the person out of your life.


If the person finds new friends, he'll forget about you in no time at all.

Follow through. If you've decided to cut off contact with that person for good (after potentially steering him in a new direction), then make the decision final.

You think this is a categorical law of the universe? 

Believe me, attractive women buy drinks. Buying a drink does not necessarily mean they want to sleep with a man, though they might just want to talk.

You described yourself as just sitting at the bar, kind of aloof from people. Maybe she thought you looked lonely and could use a conversation?

Is that an ""ulterior motive"" in your opinion? Simply being friendly? Because it is highly, highly unlikely to be anything beyond that or an attempt to flirt.

Probably she had no agenda. Let's just do a thing and see where it goes.

&gt;getting compliments at a bar about your clothes just screams ""nice outfit, but I'm not attracted to you"" lol

Come on. You don't seriously believe this, do you? Talking about peoples clothes is a tried and true ice breaker. 

Most people go to bars to meet other people and have a good time. They frequently say, ""hey nice shirt"" and much like buying a drink, it often means they are attracted to you, but doesn't necessarily mean they want to sleep with you, just a friendly way to start a conversation about something more interesting than clothes.

It CERTAINLY doesn't mean they think you're ugly. 

You know a good way to determine how someone actually feels? Talk to them for a little bit. Everyone is different. There's no mathematic THING 1 = THING 2, she did this and so this means that.

These are strangers. You're making wild assumptions about what they think instead of talking to them.

It sounds like you're obsessed with 2 things: your clothes are nice but have nothing to do with your personality 2. You are ugly.

Not everything that happens is related to those factors. And from the story you told, even through your own lens, it's quite obvious that NONE of the events that occurred had anything to do with those 2 factors, except for how you behave.

You're overthinking this, and your thinking is off base.

My question is a bit practical, but also clarifying. Do you want to learn to dance and enjoy it as some other people do? Or do you want to learn how to feel better about yourself and clear out the insecurities you carry in your mind often times during social events? You may pick both actually. If dancing is something you really would love to be good at.

Let's start with You. Why do you believe you feel that way? And why do you believe it's not a good thing to happen to you - to have such feelings? In my understanding those feelings are perfectly fine for a person with undeveloped emotional body. Whether you'll carry them through your life or let yourself understand and accept them is really up to you. Having feelings is normal. Having feelings you decided to label bad is normal as well. Being suicidal because of that is not uncommon but it's in most people's understanding not healthy. Back to the basics. What world do you believe you are living in? Is it a hostile place, or is it a friendly place? That's a core believe, but it also reflects how you treat yourself. Do you love and appreciate yourself or do you treat yourself badly? And if you treat yourself well, probably you would not imagine yourself to be living into a hostile world. You will pick the friendly world. Are you ready to understand that you are making this choice all the time? By deciding what other people's behavior mean to you. But not only that. You have the Creator's power within you, and from that core understanding and belief, you paint on top of reality your version of it and experience it the way you believe it to be in your core. You can at any given tume change your core beliefs and the relationship you have with yourself. You can also be aware how that fulfillment changes your capacity to recognize certain things in other people's behavior. Your interpretations and reactions change, based on your way of perceiving.

Dude, it's normal to be awkward. Period. Love and appreciate this awkwardness (yourself really)! Check how Elvis Pressly was dancing back in the days. That was one of the most awkward thing people have seen at that time, and considered as a way of dancing. You can always go and visit some dancing lessons and even meet some great people and friends there. People you've never knew existed before. You have the capacity to connect with and relate to those people. You may even become passionate about dancing. It all starts with how you treat yourself, how you think about yourself, how you feel about yourself, and do you enjoy your own company! Next step based upon that clarification and if you decide to treat yourself better by your own love and appreciation towards yourself, you will really choose to believe that you are living in a good and friendly world. Because you can be good and friendly, actually everyone can if they choose to. And many choose to, after they meet another human being that has already chosen for himself/herself. Because it feels good. It feels good to be. It feels good to exist. It feels good to be yourself. And even when bad things happen and unpleasant feelings arise it's all right. That's also a way of being good to yourself - to let yourself experience those feelings and to appreciate yourself - the one capable to experience such feelings. No need for the blame game, no need for the shame game. They may happen on the surface as some form of joyful entertainment, but the core is different and everyone understands it is a joke and some of your friends may decide to perticipate in such a game for the joy of it. It becomes superficial. It always has been. You were not in the know of it. It's normal. Most people go through this one way or another. Some keep themselves away from themselves for their entire life. But even they at the end of their lives usually realize it for what it really was and let it go/get free from what they misbelieved to be true. Don't wait for the end. Do it now. And don't rush to end the life you are. It may end in its due time, it may not (most people don't know about this possibility). Live it fully and happily and joyfully and lovingly as much as you get capable of and then even some more. In a way you deserve it. In a way you owe it to yourself. In a way it's your inheritance. And I won't wish you happiness, I'd allow myself to feel happy for you right now. Because I choose to and it's my selfless way to be selfish. 😄

Let's say your friends are throwing a party soon and you hear them talking about it. 

How could you add value to that party? 

Well, if you worked at a place like Jimmy Johns(sandwich shop), you could say, ""Hey guys, I heard your throwing a party. If you need food or catering, I could talk to my boss and see if he'd be willing to give you a discount if you bought enough food.""

Now imagine if you are those other people and someone came up to you saying they could possibly get you a discount on catered food. 

You'd be like heck yea, this dude is awesome! Even if you can't get the discount from your boss and they have to pay full price, at least you come off as a guy/gal who knows how to add value to the situation. 

Do you see how if you adopted this mentality, you would probably be sought after more often. And again, you don't have to work at a sandwich shop to do this. It could be anything. But think of how you could add value and start doing it.

Thanks for telling me your story, makes me happy that you actually tried to work with my way of interacting and responding to me looking for more advice.  Especially out of all the other people there is in the thread :].  

Yeah i had a similar experience before where I would ask how to do the homework, and try to create small talk, but all they responded was either one word answers or prefer not to keep a conversation going or show no interest.  Man, imagine how I felt, or me and you.  We're just trying to connect with a couple people but they don't seem interested in getting to know each other.

But, the honest truth is that not everyone is interested to make more friends or interested in learning more about a person or getting to know them.  Everyone has a different personality and they would only click with you if they had something in common that they love and you love.  I already explained about complimenting something about them that not everyone has.  But, that's more for trying to pick up a chick/guy or you're interested in complimenting them.  But don't be too hard on yourself.  I know a couple of friends that when people barely meet them, they just answer the questions and keep to themselves.  They don't put the effort in trying to know the person because they just simply don't care.  They might just be there just to go to class and leave, or they already have a boyfriend/girlfriend and not interested in meeting more people.  People usually connect through having same interest.  You would need something that would make them go, Interesting or WOW, i would like to know more about this guy or what he's done.  But mostly people enjoy talking about themselves other than listening to other people.  

Everyone is different remember that, so don't take yourself down too hard.  Matter of fact, this semester in school, i don't have any friends in class.  I mean i talk to a couple people, but it's not like we stay connected.  However, Last year, I made two friends that i eventually got their facebook and we hung out after class and got food together.  We just clicked.  I don't talk to them anymore though, it was just a short Chemistry hang out buddies because we had same class and studied together.  Just try to pass this semester, and try again next semester.  Next semester you can be more open because you're used to rejection now.  PLUS, they never met you before so it may seem like you're an outgoing positive person and easy to talk to.  It basically means that your comfort with everybody is at neutral in the new class.  SO that means you get a fresh start.  Sometimes in the 1st day of class, i just introduce myself to people who sit around me and i get to know their name.  and ask about their major, why they taking this class, how was their summer or winter.  I then talk about their hobbies and try to see if we got any similar interest.  Most important of all is be yourself and don't try to force it too much.  Sometimes talking to someone too much, will annoy the person.  

Sorry if i made the message too long, i like to sometimes repeat or be descriptive.  Hope this helped a bit!",1,evaluativist,0.021322746,0.9547151,0.023962207

Confident people may make *you* uncomfortable because of your own negative self perception and self comparison to them. They may piss *you* off because of your opinion of the unfairness of it all. But that's not actually how most people feel.

Self confidence is actually what puts a lot of people at ease. That's one of the main reasons that confident people experience more social success. For many reasons. One is simply that when you're with a person who feels secure in themselves, you feel more honored because that person has chosen to be in your company. They're not just with you because they don't think they can do better.

Self confident people are also more generally fun to be around because they're able to engage in the present moment instead of being stuck in their heads. In closer relationships, authentic confidence allows partners or friends to also freely grow, enjoy life, and be themselves because they don't need to be worried about catering to insecurities. 

&gt;- it avoids conflict. When someone is angry at you and you're insecure, you don't fight back and there is no conflict.

Conflict avoidance and not standing up for yourself are not good things. Well adjusted people don't generally want to deal with those who just bottle everything up inside and don't communicate. When we care about someone, we want them to be able to express if they're upset so that we can genuinely work on resolving the problem. I don't trust people who bottle shit up. It usually ends up exploding later on and way worse than it would have been than just communicating like adults to begin with. 

Also, trust me, you don't want to be approved of by people who like you because you avoid conflict and just do what they want. Those are the people that will take advantage of you and hurt you. 

&gt;- it makes others like you. When you're insecure, you do what you think others will like, which gets you accepted. When you're confident, you don't want to change for others, which might mean being alone forever.

That goes against your other claims. Obviously insecure people aren't getting accepted. If they were then you wouldn't be making this post. Confident people are not doomed to be alone forever. In fact, they stand a much better chance of making real, healthy, lasting connections. And they're better able to enjoy life even when they're more isolated, because they can find value in their own company. 

It's obvious that your childhood left a lot of scars on you. I'm sorry for that. Yes, it is very unfair that your parents didn't give you the early love and acceptance that they should have.

I just wish you would take time and read this completely because I feel it's going to be a little long. Firstly, I am sorry for what you are going through and I hope you will find what you are looking for. **Disclaimer: these are just my thoughts, you don't have to accept it, you can just unlike it or delete it even, I dont mind.** And also I am younger than you and I feel like I have my shares of loneliness (no friends I could share my deepest secrets, just friends in names, there are nobody I have nearby that I could share my interests with, I don't hang out with anyone in my own class and I might be like a shadow lol) and I am not saying that I know exactly what you are going through because that doesn't bring justice to what you are going through as I don't know if it is the same as me.

First of all I am not going to give you false hopes saying that it is going to work out if you think that people love you and stuff. But that is a part of it. Just have positive thoughts. And you know how you could be positive? Here's what I figured would kick-start us to be positive. I started to find things that made me curious and exciting, and I work on that. I was lucky to have found out my interest at a young age (I am still young by the way :P lol) and I am intending to take it as my career. I realized this recently as I was really depressed for maybe two months and this week I found something that is in my interest and I started working on it by creating a small goal. I was happy to be able to be consistent with it and working on it. I get excited when I see that I am progressing little by little. Also, I enjoy the working part more than seeing my goal accomplished. But I also know that if I drop this goal at some point, depression will be back in the house. That's why I am trying very careful not to be burnout and try to complete it, so I get an accomplished feeling and use that for the next thing I might be doing. 

I believe that there are many things that as an individual we are interested in it and I don't think that there is a magical destiny for each of us or magical talent that we need to discover inside us blah blah blah. So just give a thought in what you are interested in and try to work in it. It doesn't matter, it can be anything. Painting, dancing, music, instrument, programming, tinkering with gadgets, designing, martial arts etc. etc. And you know what, maybe you might find people who share the same interests as you, and you might hit it really well. Try being curious like a kid and explore - that's what I will say.

Also, another thing I will give a lot of credit to in my life was when I started to meditate. Well it's not when I started, it was maybe a long time after I started, like three months after I started. That's when the effects of my daily-two-times-15minutes-meditation started to kick in. At the beginning I was like ""what is this, will it ever work?"", well I was really convinced when I started to experience the true results. It will take time for some to see the effect of meditation. For some it will be really quick. Fact is, it doesn't matter what the result is, just do it for the sake of doing it. 

Enjoy the path to your destination rather than waiting for the goal to complete to celebrate. Celebrate every day. Who cares if someone ignores me. I like it when I work on the stuff I like 🥳 yay. This is my current state. Me, who was just one week ago, was trying to think I might be alone for my whole life started to think that maybe I will see someone who have same interests as me. **Again, I am not saying that you should accept this as it is, you can just close this comment and move on with something else if you want and just forget what I said, it is completely up to you.** Everyday something good might happen, something bad might happen. It might be the best day some days. It might be the worst day some days that you feel like why go on more. But who cares if it is a bad day, **let it go**, it doesn't matter in the end.

I just said my experiences and my opinions and the way I tried to tackle my loneliness. I might not have tackled my loneliness, but oh well I got at least my parents who do take care of me, and now I am realizing that there were people who have actually cared about me at some point. I don't think I have to try to tackle my loneliness, I think I have to change my attention to something else.

Since you are just 18 and these are your parents, they will show resistance and it will cost you probably a lot of energy.

When I had to confront my parents to stop being over carrying, never letting me do something because ""I might do something wrong"", it was obviously not easy because this is what they conditioned themself and what was ""normal"" for them. This behavior leads me to lack taking responsibility and be overly fearing doing anything on my own without having anyone to give me the ""safety"".

It took tons of energy and work to get out of this, including open communication with my parents, telling them to stop being that overly protective and let me do my own experiences EVEN if this means that I will do something wrong and might ""burn my fingers"".

Even today they are like ""Double/Tripple check that you turn off the grill, the lights, the fridge, the oven,.."" and I have to stop them proactively like ""Hey, thank you but as I already said, it's okay. I am not stupid, it's not like I don't know this stuff. And if something happens on accident, it's called an accident with a reason because you do something wrong even if you know its wrong and even when someone told you to take care of it, so the only thing you do with this overprotective mode is to programming me into becoming insecure and losing responsibility, stop that please.""

For me, it took me like 26 years to stand up for myself because I didn't know it better. I thought there is nothing wrong with it until I learned how much it was harming me and my personality.

Spent most of my time in college depressed and barely socializing. Actually now that I think about it, I don't have any friends from college lol. Didn't date either. I'm doing a lot better now. Here's some advice:

**First and foremost, you need to address the depression.** 

I say this because depression clouds your judgement. You could've went through college getting to experience all the things you missed out on, but still felt like shit at the end of the day because you're depressed. 

You could've gotten invited to the best parties but your depressed mind would be telling you shit like ""So what? Those people don't like you anyways!"" You see what I mean? So you gotta get this under control first so you have a clear picture of your situation, the obstacles (often times they're not as high or daunting as our depressed minds make us feel they are), etc.

If you're open to taking medication: Have you talked to your doctor? Have you tried anti-depressants? Everyone is different but I had good experiences with bupropion personally. Stopped taking it about 3 years ago.  

\- Don't dwell on the past or over what could've been. Acceptance is key to moving forward. You have to accept that you didn't have a typical college experience and then let it go. 

\- It sounds like you need to do some soul searching. What are your hobbies? What do you do for fun? What kind of person do you want to be? Why are you ""not good at friendships""? Etc. 

\- Your financial situation: What is your degree in? What job do you currently have? It also might be worthwhile to try asking career centric subs for advice. 

\- If you think it might be worth trying to reconnect with old friends, I say give it a shot. Ask if they'd be down to hang out or meetup to do something. If you don't want to reconnect with old friends, it's time to try to make new ones.",1,absolutist,0.6706675,0.32505167,0.0042808536

I'm around your age with similar interests/disinterests. You need to think about how you can ever expect someone else to love you if you can't even love yourself. Women are people, just like you, with the same fears and wants and dreams, but they're not walking around asking how they can make somebody else complete. I know love is often presented to us like that (he was a drug addict until he met HER, he was kind of a shithead but SHE changed him) but women, like men, just want to have supportive relationships. They don't want to be under pressure to be a cure for your depression. 

Imagine the kind of person you want to be in a relationship with—maybe she's supportive, confident, has big dreams that she works hard towards—and that's the kind of person you need to strive to be, because that's the kind of person that she wants to be with. It's not impossible to become those things, it just takes work, time, and patience. You have to work on yourself.

A lot of people have given you good advice for working on your anxiety, so I won't address that—I'm going to focus on the ""working on yourself"" part. 

* It's good you have some interests, focus on feeding those, and trying something new. If you have a tight budget you can search for ""free hobbies"" and ""free skills""; I've seen a few popular posts like that. You could volunteer and find meaning in giving back to your community. The goal is to enjoy spending time alone, and to find communities of people with similar interests, if you are a social person.
* Go to the gym a few times a week and build up a routine. Everyone is different but personally I would recommend Stronglifts 5x5, there's a free guide and app if you google it. I have found continuously going to the gym helps my anxiety, and has helped me build confidence in myself. It's also helped me love myself, at a very basic level—sure I don't look like a model, but I know exactly how strong and capable my body is. It's also a good place for me to compete against myself, and to have solid evidence of progress.
* I would STRONGLY encourage you to take a break from dating sites/apps while you take time to focus on yourself. In your current state, you are most likely giving off really strong desperation vibes, and run the risk of attracting someone who is interested in you for the wrong reasons. Give yourself some amount of time—I think 6 months would be a good start—where you aren't allowed to use them, and you focus only on yourself. 
* AFTER you have worked on yourself and you return to these places with confidence and love for yourself, you should think about why and how you are messaging these women. They likely get about a million ""hey how are you"" messages just like yours, and have to try and guess as to who is a genuinely good person they might click with, who is a weird creep, or worse, someone who could hurt them. Make it easier for them. Read their profiles, reach out to people that you are interested in for some reason other than just that they're attractive, and show that in your message. ""Hey, I noticed you like nature—have you been on any good hikes lately?"" Your intent should be to meet someone that you get along with and want to spend more time with, nothing more. If you click, suggest meeting up in public places for casual dates. Be aware that women are often fearful of saying no because they have no way of knowing how you might react—will you swear at them, stalk them? Take rejection in stride, politely, and recognize some ""soft"" forms of rejection (like dodging the question) and leave them alone. 


Finally, you need to deal with this:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm terrified, I'm severely depressed, as I'm writing this I'm crying, I feel like I've failed at life, everyone I know my age has had girlfriends or is with a long term partner.

Romantic love is frankly not the biggest part of life. You've likely already experienced love from friends, family, etc. Focus on what you really want to accomplish with your life—excelling your career? making a difference in the world? treating everyone you meet with care and respect? These are all much, much greater things to do with your life than having a girlfriend. Also, what people your age is doing shouldn't impact your happiness so much. What matters more is the kind of people they are than whether or not they're with someone, and you should hold yourself to that same standard.

I used to have the same kind of problem, and looking back I wish I would have even thought of wanting to speak more to my teachers, like you.  I never gave it thought, I was just tense about it, and dealt with it.  

But talking to authority figures is like doing anything else...catching a football, shooting a basketball, talking to girls, returning something to a store, or whatever it is that is uncomfortable.  Its practice/repetition.  But start slow.  Friday ""Bye Mrs Smith, have a good weekend, don't party too much.""    Monday, ""SOO, how was your weekend?"" with a big smile.  Or if that is too much, just hi and bye, or thanks for helping me on that question earlier, I appreciate it.   Stuff like that.  

Its normal for many to feel this way, so understand and remember that, because sometimes just those feelings and thoughts make you tense.  When you realize its normal, it may take a little of the edge off.

edit, also, progress at your level.  If hi/bye, how was your weekend is too simple for your, ask them about where they graduated from, or their family, or more personal stuff.  Its up to you.  But I always think its good to progress slowly and get comfortable in what you talk about.

My first piece of advice is learn how to read body language and non verbal ques. This might be really hard for some people but timing and reading someone's energy as to whether they're even receptive to initiating conversation is huge. 

Timing in a conversation is also really important. As is receptivity. If the person you're talking to is in a rush or seems unenthusiastic about continuing (try to leave, backing up, doesn't offer conversation back) let them go. They might be into it another day or they might just not like you. 

Not everyone is going to like you. A lot of people literally hate me because I project authentic self -confidence that they are trying to project. It's very much a narcissist/empath dynamic that I've fallen into in many situations. Don't sweat it. They probably suck. Not everyone is good people. 

Listen in a conversation. Don't be planning what you're going to say while the other person is speaking. People LOVE to talk about themselves...LET THEM. I passed my drivers license because I asked the exam lady questions about her son and her experience in her job and she happily talked the whole time. I passed with flying colours. People will get turned off if you start with a lot of I statements and only seem interested in yourself. 

Start slow. You can't become friends with everyone and nothing happens all at once. I'm a social butterfly and there have been times in my life when I had no friends. Get to be your own best friend. Yes I went to movies and got food and even went travelling and to plays alone. If you have an authentic relationship with yourself you'll attract similar people. Find something you're interested in and participate in that community. It's the most organic way to meet people. And you're more likely to find people with the same personality types as you. I made the most friends with people who shared my passions and interests. 

I've joined many clubs and taken classes. Sometimes I don't click with anyone and that's cool. Sometimes I meet an acquaintance and a few times I've met a best friend. It's not the number but the quality. If you have one or two friends work on those relationships and learn from them. 

Not everything is easy. There have been many times I'm shy or insecure or have been young and anxious socially. It's normal. Most people feel some degree of social anxiety and nobody feels that relaxed. That's why people like me often become the joiner of people at parties or the entertainer. 

ALWAYS INTRODUCE YOURSELF WITH A HANDSHAKE. Don't make it wimpy or too aggressive. Short and sweet. Physical contact immediately reduces people's defensiveness and opens them up to you. 

Approaching a group. Make your way into the group and hold space by slowly making your full body facing with everyone else. Most groups naturally gather in circles so everyone can see each other's mouths. Don't lurk outside or to the side it's weird. Don't charge in either. Remember timing and reception. If you don't know anyone when there's a gap in the conversation introduce yourself to the person next to you. Say how you're affiliated to the group ""I know So and so from such place"". Often times someone else will be watching you two shake hands and if you catch their eye you can open up to more handshakes and introductions. 

Ask a relevant question. How do you guys know so and so? Or how do you like that class you're all in? 

Asking questions, listening, adding more, allowing them to add something, listening and responding. 

Give non creepy compliments. Nothing opens someone up faster than a well-placed NONSEXUAL compliment. 

Example: hey that was a really good question you asked it really helped me. Don't expect anything in return or even a conversation. Give it as an offering. The next time you meet they will likely be more open to talking with you. 

I love your outfit. This looks amazing on you. Can I just say that haircut suits you so well. 

Or. I just wanted to say that you did a really good presentation. I thought you were really confident while public speaking. 

Be specific not creepy. 

A well timed joke is a great way in. If you're not the joke type then laugh appropriately when others make jokes. People look to see who approves of their humour and will be more open joking with you. 

Have a pleasant look on your face. Smile. Laugh. 

Fake it til you make it. I don't always feel confident. But in situations that demand confidence I make sure to stand or sit up straight and project confidence. The energy your project is really important. If you're freaking out people can feel it and it doesn't feel good does it? Everyone likes someone who has a relaxed and self assured way about them. Even if you don't feel it, look and be the part. Wear fitting clothes and decent shoes. Smell good. If someone is close enough to smell you make sure it smells good. Scent and memory are super tied together and a good scent will linger longer in the memory than you think. 

Shoulder back. Back straight. Head up. Wear sunglasses if you don't like to look people in the eyes but at normal times and not indoors obviously. Nobody is perfect looking but if you're put together neatly then you won't stand out or set off alarm bells. 

Most people are as scared of you as you are of them. Like spiders. Be friendly. Receive friendliness.

Be yourself even if you're weird. Be your weird self and find fellow weirdos. If someone doesn't like you fuck them seriously. Just move on. Cultivate good people by being good people. Be helpful and honest and yourself. Put effort into your relationships. And put effort into your relationship with yourself.

By putting it in terms of algorithms and reverse engineering a thought process, I think you're taking a lot of the emotion out of it. Let me guess, former STEM major or working in a technical field? I'm joking, but only kind of. That's just how I'm reading into this based on the language you're using.

I feel like I should preface this by saying I have no experience using this technique (at least consciously, in the conversational way I'm talking about here), this is just a totally off the cuff answer. But I think maybe it'll be useful if my assumption about the STEM thing is correct. I studied liberal arts in school, so maybe a different perspective is what you need. 

Have you ever heard of the inverted pyramid in journalism? Basically it's a format for writing a newspaper article, a way of organizing ideas. You start with the broadest, most newsworthy information first. Something extremely general. Then you move to important details. Then other general background information. The reason it's called an inverted pyramid is because the information becomes more specific and focused the more you go down the page.

Just as a rough example:

Last Friday, police arrested a man suspected of three bank robberies in the area. The manhunt has been ongoing for weeks, and the commissioner estimates over $100,000 was taken. The suspect was caught after a brief chase, and is being held on $1 million bail.

I guess I'll let you be the judge, but I think that sounds like a fairly realistic, professional news article if you ignore the fact that it's only three sentences long. That's because it follows the inverted pyramid structure. The first sentence tells what happened: a guy got arrested because the police think he robbed some banks. The next goes into specifics: they've been looking for him for a while now, plus an additional detail of the crime. The third provides more focused detail: how he was caught and what's happening with him right now. I mean there are entire college courses on this, but that's the gist of it.

So to translate that over to something you might say in conversation:

You: Man I love penguins. Just can't get enough of those little guys.

Friend: Why is that?

You: Well I just love how playful they are. They look so happy, you never really see a sad looking penguin.

Friend: I suppose you have a point.

You: Exactly. There was this one time when I was a kid and I went to the zoo, they were feeding the penguins and this one kept tossing a fish up in the air and catching it. So goddamn cute.

Hopefully you can see where I'm going with this. As before, you can judge for yourself, but that's a basic example of a realistic conversation in my opinion. It follows a natural progression beginning with a general thought: I love penguins. The next point is that you love them because they're playful. And the next is an example of a time you saw a penguin being playful, a supporting detail if you will. 

It seems overly basic when I spell it out like that, but if you're having trouble organizing your thoughts on the fly, maybe a visual like the inverted pyramid is what you need. Anyway, I don't know if you'll find any of that useful, but I saw this question and this is what came to mind. The key is to start with the big picture, leaving room for people to ask follow up questions. If you can get them asking questions, they'll have invested something in the conversation. And that is one of the most important parts of being a memorable, interesting person (and writing a memorable, interesting news article!).

Attract people – Is it that difficult?

Let’s see how you can attract people out there.

You can attract anybody; it depends on you how you want to attract people towards you. There are two ways of drawing people’s attention- First, you can act like a gentleman and attract people with your good deeds. Second, you can be a joker in the crowd and do silly things to attract people.

In this article, I will tell you the way of attracting people by your positive behavior instead of being a jerk. That’s entirely your call what you are putting out in a public domain. So, let’s begin.

#### 1. Being Kind Never goes Old

If you are kind and nice to people, you will always attract a lot of people towards you. As being kind and humble to everyone is not that easy these days because then people take you for granted. But still, you should not change this behavior of respecting people and being kind to them.

#### 2. Always Wear a Smile on your Face

A smile is a thing that will do the work. Smile captivates people’s attention. You always need to wear a smile because interacting with somebody without smile always reflects a sense of negativity in you and builds a [bad impression](https://personalitydevelopmentcourse.com/how-to-change-your-bad-impression/). And, if you are smiling, then more people will be attracted towards you and you will able to spread much more positivity.

#### 3. Attire

Your attire plays a very important role in attracting someone. Everybody will get attracted to u when you are in a nice attire pristine and hygiene; it always releases positive vibes. Attire makes you feel confident about yourself. As a result, people feel a bond of attraction towards you. People would love to interact seeing your confident personality.

My parents called her their adopted daughter, her mom called me the same. She went on our family vacations - which was NOT a normal thing in my family. I can’t place enough emphasis on that. My parents neither could afford an extra body nor wanted the responsibility/discomfort. But she had become FAMILY. From 8th grade to junior year, I knew she was experimenting with things that I wouldn’t take part of. I knew she was more comfortable with boys than I was- by far. But I had no clue just how far she’d gone, until she admitted everything to me. We were going to bed, talking about the fun we planned to have that summer. She slipped and said ‘I’m going to have so much sex this summer!’ It wasn’t a joke. It wasn’t funny, either. She was not being responsible in any sense of the word. That was one of the last times we ever spoke. I couldn’t understand why for the life of me- I hadn’t berated or judged her. I only asked her to be careful and think about what’s best for her both short and long term. Now, I was no angel. Please don’t get me wrong. But I had boundaries that I stuck to. 
Fast forward 2 years. I run into her mom. She was working seasonally beside my permanent job. I was happy to see her but didn’t get the same reaction. She informed that she well knew what influence *I* had on her daughter, and what it had done to her. Told me that she moved to get away from the ‘bad’ people in her life- insinuating me and a boy she had admitted to sleeping with and smoking crack with (I’d never met him, still to this day -more than 12 years later- I’ve never smoked crack). I explained that I literally had NO CLUE what she was talking about and that frankly, if anything, she was a ‘bad influence’ on me. That I’d had nothing to do with any of the shenanigans she’d gotten herself into over the years. 
12 years later, all of her sisters seemingly still believe this crap. IT BROKE ME. It didn’t just break my heart, it broke ME. I had never been so confused, so mistaken, never been the ‘fall guy’ to this degree. We still haven’t spoken. I still think of her often. I still wonder WTF she would blame ME of all people. I still love her.

It's never the same thing even if it's two people together they can be deciding two different things are wrong about me or what I am wearing.

It's a personal opinion that they are expressing and are deciding to judge others based on that personal preference.

I have a more rocker style with touches of gothic pieces (Hot Topic has been a go to since I was in high school) and calling out people has gotten lots of responses. I had one really rude old man comment that someone like me didn't belong in *his neighborhood* when I was house/puppy sitting for a relative.

I didn't even know his name until after that day and my family only knew him by the classic car he drove but he decided things about me and that he could call me out for things even though I was a complete stranger.

You and you alone get to decide who you are.  But you have relinquished your right to decide to your past.  You're allowing your past to decide who you are.  You're allowing all the stupid kids from school to decide who you are.  You're allowing everyone else to decide who you are.  And this will continue to happen until YOU decide who you are.

Once you figure who you are, then you need to decide who you want to become.

Only when you make decisions to change can you actually change.  Once you've decided to change, then  you need to plan how you're going to change.  A new hair cut.  A different wardrobe.  Lose/gain weight.  Contacts vs. glasses.  Etc.

Personally, I really enjoy my job. However, one of my coworkers sees it as ""just a job"" and is never in too great of a mood. So, sometimes I find it hard to talk to him.

Anyways, during my shift today, I saw him looking unhappy and stand-offish, as always, and decide to say hi to him. In an effort to lighten his mood I ask, ""you're graduating from college, soon, right? Must be real exciting.""

He says, ""I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I still need to get a real job, though.""

I put on my best smile and say, ""But, you can work here full-time maybe, you know? Work your way up to Apple corporate.""

Here's what I was trying to do: listening to my coworker made me think he needed some reassurance things were going to be okay. I tried to accomplish this by reminding him he has a job now and could try for a higher position once he has a college degree. I understand his situation so I tried to help him look on the bright side, and replied in a way that could keep the conversation going.

He responds, ""Dude, we've talked about this before. You still don't get it."" So, naturally, I let him be. If he didn't want to have a conversation, then I wasn't going to force it.

A few weeks prior we had a similar conversation in which he also acted like a complete cunt.

On top of that, comedy is what other people find funny, so you have to know your audience. Doesnt matter what you find funny, because that's not making other people laugh. 

In general I think part of the problem is that you are underestimating the effort involved in performing any task because you aren't used to it. Guitar practice isn't fun, playing guitar is. Many hobbies take a level of proficiency before they can be ""enjoyed"". 

When I'm trying to teach myself piano, it's real easy for me to look listen to some bach or Mozart and get discouraged because I can barely play basic pieces. It took me half a year to get there AND I can already read some music and have all the basic skills necessary to read and comprehend musical notation because I took 8 years of band in highschool as a trumpet player. 

Most of my hobbies that I'm REALLY good at have years of relevant experience from my youth. Honestly, a good chunk, that's why I enjoy them. Distance running sucks, but I miss my highschool cross country team and the team comradery so I seek out team sports and team based hobbies.

Hobbies won't stick if you're not doing them for you either and it sounds like you're using them as an extension to get something else. I used to use guitar because I wanted to be a rockstar and perform on stage. I still want to, but I can't do that if I'm not good at guitar. The problem is, if I don't enjoy the act of learning to play and the instrument itself, I can't have the end goal. If the end goal is all I want, I get no reward for my daily effort, I won't play guitar.

You have no reason to stick with your hobbies because they aren't what you want, you aren't getting any enjoyment from them. Honestly, for most people, you don't need interesting hobbies, I never talk to my coworkers cause they're always going on about some TV show I've never seen and have no desire to. 

Another problem I've faced in the past was that when I was actively searching for a relationship, I focused my social skills too much on dating and that I was LOOKING to meet a person I had already defined in at least one way; a woman that I'm physically attracted to. How many social connections I could have made that might have led me directly to that woman if I wasn't so blind as to be looking for a rose in a field of wildflowers?

I don't have a good solution for you on that note because some of it's really personal. No one can tell you how to find another person interesting. There is probably a magic formula and you'll get a few of those tips and you can find textbooks on being a conversationalist and that'll get you pretty far. But you have to find that thing that make other people interesting to you. Same thing for all things that involve effort

If you can't find a personal reason to enjoy the effort involved in something, then it's always going to be a miserable experience no matter what you do.

Edit: I'm gonna just throw a tl;dr summary of my ramblings. You want something that you can't get without something else, but you can't find a way to enjoy the other things that you feel you need to do to get what you want so you aren't improving because you aren't putting any real effort towards those things. You can't put effort towards something you don't enjoy without a reward (unless it's for survival, but different topic). We work because we're paid or we wouldn't do that bullshit. You have to find a reason to enjoy what you are doing if you want to be motivated to keep doing it. And that motivation is internal. I enjoy the effort and difficulty and the feeling of accomplishment of learning new skills, that motivates me. It might or might not motivate you. You'll have to find your motivation and sometimes, the motivaters are garbage and need changed (i.e. finding a girlfriend, or as I like to call it HAPPINESS IN ANOTHER PERSON, a terrible motivator, even worse since it's about something you don't have in this example. Also not to be confused with happiness OF another person which is a place where narcissists and people with obsessive tendencies can get mixed up in particular.).",1,evaluativist,0.035082623,0.9470599,0.017857408

This seems like a lot, and it is, but it's not. It's work on one of these things at a time. Once a day, once a week, once a month. Who cares? Just do that and eventually you'll get there. I suggest going in order at least to begin with, but I think this floats together well. 

First, the easiest thing, improve your hygiene. Brush your teeth every day, make sure your skin is healthy and clean, finger nails are clean, and your hair is nice. When your mouth and body feel gross, you feel gross, because you are.

Second, your diet. Stop eating bullshit. Not all at once. A) cut out is soda. Want a soda? Chug a glass of water. Thirsty for juice or milk? Chug water first. B) avoid carb heavy food like pasta and breads. You can eat them, but the are NOT your friend at all. Always make yourself vegetables, and eat them all before you eat any other part of your food. C) If B doesn't apply, change it up. D) don't eat fast food or pizza. This helps keep your mouth and skin healthy and clean.

Third, exercise. You can lift weights, you can do cardio, you can do a martial art, swim, bike, climb. Do any of it. Just do it. And when you do keep a log of what you're doing and get a routine going. Give yourself incentives for following the routine. Have you gone to the gym for two weeks and not missed a day of your schedule (MWF split let's say), eat some of that shitty fast food you cut out in your diet.

Fourth, spend time on your hobbies. Don't have any? Find some. Need help finding hobbies? Google it. Find out what they entail. You can also start by determining what you already own that relates towards some single hobby. Don't blow $200 trying rout a hobby. Spend $20 on something, like painting supplies and use them until they're gone or broken.

Fifth, dress your best. All the time. This follows the clean mouth and body. You look good, you feel good. Get clothes that YOU like that fit you. Since you should be dieting and exercising, don't blow a ton of money on clothes (like hobbies) all at once. Shop at thrift stores, don't buy stuff brand new, because your body is going to be changing, and if you spend $100 on clothes, you're going to get discouraged to improve your aesthetics (both improving your body and improving your style). You don't want that. Don't know what styles you like or want to pursue? Google it. Instagram, YouTube, pinterst, GQ, etc. There's so much out there. Go to stores and observe people.

Six, talk to people. Standing in line at the grocery store? Ask the cashier how their day is going? Force them into a conversation because you need to practice and while it's not their job, it is right now. This is one of the best places. Be nice, encouraging, positive, and friendly.

Seven, improve your outlook. Be positive about things. Had a shitty day? Get the fuck over it. So did everyone else, and no one cares about their day, and no one cares about yours? Had a 15 hour work day? That sucks, but at some point something good happened, focus on that. Or if it didn't, find a new job or environment to work in.

Eight, remove toxic people. This one is tough, but it's easy too. Especially when you're improving yourself. You can find toxic people quick in transition phases. People will give you shit about you doing different things, those people are toxic (in general). The distinction needs to be made between constructive criticism and putting you down. People may be voicing concerns about changing because they care about YOU or they may just be talking shit bc they're projecting their insecurities outwards. Fuck those people. You know the people in your life the best, so you need to decide that. This might be your best friend, or simply a coworker, but it needs to be done.

Nine, learn to read people. This one is tough but it's essential for the previous and also subsequently dealing with new people. You can learn a lot about someone by reading them. Are they interested in speaking with you, are they mad at you or is there something going on in their life that is bigger than you and you're just inconvenient at the moment, etc. You can do this while practicing talking to people and observing people (while looking for new clothes for instance) which is helpful.

Ten, fail. You're going to do this a lot in life. Get used to it. Strive to fail. Set goals that you know are achievable but not a big deal and fail at them. Failure is rejection. Failure is being tired. Failure is pushing yourself as hard as you can, and not making it. Then accept it. All this means is that you can improve. You have a clear definition of what a better you can be.

Think about that... they talk to themselves like shit. The only way they'll feel better is if they're not alone in their own cesspool of degradation.

In my experience, I set up my own personal rules for life. Moral principles and things I wanted in life and if I didn't think it matched my future life, I tried to avoid it. I'm not saying you have to cut them out. You could even be the voice of reason. Tell them why you don't want to do these things. Stand up to them and call them out, even if you're the outcast of that group. You're only seen as the outcast cause it seems you want to make something of your life.

If you stand up for yourself, maybe Larry or Kevin are the scared boys they seem to be and can look up to you, even if it is in silence. I distanced myself from my highschool friends and slowly made new friends from work and sports teams. Eventually, one ended up having a breakdown and is alone, one came back and he turned his life around and now I'm standing in his wedding party, one became an alcoholic and didn't get clean for 12 years after highschool, one has no prospects, no savings, no education and chases women from the bars and gets used over and over and over again. The other one... I'm not even sure if he's above ground tbh.

My life... I was depressed. Hopeless being around people who felt like me inside. I was 340lbs and played WoW 16 hours a day. I had enough. I put my education to use, got a job, lost 140lbs, traveled the world, started mentoring around my city and fostered healthier relationships. We're all 33 now and out of the 5 of us, 2 of us tried to make our lives better. The other 3, still struggling, still doing the same shit.

In your message you talk about a lot of small problems and it is difficult to go into everything individually but i try my best  


1. &amp;#x200B;

It's your life and of course you have to decide for yourself if you want to have friends. We can't dictate anything to you. But having one or more friends will help you in every point of view. You can go out with friends and do something, you can meet them, play games or travel with them. You can talk to them, talk about such problems/thoughts and get their opinion. you can do so much

Of course there will also be arguments, a possible break or you might get injured, but that's all human.

2

Having a relationship can also improve/beautify your life in many ways. You have someone you trust very strongly, who loves you as you know it from films/series/books etc. Hugs or sex will give you a lot of feelings of happiness/moments that you probably haven't really known before or can imagine.

Of course, problems can also arise here, but they are human again.

So in short:

Having friends or having a girlfriend has so many advantages and it improves your life in every aspect.

The other problem you indirectly posed is how to get there.

For that I can recommend you the posts in the pinned post on the Reddit server or you can read my older messages on other posts that (almost) all had the same problem as one should/can friends.",0,evaluativist,0.046351388,0.92598116,0.027667413

I suppose that's something well have to agree to disagree on. His studies should be his focus, no doubt about that. But they shouldn't occupy all of his time. That's for two main purposes, in my mind. Firstly, doing nothing but studying and a *bit* of relaxation for 4 years will drive you insane. Besides that, it could lead to an immense amount of stress that could leave to harsh health problems. I mean, I'm speaking from experience. I'm in uni, with a double major and a minor plus research plus extracurriculars (clubs and such) plus a decent social life. I've tried the whole ""doing nothing but studying"" schtick. It was awful and completely unsustainable. Which brings me to my second point: there's no need to. You're presenting studying and a relationship as mutually exclusive, but they're not. You can have both. Maybe you're GPA will drop 0.2 points, but that's nothing in the grand scheme of things. Plus you'll be healthier with an outlet for stress. 

2) humans crave intimacy because nature wants humans to mate. The second you ejaculate, boom, desire for intimacy is now gone.

I'm not a psychologist, so I'm not going to try to disprove any of the points you make here about it (although I doubt that you have a huge amount of psychology trying either). But anecdotally, I feel that you're wrong about most of these points. I'll address these point by point.

&gt; humans crave intimacy because nature wants humans to mate.

I don't know enough about psychology to comment, but a citation wouldn't be unwarranted.

&gt;The second you ejaculate, boom, desire for intimacy is now gone.

Except it's not though. Feeling horny and wanting close emotional intimacy aren't synonymous. One is a physical desire, and one is a mental, emotional one. One I crave intimacy I want to experience a close emotional bond, where I just feel comfortable with someone and they feel comfortable with me. 

&gt;Why do you think you feel weird and slightly disgusted after you masturbated?

I don't? I feel pretty alright after masturbating. Not weird or even slightly disgusted in the least.

&gt;That’s right. That’s just nature trying to drive you to reproduce.

Eh...I'm not a psychologist, but a citation wouldn't be unwarranted.

&gt;That’s why you have the desire for intimacy in the first place. Once you ejaculate, you have basically tricked nature into thinking that you have successfully mated.

Not commenting on the wonky masturbation point (citation needed for it), the fact that you can have or desire close intimacy with friends that you don't want to have sex with kind of disproves your point. 

&gt;And as for the desire for connections? That can be achieved with Male friends. It doesn’t have to be female

My point exactly.

&gt;3) being a good partner shouldn’t be his primary concern now. 

It shouldn't, but like I said, there's no reason why you can't work toward it. There's enough hours in the day. Learning guitar or playing Overwatch aren't my primary concerns but I sure as hell find time to do them.

&gt;4) good memories can be achieved with Male friends. Memories coming from relationships specifically is not necessary as long as good memories are formed

Yeah, but like I said. If someone wants to get into a relationship, there's not reason to ignore that desire. I mean, you're even saying that you can have time to hang out with male friends and study. Under that logic, why can't he spend some of that time working towards being more comfortable with girls? Besides, you and I both know that a romantic intimate relationship is much different than hanging out with male friends. Putting both under the umbrella of creating ""good memories"" is disingenuous.

&gt;5) if I could have an awesome life where I don’t have to worry about money instead of having a life in which money flows out of my pockets like river water but I get to have a life partner , I’d rather not choose the latter.

Even though unexpected events will render your plans irrelevant, the thought that goes into creating them prepares you to improvise in an intelligent and informed manner.  

&gt; The request: how can I stop doing this?

You think because your thinking brain doesn't trust your instincts.  It tries to take over, but it isn't quick enough, so you stumble.  To fix this, you need to cultivate confidence in your instincts.  Part of it is just reminding yourself that your instincts have served you well in the past.  Another part is to ensure the right division of labor between your rational brain and your instincts.  Think of your rational brain as a corporate manager.  Right now, it's acting like a micromanager:  it doesn't trust your social intuition to do its job, so it attempts to dictate every detail so your social intuition doesn't have any leeway to screw up.  You can try to tell your rational brain to stop doing that, but it doesn't want to stand back and do nothing.  It needs a job to do, and it has a job to do: like a good manager, it should make sure your social intuition has all the support it needs to work effectively.  Then it can get out of the way and trust your intuition to get the job done.  

The support your rational brain can provide is planning.  Your rational brain can survey the situation, review relevant information, and anticipate different scenarios.  Everything your rational brain thinks about will prime your instincts to respond appropriately.  For example, if you're going to talk to people you know a little bit but not well, you might review basic information about them that will affect your choice of banter:   so-and-so has cancer, so don't compliment her on how much weight she has lost; another person's daughter won a school prize, so you should congratulate them; another person is a Trump supporter but has a great sense of humor about politics, so it's safe to joke with him about it.  Those are things that your instincts could theoretically figure out on the fly, but you can ease the burden a little bit by reviewing them ahead of time.  Then you'll have more confidence, and your rational mind will be a little calmer, because it will know that it has done what it can to ensure your success.

I also come from a military background, entering college at 24.

IMO college is one of the last environments that provides daily opportunities that encourage social interaction. Although it can seem like there is social pressure, remember that the population of the school means you can be as memorable or unmemorable as YOU want.  There are 25k people all carving out their individual lives. No, they don't all hate you. No, they aren't ignoring you. 

I'm not sure what you want. Do you want to be more social? Do you want more friends? Or do you want general social tips? In general, everyone is doing their own thing. Its entirely up to you on being social, and conversely nonsocial. 

The best thing about college social interactions is there are MANY default conversation starters at your disposal. For example: ""Man, totally don't feel like being here today."" ""Did you do the homework?"" ""How do you feel about this test?"" ""Do you mind comparing homework."" ""I couldn't figure out number X, do you mind explaining it to me."" ""Hi, my name is X. I'm having a lot of problems in here. You want to join a study group I'm helping organize?""

The possibilities interacting before and after class are literally endless. You share one thing automatically with every student, that you are in college. Its like going on a date. You can be friendly asking simple, normal questions. What is your major? What job would you like after college? What do you do for fun? Hell, make it a point to introduce yourself to your neighbor in class, every time. You'll start running into people in other classes you share. You'll run into them at the coffee shop or grocery store. Who knows, you may have similar majors and the friendship can be mutually beneficial as you help each other in diff classes. After your first year, you'll start to recognize the same faces. These people are probably in your major, and most likely your graduating class. Befriending the more responsible students among them can be invaluable. I try to make a friend in every class. Even if its not to hang out, i may miss a day and ask them to send a pic of their notes. Most people are more than willing to exchange numbers because it always helps to have a friend to help on coursework.

Join a club. There are tons and tons of different clubs. Ethnic groups (like asian student association). Societies for your major (like society of mechanical engineers). Fraternities. These are literally clubs for people of similar interests/backgrounds to hang out among peers that have similar interests. People go to the events EXPECTING to meet new people. Exchange numbers. Suggest meeting up to hang out. The easiest way to hang out with a girl is to ask if she wants to study. I mean the opportunities are there, you just have to recognize them. 

And finally, if you find certain people are turned off or don't want to hang out, or a girl rejects you, or they don't want to be your friend, Don't sweat it. Seriously, who gives a fuck. There will be 24,999 other students that may be interested. At least 10,000 other girls. Literally. Think about that.  They dont spend their free time thinking about how much they hate you, so don't waste your time worrying about it. Go to class, make friends, hang out, have fun, have sex, take risks.

The fact that you’re reaching out here I think proves you have some spark in you still, which is good to hear. I know deep loneliness. That’s my only preface. You have to break out of this perspective that you’re stuck in this situation, that nothing you can do will change it, and that it is anyone’s responsibility but yours to do so. Even if it feels like a lie. Not to diminish your efforts but you simply have not “failed” enough in your young life to know for sure you’ve seen all that’s out there for you and that you should be done. If you did, you’d have learned more or found a new passion or at least stumbled into a friend group of people that are decent enough to hang around. Maybe if you were like 50 and this was still the case then I’d have less to say, but even then there’s always another card to play. That’s what’s realistic.

Change up your environment. Do you travel? Can you move to a more exciting town? Get a roommate or two in a nicer place? You may think what’s the point if you’re going alone but the fact that you’re providing an experience to yourself can give you that fullness to life that makes people interested in talking to you. Could you volunteer at an old folks home? Maybe provide that comfort and support to other lonely people. Maybe they’d have some wisdom of their own. I don’t feel like looks really matter in terms of meeting people, so do your best to ignore the negative thoughts you have about yourself. It’s a self fulfilling prophecy that’s up to you to change.

Social skills are simply a muscle to be trained like anything else. Start small. One trick I learned that I do all the time now is when I’m at the cashier stand and there’s that quiet time during the transaction, I ask “how’s your day going?” It always gets a nice response. Do that for a month and I bet you’ll feel a little bit stronger with talking to people. Stumble through and treat yourself with grace. Your upbringing has no baring on today, on tomorrow. That’s on you now. And you can do this. Because we all can do this. You’re not especially worse than us or especially better than us.

I’m 35. In so many ways, my 30’s have been a revelation. I visited another country for the first time when I was 30! Canada, on my own, and it was amazing!

I'm not going to tell you whether they are right or wrong, or if you're right or wrong, I know neither you, nor that group.   
What I can tell you is - regardless of your faults, you as a lifeform intrinsically hold worth. Don't utilize this as a comeback to them, extolling your virtues and intrinsic worth, if they are literally as bad as what you say and what you've written isn't magnified(cognitive distortion), there's a chance they will find a way to turn that on its head. You don't need that right now. And they have things to fix themselves as well, because - yes, they too hold value.  


If you have the chance, visit a therapist, you need a support system and a therapist can provide at least one crucial pillar. In addition, add more 'positive' things to your life. Practice gratitude, 3 things you are grateful for, day and night, or just day in the beginning.   
The idea isn't to spit rainbow flavored raps, the idea is to build emotional resilience, gratitude helps us to do so, and also simultaneously starts allowing us to recognize and see other opportunities, and can help change our outlook on life. Find the smallest things you can be grateful for, atomic, protons/electrons, I'm not exaggerating here, believe me.   
As long as you think ""yeah it IS pretty great that's a thing"" then it counts for you, that's it.  
Practice cold showers at least thrice a week or daily if you can. They also aid in emotional resilience. Exercise will help as well, start by just walking/running as those are relatively simple to do without needing the whole trainer/program shebang. Essentially adding more coping methods for your life and environment, and look up classes that can teach you assertiveness in a healthy way.  


I'm tempted to add more, but too much help can interfere with growth and true independence building as well. I know things are hard, I've faced people who 'should' be better, 'should' have been more adult, but those shoulds themselves are a problem, we aren't in that world.

Idk how you act in these situations when you hang out with these people, but you seem like you’re socially aware and not off-putting. Sometimes, it’s just about finding your people and not necessarily anything you’re doing wrong. Some people click right away and want to hang out, other times the other party just doesn’t see it. It may very well be that they do enjoy your company, but not enough for them to go out of their way to initiate. It may hurt in the moment to realize this, but this is a big world and there are people out there that will appreciate you and make time for you. 

Whether you want to continue to initiate hanging out with these people or not is up to you. There’s no right answer—if you feel like it makes you happy, keep doing it. If you feel like it’s a waste of time and that it should be a 2 way street, then it’s also perfectly fine to stop initiating. 

I’m currently working a temporary job (1 year contract) that takes a lot of my time. I spend a lot of time with the same people at work, and I’m in a new place away from family and friends, so like many people I do seek out some kind of community where I am. I had a similar situation—there was a coworker I was trying to initiate hanging out with, inviting them to lunch, etc. Usually they were busy, which I understood. But then I knew they would hang out with other coworkers on the side. When I asked one day to hang out and grab lunch, I got a last min text inviting me to join the group. I declined because I had already made plans and it was really last minute. But the invite felt forced. Like hey I’ll send you the address if you want to come. 

There is nothing inherently wrong with what this person did. But after a while, I realized it was just me asking to hang out.

Your friends almost sound like they operate on a ""gang"" dynamic, in that, once someone leaves or is banned from the group they become the enemy or a target for being picked on and bullied... and THIS is not what friends do! Something is very wrong with that, and it also sounds like these individuals could either be any combination of jocks, spoiled-ass rich kids or ""Boyz from the Hood."" On that note... let me tell you a little story about me.

I know middle school and even high school can be difficult, but I also recall that I had solved these problems by the time I became a senior in high school be carefully picking my friends and associates. My dear young friend let me tell you something... I am Black and I went to an all Black school in Jacksonville, FL many years ago and before they finally integrated the students and teachers. This school had students that came from three different housing projects and a few low-income areas on the westside of town. I had to fight my way through middle school just to keep my damn lunch money and stand up for myself when one of the high school bullies decided to try and punk me. I was that Black kid who just didn't fit it with a lot of kids because I did not care for all the ghetto crap or fighting. I also spoke a little differently in terms of my vernacular which attracted problems at times. LOL I liked a wide variety of music including R&amp;B, soul, pop, rock and contemporary stuff which also translated to a variety of races on behalf of the artists that performed all of this music. I even chose a pop song to sing in my high school play, but I typically sang soul music on the talent shows. I can switch genres back and forth to this very day and think nothing of it. (I think it's very safe to say that most Black people are not into that.) I was an only child from a broken home being raised by a great-grandmother, and I was kind of different in my manner for reasons I was yet to fully understand until I became an adult. As for high school... hell I didn't even TRY to associate with people or groups that acted too ""street, violent or ignorant."" I just stayed the hell away from them because I knew I didn't really like them. However, I managed to get a little tougher to the point where the vast majority of this bunch would leave me alone as well because they could see it in my face that I didn't want to be bothered. I learned to stand up to them if provoked, and if someone pushed me too far then someone had a real fight on their hands. (People have a way of knowing who to mess with and who not to mess with... believe this.) I met up with a guy in a nightclub (or disco) who attended my high school several years after we'd all graduated. He came out and told me that he used to watch me in school and noticed the way I used to select my friends which really surprised me because he and I were never actual friends, and I didn't really think ANYONE paid attention to the few people I hung with except me! LOL Well he was right because I made it a point to only associate myself with kids who acted and carried themselves like regular well-mannered (or semi-well mannered) kids. They weren't ""perfect"" people and neither was I, but NONE of them were ignorant, ghetto, delinquent, violent or bullies. I didn't even try to date girls who acted like ""hood girls"" because I knew they represented one lane and I was driving in another. I found myself attracted to young ladies who ACTED like young ladies (and married one just like that). The bottom line is that I hate and literally despise ghetto mentality and behavior to this very day... and even moreso now because I know myself, and I have accepted who I really am as a person and an individual. If you want to say childhood and school experiences contributed to this strong dislike for ghetto behavior then you would not be wrong. lol 

Now back to you. I told you some of my personal story as a means of telling you that you are going to get a little tougher and ""stand up for the person you really are inside."" When you make the decision to do this then trust me... it will show on the outside because it will be genuine. You need to continue to speak your mind not only to this group and group leader you've told us about, but with ""anyone"" because practice is good. You should also ""focus more on your future"" in terms of your college major and the career you hope to have one day. Immerse yourself in people and activities that ""make you smile"" and focus more on the people you like instead of those whom you dislike. If you start to do more of these things, you will find that you won't even have TIME to deal with this troublesome group or any other type of nonsense to start with. Maybe it's just time to stop trying to fit-in where you no longer fit-in and move on. Just become too busy.  

I think I understand your feelings, concerns and need to separate yourself on a more gradual basis, and I respect them as well... so go ahead and do it gradually, but you can also do it more quickly if you make some changes in your own life and thinking. Start allowing yourself to experience and enjoy the company of other people whom you might have more in common with in terms of personality, interests understanding of the words ""mutual respect."" You need to move beyond this group of flakey and shakey individuals with a jerk for a ring leader because there's just something wrong with this group dynamic... and it really doesn't sound right for you because it's not who you are. You just seem to be more down-to-earth, intelligent that calm person who tolerates these people just to have friends, and people like you deserve better. 

Now here is where it gets really serious: If the spirit ever leads you to do so... you should pull the group leader away from the rest of the group or catch him or her alone one day and flat confront them about their behavior. It doesn't have to be angry... just be honest straight-forward, logical, vary rational but above all.. UNAFRAID. You will get better and more interesting results if you do this privately because if you try it in front of the group it could get ugly because you will have put this jerk on the spot and he/she will react in whatever way they deem necessary to hold power. lol If ever you decide to do this, you absolutely cannot be nervous, afraid or unsure of yourself in any way because he or she will sniff it out, sense it and try to pull a power play of some sort. You have to be ready for whatever no matter what and ready to deal with it. If it sounds like I'm saying you might even have to exchange a few punches that's exactly what I'm saying. Whatever you decide to do and however you decide to handle it... you have to stand up for yourself one way or another because you will encounter these type of people long after high school is over. I also want you to talk to your mom and dad or an older brother, sister, cousin or even a grand-parent about everything you've told me and see what they tell you as well. I will stop now, but I want you to have a great rest of your weekend and a good life. I've got a feeling great things are in store for you one day in your life, and everything you are experiencing and feeling now will help make it all come true.

Demonstrably smart people are usually focused on a passion - a skill, area of study, hobby, etc. The way you meet them is by becoming a bit more of a joiner - say yes to all invitations, make time for your favorite sport, game, or other pastime. And, as you do this, you will be putting yourself around others who like those same things. And you’ll start noticing the other regulars, and then it’s up to you to reach out and make a friend. 
 
College is a pretty easy venue. And unlike high school, you don’t have to make all your friends in the first few weeks - 5 in a month ain’t bad. But BE a good friend to those five, and let their networks start to filter in - make friends with their friends, hang at the same library/bar/cafe/spot on the lawn as them. Go to their parties. 
 
Of course, the other main way to make friends is through your classes - either you are both forced to take some required lecture and can take turns taking notes or something… or you’re in a class you thought you might really like, amongst others who felt the same. Ideally, it IS fun and engaging, but even if it turns out to be a dud, you can commiserate with these classmates. Ask them what they did last weekend.

This is a long read, but worth it.

If you’re freezing up and not talking at all, is &amp; will be the main issue.

I really hate when people say “smile” more.

Myself.

Being told to act differently, when nothing you’re doing is wrong, isn’t ok, and it sends the wrong message, especially in verb-able.

Smiling, more doesn’t do something you think it would for someone else who doesn’t do that emote, as a normal response.

Which then what happens, is the person who is uncomfortable, is trying to smile while simultaneously.

That makes for a awkward situations, because it sends several different cues.

A awkward smile can be misread;

As “omg this creep is actually interested in me.”

Or “please don’t hurt me.”

Or “wtf do I do, he is too close to me.”

If you’re interested &amp; you want them to know.

First try to communicate, that you’re having difficulty talking first.

Second be honest, say you’re feeling shy, do not assume any man will know you’re shy, and then say you do not want to be misread to them out loud to them.

This by itself makes, whoever, stop, assuming information, and will hopefully lead to better communication.

While Smiling &amp; expecting the world to be handed to you, is manipulation 101.

As all the women, for whatever reason, who have ever told me to smile more!

Have been psychopaths, thinks, I’m interested, does manipulative things to get attention or worse tells lies about me.

You feel good first, then smile about someone or something, and then you look directly at someone who you’re attracted towards.

If you’re not in the frame of mind, of, feelings good, &amp; then you’re smiling at someone doesn’t make them, interested by default less he is bat shit crazy.

As I f she sends the wrong message, then she will feel worse because she didn’t communicate properly.

And if you cannot talk, still shy and you keep freezing up.

Get in the habit of self-affirmation, tell yourself, what you plan to do to get their attention, and what you want to happen to yourself, with them and make it into a movie to yourself.

Imagination is limit, do not be scared to used, just don’t get your imagination and reality confuse.

This is a technique, literally Albert Einstein’s used daily, he literally used his imagination to figure physics out because he sucked at math lol.

This lets you build up more momentum.

Learn to make gestures, like grabbing someone close, if you cannot talk or make signs to say wait, please for one moment for me.

If he is actually interested and patient.

Like holding one finger in the air, to indicate “give me one moment” for yourself.

Put your face in your hands to partly, to indicate embarrassment or feeling shy, when you’re feeling shy so that they know what you’re feeling.

Everyone, does this, even dogs, cats, birds, bears, wolves, even freaking hyena and dolphins, do it embarrassment gesture to tell say hey I am embarrassed... lmao

If a guy, is too impatient for you, to give you even a moment to, build up, courage to talk too.

Don’t bother with him, period!

That is coming, from a man.

If a another man, cannot give you two seconds or even 30 minutes, then you need to move on, and look for someone who is going to actually going, to be patient with you.

As I have met plenty, of shy women myself and all didn’t communicate properly.

Half them have acted, like they did, while they didn’t even communicate or converse properly at all entire time.

Meaning they ask questions, maybe once or twice, and then expected me and most women do this, to hold a conversation for two people.

Which then people, get annoyed, because, “that lol dude can’t stop talking about himself?”

Lol he is talking about himself, because he wants you to like him.

He cannot talk about anything else because he is feeling shy himself, or doesn’t know what to talk about or about you to know even further what is allowed to converse about, it isn’t because “all men-narcissistic hoogaboiga!?”

Men, also need patience, from women and unfortunately, I have yet, to see a patient woman, in the 36 years I have existed, it is weird.

This doesn’t mean they don’t exist, just that I attract impatient and judgmental women.

With that said, we, both, should look for someone actually patient for ourselves, is and what should take priority, they need to be willing to communicate for starters and willing to give you, their time and not complain about what time they have left, while willing to allow you to be yourself and accept you, however you’re emoting period.

Whether you’re smiling, being shy, angry or whatever, whoever needs to stand their ground to support each other.

If I met a woman, and she couldn’t allow me to text, how I like, or make intentionally grammatically errors, because I am a dork, first and shy second, who likes to be myself or emote defaultly without me smiling, and or allowing me to make up my own stupid words.

Unfortunately, she is getting ghosted.

I hope anything I have shared was helpful!

I don’t like watching people get, half-ass answers also.

You guys should try it, the being patient, part, instead putting one worded sentence and then expecting a domino effect.

Patience goes hand and hand with the domino effect your after, in all universal cases of momentum.

You can’t do or say one thing, and expect everything to lay out at your feet.

You need to be willing to take the time, to cultivate and communicate, properly, to form a actual relationship.

This way, you also don’t end up with someone, who you don’t want to be with at the beginning, for whatever time frame your interested in or what your willing to spend, whether it is “3 months to the year crap” I keep seeing, to switch out boyfriends like shoes. Lol

It isn’t a women or men, trait either.

Both, and all genders do that &amp; therefor, it triggers me.

We all need to better, converse as time progresses, you cannot replace a entire conversation with, a god damn emote, people, I swear, to funny. lmao

I like literally, laughing as I am texting.

This is perfect, example of how impatient our race is and then has the egos the size of a building, “still”.

But third, and this is a very important step!

Be patient with yourself, while trying to communicate effectively, and care of you first and not the guy or man or whatever.

You’re prioritizing you first, he should be doing same.

As we all need to, care more and love ourselves for our own unique quirks, and traits.

Being shy, maybe, a trait now to you, you never know.

It very well could grow and blossom into something further very beautiful, if allowed it too.

And don’t date manipulative men, same goes for me, don’t date manipulative women.

You want to be happy, yourself with someone, who will not be, antagonist the entire relationship isn’t fun.

Relationships period, should feel natural and be smooth as real butter and completely stress free, people, to build, not what I keep seeing, which is trying to reenact soap scenes.

Which is, in advance creates unnecessary drama for yourself, for no reason, to further have a problem, to have to solve, prior or later, to getting to know someone else.

That Isn’t how you build a foundation for a relationship, as so far, I have been trying to date myself.

Everyone I have met, so far, has unfortunately misunderstood, me, as well.

You shouldn’t be trying to trigger yourself during a relationship by via thinking of your ex either, during a new person you are trying to get to know.

This causes assumptions by default, both and all genders do this.

And assuming the new guy or gal, you met is the cause.

As subconscious, is a trillionth faster than our consciousness, this means you are thinking about stuff that bothers you waay, before you started talking at all..

You have to practice control of what you’re thinking, and what you allow what you’re subconsciously thinking at all times, helps you grow into who you want to be, while doing different stuff, same goes for social interactions, you have to practice while being around other people.

This isn’t some childish notion, you are supposed to be proactively learning about each other, at all times when you have a chance.

9/10 I have rarely seen a woman practice this, as in most my personal cases, I am assumed of something I am not, then it is back to square one, or ghosted because of simple impatience and impartial learning, by trying to figure someone out in advance.

Because, that isn’t actually learning at all...

It literally, takes a single person on average 10 years, to fully understand another human being, and yet we humans try to fit 10 years into 1 minute, like that is logical sense. Lol

Even if you can read, all micro expressions, you still need time &amp; people are way to impatient with themselves as this leads to being impatient with each other, when we should give a damn about each other.

Which is why our society has advanced so much, we shared information &amp; we shared resources has made us pretty badass, now, we have people thinking backwards, trying to hoard everything, when that equals not growing at all.

Everyone is different, so by proxy, you need to be able to adapt, to learn to better communicate, but be, always vigilant in staying true to yourself till You decide, who You want to be and when You” want to be something else.

This way, you never regret who you were, &amp; you can be happy in the now, appreciate, who you once were, while you keep growing!

It's definitely creepy, especially when directed at women.  But her inviting smile could also be translated to ""I really like how friendly you are"" or ""you seem like a really kind person.""

You can comment more easily (less creepy/threatening) on a person's energy (like kind, friendly) or on something they're wearing. But if you have the tendency to come off as creepy maybe test this out with a female friend. Maybe stick to accessories rather than clothing covering their breasts or butt. Not that there's anything wrong with saying ""that's a gorgeous dress"" but you don't know how that's going to be taken, especially if you're not sure about how your tone of voice and body language come across. Something like ""that's a great colour on you"" might come across as more neutral. Also remember that everyone is different. One woman might love compliments about her smile or her eyes, another woman might find it invasive. Just be genuine, respectful, and keep it light. Maybe practice on people who are less intimidating at first. Find something you like about everyone you meet (not just the attractive people). Compliment people in passing. That's a lovely coat, great shoes, pretty earrings, love that colour. That's a fun umbrella. I do this with people who are walking in opposite directions on the street sometimes. It will help build your confidence.

You could say something like, ""hey, it's your again! Your smile is the best thing about my morning."" But say it while you're about to walk away or passing her, if you can. If she's standing across from you and you're behind the desk, it could be awkward for her as she's the one who'll have to walk away. Give her the compliment casually and then walk away. 

Edited to add: also, don't give compliments in order to get something from someone. That's always creepy. If you just want to compliment her because you think she's lovely and she needs to know it, that's great. It's even better because women are used to men complimenting in order to get a phone number or sex.

Anywhere in the United States, football will be king and baseball is more like a distraction during the summer unless the local team is in the hunt. Basketball, hockey, or even NASCAR is going to be popular depending on region.

There is a lot of talk about fantasy leagues. To me, that is geeking out on sports on a level I'm not interested in.

There are 4 levels of fans. 

First, there are the die-hards. They do nothing but watch ESPN all day. When two die hards start talking to each other at a party their conversation starts to become as socially toxic as two nerds discussing the relative stregnths of Java and Python.

Second there are homers. They grew up watching the sports they watch so they have the rules down. They watch their own city's teams or their particular favorites. They can walk into the last minutes of a game and have a good idea of where the game is at based on the situation.

Third there are pretenders. These are, I got to say, mostly girls, but anyone who is trying to fake interest in sports. They might wear the right jersey on game day, but when it comes down to it, they are chatting with the other pretenders about other topics during the most stressful parts of games. 

Finally there is you. You don't know or don't care about sports.

I can say you should probably watch a few games of whatever sports are popular in your region. You don't necessarily have to watch your local team for this, but you need to watch games cover to cover to understand what you are going to expect. The other suggestion that you play the games on consoles is good too, but as a fan of sports games, even I have my limit with Madden. That game is too hard for its fun payoff. But yeah, NHL 13 is superb. I hear FIFA is great. I can't comment to much on baseball or basketball games.

So, you're watching your game and you're not quite sure what happened. You have internet at your fingertips. Or take a smart bro with you to explain what's going on. 

I can tell you to appreciate football or hockey you're going to need like 20 minutes of coaching throughout the game. To appreciate baseball you're going to need 20 beers. Although baseball is often the cheapest to see live and a trip to the ballpark is a fun summer activity for everyone.

Anyway, not every sport is for everyone and some people like no sports at all. That's okay. But while watching your assignment game, your goal is to *try* to enjoy it. Put whatever preconceived notions you have about that sport or sports in general to the back of your mind. I feel like most people who strongly dislike sports either dislike the wannabe jocks who make them more important than they are or they dislike the fact that the players make so much money playing a game. Put that shit or anything like that to the side.

Turns out, maybe you don't like football because it's too long, but maybe you see something in basketball you never gave yourself a chance to see. Now you have a new hobby. If you live in North Carolina, for instance, you get to pick Duke or UNC or NC State and go out to a sports bar and watch their games.

What I wouldn't do is like learn enough to try to fake your way through a conversation. Develop a genuine interest in whatever you think is interesting.

Sports is a good conversation topic. Like politics, you can argue about strategies and relative merits of teams, but without seriously offending anyone's beliefs. Like the weather, certain games have an impact on the mood of the city you're in and it's better to understand why that is than it is to shake your fist at all of sportsdom. Like fandom, you have an opportunity to have meetups with people who share your interest.

TL;DR. Sports are fun. Try them. Allow yourself to be interested. Don't fake it. Root for the home team. Even if you try sports, and even if you don't care, if you're in a room with fans watching the game, just go ahead and pull for the home team. Don't be that guy  who wants to explain why sports rot your brain at the Super Bowl party.",1,evaluativist,0.101501085,0.8893738,0.009125135

- where it maybe starts to feel forced is if you seem to be searching for something to compliment, or if the thing you're complimenting is very far from three thing they're complimenting.

Self:

\- Have passions. (Make sure there are  topics you are excited to discuss and share with others. If you do not yet have thigns you enjoy, this takes priority as it is important for your health.)

\- Have ethics. (Make sure you have your own set of morality from which to base your interactions with other people. This is something that I personally value very much but others may not. It is up to you whether or not you wish to disregard this.)

\- Look decent. (This one is a real pain in the ass but extremely important. If you look like shit you will be treated like shit. It shouldn't be so but it is. Pay attention to how you dress, groom, and exercise. If two people are equally amicable, the good lucking one will appear more likable.)

&amp;#x200B;

Others:  


\- Others can be broken down to one major ideal and then several methods to achieve this ideal. Here is the ideal: EVERYONE WANTS TO FEEL VALUED. 

\- So... how do we make others feel valued? There are a lot of ways. Master these to start.  
1. Look people in their eyes. Yes, it matters.  
2. Smile at them. Practice your smile. No , easily seen through BS smile. Learn to believe your own smile.   
3. Talk to them about their interests. There is no way easier way to get others talking then to talk about their interests. This is harder than it seems . Don't just go, ""what do you like... oh that's cool."" Find their interests and speak in a way which is meant to have them as a mentor and you as a disciple. ""Wait, so you are a surfer? Oh, that's amazing I've always wanted to surf! Where do you surf? That's the beach with all the taco places right? Oh my god, I fucking love that place. So you're one of those super fit people I  see surfing all the time while I'm pounding fish tacos, huh?"" etc, etc, etc. It takes a LOT of practice to get good at this. You are going to seem very fake initially but once you get good you can talk with anyone.   
4. Compliment them sincerely (flattery doesn't count.) Find something you admire about the person that is neither shallow nor against their values and take earnest notice of it. There is a coffee place in front of my work. Everyone goes there before heading in and one of the girls there has one of the most stunning smiles you will ever see in your life. One day she hands me my coffee and I tell her this. I go, ""You know, (name), you honestly have one of the best smiles I have ever seen in my life. Sometimes I think I'm coming here to see it rather than the caffeine. This was true. We text each other now.   


Here is the deal mate. You're young and you have a lot of life to learn. I didn't learn these lessons until my ass had been whopped ten ways to Sunday. I still have a lot to learn. Nobody is ever the perfect statesman and the best are constantly practicing. Abraham Lincoln used to write down his negative thoughts rather than expressing them. Reagan took notes on subjects he didn't understand that he knew his friends cared about. The both of them studied OTHERS andcared about OTHERS. They slowly perfected the art of making those others feel valued.

What has actually helped me a ton is this: 

I realized at some point that people have a list in their head of what is important to them. Like their family, friends, loved ones. Or things that distress them like their self image, health, paying the bills, some drama situation in their life, etc. 

These things are all in our heads and we care about them A LOT. They take up a bunch of space in our heads like hard drives on a computer. Most of us don’t have the space in our heads to add more things to care about such as how a random person in public looks. They could make *observations* about us and then forget about it 10 seconds later because it doesn’t matter that much to them. Or they could make legit *judgements* about us, however how much weight they place about that judgement is tiny tiny tiny like 0.1% in their head. The rest of the 99.9% of their head are things they care about in their life, things that are much more important to them. And they’ll probably forget about that judgement 10 seconds later and never give it another thought. They don’t have room in their head to care that much about a random person they see. 

This has alleviated a lot of stress and anxiety I have being in public when people are looking at me. Sure they might judge sometimes, but they don’t care about that judgement about me nearly as much as I think it does. Which has been really freeing to me. I’m not 100% perfect yet, but I’m significantly a lot better.

I can't reply without ending up writing a poorly-written novel that doesn't really make sense, so that's why I usually don't reply.

All I can say is that by making ""making connections"" my main focus, I was making everything harder for myself. I saw awkwardness everywhere, I was so sure everyone thought very little of me, every failed attempt was another rock weighing me down. I focussed only on whether things were going well or not during every interaction: this made me overthink my actions and their reactions, keep silence when I should have tried to share/respond more, look awkward because I was trying too hard. 

Most people aren't apt socially to the point where they can completely change the vibe of an interaction. If I make it awkward, negative or cold from the start, it's hard for most people to make the conversation flow, to redirect the conversation away from self-deprecating jokes or make both of us comfortable enough to have an equal exchange. They feel my vibe, but they aren't able to easily change it. So they walk away instead of bringing themselves down. Which I get. Social interactions are stressful enough, I don't want the other person to make it worse. If the conversation really falls flat for you, it most likely does for them too. The difference is how much importance we give the ""failed conversation"". 

My first real friend, I met when I wasn't even trying. I was waiting for someone else who never showed up and was angry at her for leaving me alone. But I talked to this new person openly, enquired about her, share related experience. I didn't think anything would or even could come out of it, it was just an accident, I wasn't hung up on things going well, so I didn't overthinking. I was myself. Low and behold, we chatted for hours and it only hit me when we stopped. My usual self would have been over-analyzing everything I said and she said to make sure nothing was going wrong, making me less open, more awkward. 

So if I can suggest, don't give up on life. Give up on succeeding to make good connections, but keep trying to connect. Do things you love to do that don't necessarily require other people and, when you get the chance, strike up a conversation with someone. If it doesn't work out, don't focus on that. Forcefully make yourself get back to your activity again and tell yourself you did your best, you can't help what others do, and enjoy the rest of your day. Your plan was to have fun by yourself anyway, so there is no failure. It takes effort, but if you stop yourself whenever you have a negative thoughts about the what ifs and the maybes of an interaction and forcefully replace the thought with something positive (like ""I tried, I can't know why the person walked away, so let's move on"") before trying to focus on something else, eventually, it'll get easier. 

It did for me. It's still hard, but definitely easier than before. 

So don't make friendship or love the goal behind an interaction. Make striking a conversation the goal. That way, you succeed every time. The friendship is a nice bonus.

Practice helps too. Less social exposure for me means more social anxiety, more trouble with redirecting my thoughts away from overthinking. 

We only control our own actions, not other people's and not the outcomes. So it's up to you whether you start conversation or reach out to people. You can share your expectations as well. That's really all we should focus our energy on. 

We can't control others. We can't know what's going on in their heads and we are all biased in a way that makes our perspective on things (including other people's words) unique. It's basically a luck game. You just gotta click with someone (as in, have similar perspectives on interactions) enough on a certain levwl to build a good relationship. Sadly we can't control that, so we can work on being happy doing what we love, being happy with ourselves and letting people see that, so that we'll eventually be able to meet enough people to get to the right kind of people and once we get there, they get to see our true selves, not the layers and walls of coping mechanisms.

It sounds like you're a nice enough person but ask yourself if people only come to you when they want you to do them a favor or do they hang out with you for the hell of it and you occasionally do them favors?

I definitely get where you're coming from - I'm very much the kind of person who wants to fix the problem!! There are two main things I've found that help me empathize and care when people complain to me:

Firstly, I try to think of listening to the complainer as a solution in and of itself-- what I mean by that is, instead of finding an outside solution to the problem, consider that their solution is to find someone they trust and care about to confide in. Your listening and simply being there and acknowledging that it sucks can be a solution right there,  because it reassures your conversation partner in a big way, even if nothing's actually being solved. So that can help in terms of framing it and trying to get away from seeing it as pointless.

In terms of what to do now, then, I find that a combination of active listening (which, okay, 99% of the time active listening is kind of bs but when you're receiving a vent, restating what they're saying both helps you understand where they're coming from and proves you're invested in the conversation), as well as a focus on validating their emotions is important. When people vent, I find, they're rarely looking for solutions-- they just want reassurance that either someone feels the same way they do, or the way they feel is valid/normal. So being like ""oh man I totally understand why your boss yelling at you would make you feel terrible"" can be super helpful!!

Finally, I think it could be helpful for you to put up boundaries about what you do and don't want to engage in conversation about! If someone seems like they're going to be complaining about a person, you can even say like: ""I'm grateful that you trust me enough to vent about this person, but I feel uncomfortable hearing vents about other people. What else can I do to help you feel okay right now?"" Or something like that ^.^

It's a process for sure and reframing the discussion can help, but overall it's a journey to work on empathizing and caring when you're on the receiving end of complaints and vents. You got this!!",1,evaluativist,0.028478822,0.9590512,0.01247002

You can't appreciate your introversion (thus, stopping to be jealous) if you try to change yourself. 

Being introverted is not a bad thing. Why do you want to become more extroverted if you feel fine spending time alone? If you enjoy your time when you're not with people, then you're not missing out on anything. If you do not want to go to parties, why do you feel like it would be better to go? Being introverted doesn't necessarily mean that your social skills are bad, and you shouldn't force yourself to be what you aren't. Reading your text, I couldn't help but feel that you force yourself to want something you don't want (if that makes sense). You don't want to hang out with people, but if you don't, you feel like a loser. Why? I mean, I know the feeling. I'll never in my life be an extrovert, and I very often feel like my surroundings evaluate my introversion as a bad thing. But it's natural for an extroverted person to think so, because for them, being with people is desirable. Unless they understand that this is not the case for you - that you enjoy your time alone or with a few best friends just as much as they enjoy their party-time - they are going to falsely deduct that you are missing out on something. Don't make the same mistake. There are a lot of people trying to be extroverted, (because in this world, we have to constantly prove and present ourselves), even if they aren't. That can make you very unhappy. In the end, only you know what you enjoy and what you want to do and you shouldn't let yourself be pressured by others. Or more, by their conception of what is good and desirable. 

Still, this is only my opinion, and if you really want to be an extrovert (think about it, do you really want to be an extrovert? Or do you feel like you have to?) , then, honestly, I don't know, I don't think I could change that part of me. Of course you can train interacting with people and you can improve your social skills (which is useful even if you are an introvert, and being introverted doesn't mean that you're not socially competent.). But I don't know if you'll ever enjoy it as much as an extrovert would. It's good to be able to communicate with people and be social and likable when you talk to them, but you don't have to be extroverted in order to do that. 

Sorry for the long answer (I had a rough time, too, coming to terms with my introversion). I really hope you figure things out and I wish you all the best.

Why carrots are orange, how you saw a perv in the club, about how you forgot to lock your door. What you did today, what you want to do.

Talk to entertain yourself. Picturing it like this helps me alot.

Laughter in my opinion is the best medicine. So aim to make yourself laugh and happy. If your stuff is doing silly dancing, messing about with people and making them uncomfortable then do that.

You'll notice those people who've been friends for years and years they sometimes rarely speak to each other. Just because your best friends dosnt mean you have to talk every second of every day of every week.

You need to find the formula, the balance between talking about yourself and them. Do more stuff, experiment, be silly, because then you'll have funny stories and more opinions about things.

What I'm trying to say is there's no answer, no framework to learn. And if your worrying about what to say to people and what to talk bout then that already tells you enough.. your spending time on thinking about what to say to people when you should be just getting on with your life and making yourself happy.

Everyone is different. For instance another thing I notice works is when I don't focus too much on the conversation. That way if my mind is focused on a task rather than the person I give a natural response saying what I truly want to say instead of filtering and thinking and thinking again and thinking I can't say that because of this or this because of that or this because it's too suggestive of this, etc.

My advice to you: I know this might sound counterintuitive, but perhaps you could try telemarketing. I doubt it will be challenging to get a job in telemarketing, as they'll take anyone who has a set of vocal chords. With your anxiety, it obviously will be difficult at first. If you are tenacious about the job, then you will likely overcome your anxiety. Also of note is that you don't know and never will really know the people you are calling. They are of little significance to you and don't matter. They're just another 7 digit number in your call list. No need to be anxious about what they think of you, or messing up (Is this where your anxiety lies?). While you are employed as a telemarketer, you can search for a long term job that caters to your needs. If the job causes you to slowly overcome your anxiety, you'll have a whole new array of jobs that you'd be able to apply to. Everyone has a different definition of what it means to succeed in life.

Another pointer is to stop talking too much. I have a friend who drones on and on about topics, even when people aren't listening, and people don't really like him for that (they find him too chatty). Most people don't tell him to shut up because they're being polite (I'm one of those who actually tells him to shut it because it interrupts my inner voice).

**Damn, what do you think makes you struggle the most? is it anxiety. Because if it is, I just want to say things that helped me when I felt similar to your situation**

People that are anxious tend to be hyper-critical of themselves and all their mistakes.

### 1.) No need to be perfect

You are allowed, if not encouraged to make mistakes. People (I included) often go over the things they said wrong, etc. However, you can make mistakes socially just as much you can make academically.

Seeing things logically helps. When you get a question wrong on a math test, do you automatically get a 0? Of course not, you can even get a few questions wrong and still get an A. 

Try to think about what you do in a convo overall. If you're being a positive person throughout the conversation, nobody is going to think of the dumb/rude thing you said. Most of the time, you think you said something wrong, but it really wasn't.

I realize that many people assume that if others do not show a positive response to what they say, then they substitute that feeling for disapproval;/hostility. When they might have just been indifferent.

  

**2.) Girls are Usually more Nervous** 

Not trying to come off as sexist, just speaking based off what I hear, see and learned.

When guys are interested in another woman. Most of the time they need to approach to make something happen.

Most of the time it is the women dropping as many “hints” as possible to attract another man.

Women tend to be much more emotionally intelligent and connected then men. That’s why it may seem that they are so good at keeping there cool but being approached is nerve-racking for them as well.

How would you feel if a beautiful woman started talking to you out of thin air? Most would have trouble keeping their cool

Secondly, you’re in a frat, people look up to you, not the other way around. You have the “social validation”. Many other women probably assume that you’re just not interested in them and would be flattered you spoke to them.

 Key tip:

* **Catch a glance? Smile at them, if they      smile back, you’re in the clear**

**If you catch them looking at you twice, go ahead: I** realized that most women tend not to check out anything that walks by like many men do.

I don't. Never said I did, though. But I did know basic human acumen and logic and how that dictates their actions.

No it's not, and for the most part I don't have any.

I never said it was an IMPOSSIBILITY. I'm sure on many occasions it was a genuine compliment, bc there's no reason to just approach someone and lie...lol. My point was it doesn't at all read like a pick up line.

&gt;that most women WAIT to be presented with fuck opportunities

They do bc most of them have so many options. When you can hop on tinder and get a million matches or just go to a club and have 50 guys hit on you, you don't need to take the initiative. Sure, if a woman sees some guy that looks like Henry Cavil she'll be proactive, but beyond that she has no reason to.

Think about it: when someone speaks, what is it they want? They want to know they're being heard. They want to feel like you're listening. They want to feel like you care. They don't necessarily care if you agree or not and they aren't necessarily trying to convince you that they're right. They just want to be taken seriously. They want to feel as if their thoughts, problems, fears, and ideas matter.

This is why counter-arguments and problem solving are usually the wrong approach. Because unless they're looking to debate you, which I highly doubt, they're not trying to convince you of anything. And you need to realize that, even if you're right, you aren't changing their minds this way. That's not how you convince people. That's not to say that your opinions don't matter, or that facts don't matter, or that you shouldn't speak up when you feel strongly about something, but you should recognize that, if this person is important to you, it's *more* important to show that you support them as a person than show you don't support their ideas.

Besides, here's the two possibilities you're dealing with: either they're completely set in their ways or they aren't. If they're set in their ways, what makes you think they'd ever change their minds based on *anything* you could say? Their position is inherently irrational (from your perspective), which means there's no rational way to convince them to change their position. Better to just focus on what you have in common. On the other hand, if they're flexible, then you still need to realize you catch more flies with honey. By letting them voice their wrong (in your opinion) thoughts, asking them non-judgmental questions, and not shooting them down, you're proving that you're flexible, too. You're willing to listen, you're willing to respect their opinion, and guess what? In time, they might soften to your opinion as well.

So just... don't. Don't do any of that. No arguing over unwinnable points. No fixing things unless people genuinely seek your advice--but even then, treat lightly.

In short: just listen. Get good at listening and the rest will come in time. And the funny thing is, people want to talk to listeners, but they also want to hear what they have to say. Watch someone like Charlie Rose and see what a brilliant listener (and questioner) he is. He'll often weigh in with his own take, but he's a brilliant interviewer and his greatest skill is in the questions he asks and the rapport he builds with his interviewee.

There's actually a method you can follow. It's pretty straight-forward:

Ask a genuine question that's fun to answer (people like talking about themselves, their hobbies, and the things they're passionate about) &gt; listen closely, don't interrupt, and try to avoid annoying stuff like finishing their.... sandwiches &gt; when they've answered, respond by repeating back what they've said--not verbatim, but in a way that shows you were listening, and show genuine curiosity and/or enthusiasm for the subject (if this seems fake to you, ask yourself: if you aren't enthusiastic or curious, why are you talking to them in the first place?) &gt; at this point they're either talking to you about a subject you can relate to or something you know nothing about, if you can relate, do so (""yeah, I love old kung fu flicks as well, my favorite is Enter the Dragon...""), if you can't relate, demonstrate your interest by asking more about it (""the closest thing to a real kung fu movie I've ever seen is *Shanghai Knights*, but I'd love to watch some proper ones, I just don't know where to start""). You just repeat this process of ask &gt; listen &gt; relate &gt; ask over and over again. You'd be surprised how quickly people will open up to you, because most people, even the good talkers, aren't very good listeners, and *everyone* likes a good listener. And don't be afraid of showing your ignorance. People love to help other people. They love to initiate new people to the niche stuff they're into. Whether you've seen a bunch of kung fu movies or not, you're essentially making yourself available to hang out with in the future. You're opening the door to future hangouts/dates/parties/whatevers where you'll watch kung fu movies together, either because you love them too or because you're curious and eager to see more.

Anyway, hope that helps.

Gauge this and respond accordingly'). They demonstrate reasoning by explaining WHY certain behaviors work ('She'll like you liking her') and show calibrated confidence appropriate to dating advice - confident about general principles but acknowledging the need to adapt to specific situations.","[""It depends on the person"", ""Some girls love... some despise. Gauge this and respond accordingly"", ""If she isn't receptive... ease up and just stay friendly"", ""Learn about her"", ""Observe"", ""respond accordingly""]","It depends on the person you are going with, having said that, here is some stuff that comes to mind:

**Do**

**1. Smell nice.** 

**2. Listen well.** Learn about her.

**3. Be natural with compliment timing and delivery.** If you don't mean it, don't say it, if you do mean it, say it like you mean it.

**4. Observe.** When you watch people interact with their surroundings, you learn a lot. If she is into dancing, by all means dance, even if you feel silly or embarrassed, don't take it all too seriously and have fun.

**5. Be confident** How? Be yourself. 

**6. Apply the appropriate amount of chivalry.** Some girls love a guy who holds the door, some despise. Gauge this and respond accordingly.

**7. Enjoy her company.**  Have fun. Laugh. Make eye contact. She'll like you liking her.

**8. Take a risk.** Be brave. If you feel scared or nervous, it's an opportunity to overcome it and slay the dragon of intimidation. Do something unique in that you follow your heart, which is sadly a rare occurrence.

**DON'T**

**1. Be gross.** 

**2. Make her feel uncomfortable.** 

**3. Look at other girls.** some guys have a major problem with this. I don't get it.

**4. Worry about what she's thinking.** 

**5. Forget to check your swag.** Guys have to go to the bathroom and check themselves out to make sure they are still looking fresh and clean, too.



**6. Be afraid to touch her.** Starts with a light back hand touch to her shoulder then turns into a small rub of the shoulder. You have to flirt with her and part of that is physical contact, basically. So it starts small and escalates from there. If she isn't receptive or is the type of person who doesn't like to be touched, ease up and just stay friendly.

**7. Leave too late.** Always leave her wanting more. This goes for anything. Time to wrap it up during the falling action, not the denouement.

  
I would also prepare a [mind script](http://colorgenicstest.com/Goldin-Girl-Column/how-using-a-mind-script-will-make-your-life-better.html) for yourself so that you don't give off nervous vibes at certain times.

Good luck, man.
