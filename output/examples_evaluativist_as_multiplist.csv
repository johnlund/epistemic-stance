Lets flip it around, how you feel if the tables were turned? If this girl find you attractive, but she finds herself to ""ugly"" for you. And because of this is to scared to admit interest. But in your eyes she might be the most beautiful girl in the world, and neither of you would ever know. Just think about it.

If you do care a lot about others opinions it's up to you to put in the effort to vocalise your thoughts and views - it's not really a waste if you're getting what you want out of it right (making sure people understand your viewpoint). And at that point it's not about you changing minds. Or have a conversation/debate around this topic another time just specifically with the people you care about. 

If you don't care what these people think, and believe that they might agree with the person ranting... Why do you care about making a certain impression? Just move on with your life.",1,multiplist,0.005385411,0.18586202,0.80875254,True,evaluativist_as_multiplist,0.80875254
soc_1189337,206,evaluativist,high,high,substantive,"The writer systematically explores multiple possible explanations for the woman's behavior, weighs them against each other, and provides reasoned advice based on this analysis.

Maybe she didn't like the question. Maybe she didn't like the question coming from the new person. Maybe she was busy. Maybe she had other things on her mind and didn't want to make small talk about her dog at that time. 

What if you thought the question was nice but for whatever reason she thought it wasn't nice? I mean who knows, that could be the case. And if it were the case you ought to respect that, and if you don't respect it then you aren't being nice anyway. Asking what you consider to be a nice question and then expecting a nice reply could definitely be considered a rude and entitled attitude. And I mean it sounds like you're now doubling down on that by ignoring her now. 

So yeah my advice would be to be nice. But by nice I mean be open minded and flexible. Try not to get twisted up over small slights. How you feel is largely on you, and how you react is absolutely 100% on you. People aren't like vending machines where you put in a nice question and get out a nice response or something.

The bottom line is, my female and male friendships were the exact same(at least for me). Basically, it didn't matter much wether the friend was male or female, I made them both the same way, and the experience was practically similar. We usually had similar interests like gaming or anime and it was nice, we had normal friendly fun with each other. You don't even really have to have common interest for you to become friends, there could be some other way to connect. 

My opinion about this is that there is no difference between the two. Male or female, same same. All you gotta do is talk to them just as you would talk to a female, take interest in them and get to know them as you would with any other friend. If they think it's you hitting up on them I think it's kinda dumb. Either way, it's just my opinion.",1,multiplist,0.004607418,0.22561063,0.76978195,True,evaluativist_as_multiplist,0.76978195
