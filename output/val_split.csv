Yet, you can't quite live your life solving problems by assuming people are assholes, so I even treat assholes like better parts.

I can say, I am someone who is often dominant in conversation. Now, this isn't because I like to hog the conversation but I'm really knowledgeable about a huge range of subjects, so I often just happen to have the most interesting thing to say about a subject, and this is coming from a person who is not hugely confident and not necessarily inclined to think I have anything interesting to say, but when it's apparent that I do, it is apparent, and that's often.

However, have no doubt that I'm conscious of this fact and regretting it and hoping that someone else will be able to contribute in some way so that I'm not just talking at a group of people who are staring at me. I want to know what you have to say and I want to hear your contributions and see what they reveal about you, your perspective, your existence, history, whiles, ways and whims and I'm hoping that any opportunity in conversation will make everyone I ever talk to ever into a better friend than they were before the conversation. So, say whatever you think you should, and interrupt me if you have to. I don't mind, it happens naturally and accidentally all of the time and if I have anything really important to say (never), I'll just find another chance to work it in.

It goes against everything I thought I understood. If someone were to be hard to get replies from (texting context), it gains value over messages that come easily. However, conversely, one would think getting so few messages implies a lack of interest in you. Objectively, that is how it appears.

Of course, there are any number of reasons for slow replies, or lazy-looking replies (those kill me). But I will say this, yes, I see how getting few responses increases the value of each much the same as hearing ""I love you"" from someone that never says it would be significant. But, just the same, if someone never told you they love you, you could assume they don't really care all that much. Yes, those are totally different things that I don't think quite compare well, but hopefully you get the idea.

I personally fall into the category where if I get messages often, it tells me that I am valued. For someone to make time to chat with me, well of course, it must mean that I am important to them and they WANT to chat with me. And no, it does not take much time. Yes, people get busy, and I realize that. It does sound needy, but everyone wants to be valued. And if they are taking the time to message you often, it may decrease the value of each message, but it shows how much THEY value YOU, and of course, it works both ways.

When you don't have the time, tell them so in a way that still conveys that you DO want to chat, but can't. Getting a response four hours later still sucks, no matter how you slice it if you have no idea what's going on. Best balance is to know the person well and what they prefer. For example, my best friend rarely reaches out and does not like long, (my forte) or excessive messaging. So I have do dial back with her, but I almost get nothing even though I know she cares. Really not fair. I've tried telling her, but hey... You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. Different strokes at the end of the day... Everyone is different. 

Edit: Also, everyone's definition of ""often"" is different. For me, getting a single initial message a day or every couple days is nice. Keep in touch! I like to do the same. Also, being able to have a real text **conversation** instead of every response being hugely delayed is nice. Otherwise, it seems forced. ""Ugh, I guess I'll reply.""",1

Throughout high school I've often felt bitter for not being naturally/comfortably sociable. I've felt depressed as a result more than once. 

That said, it seems that a lot of your anxiety stems from the fact that you care a lot about what others think of you and you want them to recognize you, but it's falling short. The first step in this case would be to live for yourself. Don't live to please anyone else. Great people never became great because they tried to fish for compliments from others. Pick up hobbies or routines because they're fun or interesting, not because they'll get you attention. Start thinking about doing things that will help you become the best person you can be instead of doing things that will help you become super popular. You can only depend on yourself to be happy; you can't expect others to fill that role for you. (This is not a blanket rejection of all social interaction- a good social life comes as a side effect of being happy with who you are as a person. Once you're comfortable with yourself, you can be more comfortable around others). 

But seriously, who gives a fuck if you don't date people. The real morons are the people who are counting dates like video game statistics. I'm single and could not care less about the fact that guy x is seeing girl y. Honestly, you have some pretty tough balls to ask that girl out despite the pressure. Fuck them for trying to shape who you are. It's up to you and only you to do shape yourself. 

Now on porn: check out /r/nofap or /r/pornfree to start off. Then, start immersing yourself into other activities. Exercise does a lot of good for deterring meat-beating. Literally distract yourself away from porn. Being away from your bedroom, where you can get too comfortable, helps. 

Lastly, keep smiling. There is no reason to ever give up a positive attitude. Smile for yourself if not anyone else.

For sure I'm sure, that you have some need for something else in life. Example, you may be more passionate and prefer to love rather to lust. It's up to you! Don't let society choose what you want to do with your life.

Secondly, get clothes you think would look good on you from your perspective. Worry about how it changes your look afterwards. Then, accept it. That's what I do. I get skinny jeans because I love the way they look on me.

You are an individual. Do whatever YOU like because that means that is you. If you don't like wearing makeup, don't. It's better to associate with people who like being with you because of YOU and not because of the YOU you try to be. Just go with the flow.

I tend to over-think things alot too.

What are your hobbies/interests?

'Creepy' could be from a few things, i want to put it out their that this isnt confidence related because ive seen confident people act creepy by coming on too strong.  What makes them creepy is not picking up on social cues or coming on too strong.  So perhaps you are trying too hard and misreading their body language or words.

We have to play with the hand we were dealt and you cant convince people to like you.  If someone you're not into tried talking you up and getting clingy at a party you would be a little creeped out.  Youre not into them so you try to softly give then hints but they are persistent because they are coming on too hard and are trying to change your mind.  They are being creepy.  So with this perspective you need to respect the people you are trying to connect with.  You cant force them to like you and even if you could, would you want to be with them then?

I dont know you or how you act.  But id say take the pressure off of looking for a partner.  Work on talking and listening to people.  LISTENING TO PEOPLE!  Your whole motive for talking to people is to date them or hook up, which is also creepy.  Work on social skills.  Genuinely talk to people and listen, ask them questions and show interest.  By showing interest, you will be interesting.  And i really hope this gets through to you.  You should work on talking to people at your future gatherings.  Not for the prospects of finding a mate, but to genuinely get to know someone.  In todays workd everything is quick, you swipe right or left, you skim their profile.  But if you genuinely talk to people and show interest in their life and their hobies, they will open up to you.  If you can carry a conversation and keep them talking by asking questions youll be heading in the right direction.  By you being interested in a deeper level, youll be ahead of everyone else in the dating field because youll make them feel special.

Most of this advice comes from a bachelor party i went on.  One of the groomsmen was a therapist who was married.  He could talk to anyone.  He would go up to tables of girls and be their hours.  Every bar we went to he would disappear and talk to anyone, everyone!  He even said he was interested in talking to people, like he really enjoys it.  But he helped teach a few of us young lads on how to talk to people.  And the truth is people like to talk.  He would even say tell them to tell you about something and then show it in action.  Its silly and easy but seriously.  He would be like ""tell me about that tatoo""  and the girl would tell.  It sounds stupidly easy because it is.  Talk to people about shit they are into,  youll get to know the real them better.  And dont make it all about wanting to fuck them.  Take a few months to genuinely talk to people without alternative motives.  Youll make friends, become more interesting and probabaly find someone you would get along with nicely.

This is quite a strong worded opinion and will stick with someone and that someone will ultimately judge you for it. Do you think this has happened to other people you talk to?  

Perhaps the people your 'hanging' with don't resonate with you. You mentioned you like to be alone at times and others are partying. Maybe you need a more mellow crowd. Do these people know you like being alone at times? Maybe this is why they don't invite you as much? 

There's also the view that other people are thinking the same of you? Why didn't he/she say hi to me at work do they not like me? Why does he/she never hang with us, do you think he/she is avoiding us? This will likely sway decisions and perhaps they think you want to be left alone. Do you not use whatsapp or other messaging apps that utilise group chats that discuss events and what's happening with the weekend?

You come across mature with a logical way of thinking looking at things from different perspectives. This can clash with stubborn people. 

Ultimately, I think you're being too hard on yourself and are having a slight complex. It sounds like you want to be liked by particular people.

People who are slightly more aware of themselves than average will often become aware of some habit of theirs, for example you called it ""annoying"", but it could just as easily be ""a quiet voice"", and just because they are aware of it they become *more* reactive to it and lose some control of the ability. In short, they feel like they have been given a part of themself that they didn't ask for, and want desperately to get rid of it.

But this belief hides behind the greater belief that some part of you can be wrong, or broken. In reality, while you may have tipped the balances a little, you are not broken. And in fact, it is the very part of yourself that you might feel is broken that is crying out to you to be understood and cared for, because something is being lost in translation here.

Because all of your feelings and expressions are worthy of your attention and it is only through the care that you show them that you will be able to project yourself, a whole and packaged ego, outward in a way that nobody will be able to deny as complete and strong and beautiful.

I don't think there's any need to bring these concerns up with her and it would probably do more harm than good, at least at this stage. 

For dates, in my experience if you like someone it makes little to no difference what you actually do with them as spending time together is what matters. My personal preference is to go to a bar early on. It's not a big commitment, it's informal, and I find a couple of drinks helpful when getting to know somebody new. As long as you use a common sense approach and don't pick something they will obviously hate that's not really something to worry about. Just look at the sort of things she normally does and choose something inline with that. 

As for what to talk about, that's just not something you can ever really plan in advance. I mean you could try but she could say one thing which takes the conversation in a totally different direction to what you had planned anyway. The best way is to sustain conversation is to be a good listener and be present in the moment, if you really pay attention to what people are saying you'll find that it's actually much easier to naturally find good responses then if you're too busy in your head worrying about what to say next. Some people say to keep the conversation light early on and avoid topics like religion and politics. Personally I don't agree with this, I'd rather just discuss anything that naturally comes up. I'd also rather find out what somebody thinks about the big things early on and know if there's any fundamental disagreement which may be too substantial to overcome. This is just my preference but really I think any subject is fine (with common sense exceptions).

I wouldn't really worry about the nature of the 'man's role' in a relationship, these roles are a lot less defined than they used to be. Just focus on enjoying your time with her and getting to know her and let your relationship naturally develop.

The only real solution to get more comfortable with face to face conversations again is practice. I'd suggest putting yourself out there as much as possible and look to make some friends, or at least just find opportunities to speak to people.

1. The Smile
2. The Clothes
3. The Swagger

First learn to smile. **Practice by smiling everywhere you go.** Start with simple objectives, like 'I will smile till I leave this store' or 'I will smile on my entire commute to work.' This will help you not only seem friendlier to those around you but will actually alter your brain chemistry and make you happier overall.

Second recongnize that **if you want to be treated seriously then you must dress appropriately.** I personally feel more confident in what is considered Business Casual clothing than other clothing, but everyone is different. Find a style that makes you feel like you will be respected. That will help cement your ability to exude confidence because you will be treated better.

Third **master some good body language** aka Swagger. Swagger doesn't mean act like a dick or start walking like a drunk John Wayne, it means learn to apply good body language cues to everything from your walk to your dictation style. You'd be surprised how often enunciation and pronunciation can change the meaning of a sentence. If you add to that strong body language, you'll be golden.

Fifth, before you’re going to meet him, look in the mirror and give yourself a great big smile for 5+ seconds!!

From what I've read, oftentimes a stammer can be traced back to a particular incident during childhood, which a hypnotherapist can help you revisit and (in theory) help you change your perspective on it.

For example, the book ""Hypnotherapy"" by Dave Elman quotes several examples of patients who stammered. One of them (off the top of my head) started because when he was young, there was a traumatic incident, which when he was questioned about it, made him stutter because he didn't know what to say at the time. This translated to a problem throughout the rest of his life with stuttering when nervous or even in casual conversation. The therapist was able to ""talk"" his ""subconscious"" into believing that this event was just a one-off and shouldn't have any bearing on his life, and lo and behold, the patient stopped stuttering.

There will be some who say that there's no evidence base for hyponosis, apart from anecdotal evidence, but tbh if you're a stammerer, you might as well try it. I stammered from a young age (and still do, a little bit) - it improved throughout high school but was still annoying with certain letters and words (Ns, Gs, Ds in particular). After reading about hypnotherapy and learning the theory behind it, I saw a hypnotherapist and I THINK it may have helped.

You have to think about what matters to you in your life. 

A good question that brings your core values to light is: 
 *""What do you look for in a good friend?""*

Before I understood my core values, my answers would have been ""If they're nice to me and fun to be around."" But those are really vague qualities anyone can have. Think *deeper*. 

Do you value respect? **What does respect mean to you?**

What do you think about manners? About health? Do you consider these important things? 

**What ticks you off?** For me, if someone doesn't even try something when I suggest they try it, that annoys me because they aren't taking me seriously. So, something I value in a friend is that they trust me and listen to my advice. 

This list can go long and deep, and you don't have to understand all of it. It might also change over time, especially as you become more aware of it. And that's okay! But, as you learn bits here and there, you'll become more confident in how you carry yourself, and who you are. 

I would suggest checking out the sub r/stoicism if you have no idea where to even start. It's based around a certain set of core values, and you can decide if they make sense to you or not. 

I find that discovering your core values is super important to mental health overall. It helps you feel like you have more of a purpose in life, because it's up to you to uphold your own values. It's like a more complicated moral compass. It can guide you when you're lost, and help you understand your intuition more. (Listening to your gut is also super important!

&gt;I didn't build that cage, deciding to change things won't change the fact that I am not a person who wants to give up on who he is. Would you want to do that about yourself? I don't think so.

Yes, all the time. I used to be a person who is afraid of spiders, I worked on giving that up. I used to be a person who ate meat on a daily basis, I was convinced by arguments and am a vegetarian now. I used to be a person who ""sucks at sports"" for 20 years, decided to fuck it and try some out for a month and it suddenly was enjoyable once I found an awesome group. 

All of this would have been impossible if I decided that I'm spiderscared, meateating, sportsucking and incapable of being attractive. It took me a day to stop eating meat, a year (20h per week) to not feel shit at sports and I'd say about three years of going out 2-3 times a week and meeting women that I started to believe that I could genuinely be attractive. In retrospect, I'm glad I did these things but I felt pretty shit about all of them for a while.

I used to believe that to have success with women I have to make sure they know how much I appreciate them as soon as possible and be genuinely nice to them at all times. I was confident that everyone who doesn't do that is just an asshole, I even believed for a bit that women in general suck or that I'm just not made for that stuff.

Turns out I had to actively work on improving that area of my life just like any other and it ended up changing the person I am into someone who is happier, more competent and makes the people around him happier. I met hundreds of awesome people, even more not-so-awesome people and among all of those a few handful of candidates I wanted to spend more time with and among all of those one that turned into the relationship I wanted from all that work.

Or if things dont go according to plan, can you roll with the punches and keep a positive mindset? People see how each other reacts to different situations and may determine how much they like you from those moments.

Do you do nice things for others without expecting things in return? Generosity creates friendships. Buying someone a drink or giving them a small random gift could leave a good impression of you.

What kind of skills do you have that can make others happy? Maybe something like cooking, or curating some kind of art or whatever it is, share it with others. If you are good with computers or building things, offer to help people who may not be as good. It may require some of your time and a good amount of effort, but building and maintaining relationships is not going to be easy. Sonetines all it takes is helping someone once and they will love you forever. You may get burned and have people try to take advantage of you. If that happens, drop them immediately as it is better to have no friends than to have terrible ones.

Maybe a bit superficial, but people are drawn to nice clothes, cars, cute animals...present yourself in a manner where you can gain peoples attention without having to try too hard at conversation. Someone might walk up to you and compliment your jacket or ride and it makes it easier to start a convo from there

As for where to start..maybe just at work? These are people you see often and have some familiarity with. Practice building repoire and give people good impressions of you. Word of mouth spreads quickly..if everyone finds you pleasant albeit not really outgoing, you will eventually be invited to outings and from there can branch out. Or, if you help someone, they may offer to take you out for lunch or a drink, and from there you can build a friendship.

First start with exchanging pleasantries to smiling passerby’s. The world is a friendly and playful arena: be mindful, be genuine, and opportunities will naturally open up to you.

Silent treatment works pretty well.
Sometimes the other person will calm down and wonder what they did.

There was a guy who lived on the same floor in a uni apartment place with me. He never said a word. If he passed me on the way on the corridor towards the kitchen or vathroom, he pretended to not see me, and never returned a ""hi"" if i greeted him. So i learned to ignore him, and he was nothing t dead air after that.

Now it's getting a bit more frustrating. I recognize people by voice. So when there are occasional people in places that I frequent and that talk with everybody else but not me... Your choice. If people don't want to talk with me, it's ok. Silence has never bothered me, but since I miss the visual nonverbal cues - sorry, it just means you are not there for me to even notice.

There are so many reasons a person might not like another. Opinions on something, nonverbal (visual) cues, sounds, habits of the other person, or the other person could remind of someone else that was unpleasant.

I ask him how he learned to draw, what inspired him to continue drawing, where does he learn to draw, does he use expensive art materials or not?

My best advice would be to learn to enjoy it. It seems like you wish you were just a ""regular"" person, but guess what you're not. Struggling to *fit in* is a gift. Put yourself in situations where you feel normal and can be creative and free.

The reason that people open up to you is because you're emotionally intelligent. I often used to feel the exact way you do. But guess what? People feel comfortable around you when being that open. If people like being around you and find you funny then it means that you're saying the right things. Also, it is not about what you say, but how you say things.

What you say doesn't matter, what matters is how your words make people feel.

On the other hand, feeling low about your self-esteem is indeed an issue that can often be helped with counselling. However, one thing that helped with my self-esteem is doing the things that I truly enjoy. You have the gift of being naturally charming.

This means that you have the ability to pursue fields and paths that most others won't be able to. Also, remember with great power comes great responsibility. Once in a while the world gets blessed with people that can spread joy.

I relate very heavily to this. My advice is, do what comes naturally to you, and things that feel smooth. I'm certain you'll realize that even though most of your peers might be able to do things that you can't. There are certain lanes that you would be able to dominate.

Anyway here are a few tips:

*Set goals - Have an idea of what you want. Want to lose 10 lbs? Win a marathon? You have to take a first step regardless of what your goal is. If you want to run a 10K and the first day you only walk 1 mile then guess what? That is still 1 mile more than you walked yesterday. Set a goal for every day, no matter how small. Accomplish something so you can say you have done something that day, or as I say build momentum.

*Monitor your self-talk. Confidence is key - Use words and phrases like ""I can"" and ""I will"" instead of ""I can't"" or ""I'd like to."" Speak and think like you will accomplish a goal and surprisingly you will easier than just wishing you would. If you take on a goal with the mindset that you WILL accomplish it, then you will most likely achieve your goal. You need to be confident, not an egotistical ass that thinks because he has a penis he's the greatest gift to the world.

*Be honest with yourself - If you had a shit day and just want to chill and watch bad movies and throw a few beers back then go for it, but don't make it an everyday thing. Get back on that horse tomorrow, just keep building that momentum. Everyone needs to rest and reflect. It helps you learn and grow.

*Try. Give it your all - Here is why I am so focused on pushing myself. Four years ago I was a senior in high school getting those little brochures from schools like West Point and Brown University. My test scores always hit the roof but I never applied myself because high school sucks ass so my GPA dropped two whole points from my freshman to junior year. I decided instead to enlist the military. It was the best decision I ever made. Gave me stability and a standard to live up to. Now if I had applied myself I could have gone to Brown University and been the class of 2012. Now who else went to Brown U in that time? A miss Emma Watson. I could have gone to school with Emma fucking Watson. This shit pisses me off because I didn't take an opportunity and could have had a completely different experience in life because I didn't apply myself and just try. I missed an opportunity because I failed to apply myself. I would have met Emma Watson if I tried. In no way do I regret the path I have chosen because of who I am today which leads me to my next point.

*Accept your failures and learn from them - I honestly do not understand why people search for a meaning to life. I don't know why I am here and I don't care. I am here. I am me. What can I do? What do I want to do? You are going to try to meet a goal and eventually you will not. You can dwell on it or, and this is a big OR, you can move on, see what went wrong, and try again. Think of how many times it took Edison to create a light bulb. He refused to quit. Now he's dead and people still know who he is because he did not let his failures define him, he defined them and learned from them to meet his goal.

*Don't quit - It's a simple as that. Don't quit. Don't ever quit. Don't ever think about quitting. You might want to quit. Things might not be going the best but you cannot ever quit. Life never goes to plan so prepare to face the unexpected.

*Love yourself and others -I'm not talking about that bullshit Hollywood running through an airport to catch someone. Hell, everyone has a cell phone these days, just call them because you'd never get past security anyways. I'm talking about a basic, low level, background noise type of love. Help an elderly person with groceries, pull over for a stranger stranded on the side of the road. SHOW COMPASSION. Give others the smallest act of kindness because you do not know how it will affect them. It could save their life, it sure saved mine. Basically a stranger to me bared her heart and soul in front of about 90 people about she had been sexually abused by someone close to her. Through her my mind was set in motion. I asked myself why I was miserable, why am I living the lonely, fruitless life I was and I could not come up with an honest answer. She set off a spark in me that is now a roaring fire...sounds really cliché but I have energy flowing out my arse now.

Laugh when you do something stupid, help others when they're down. Be yourself but first find out who you are and what you are made of (mettle because I like that word). Try. Don’t quit. Smile and have fun. I can't guarantee this will work for you because it is up to you to take that first step. You are here, no one is stopping you. So what are you waiting for?

If you are female, its usually enough to be skinny and not hideously deformed to get male attention. Men are more shallow than women and prefere better looking ones, but theyre so eager to get girls that even a 3/10 will get tons of messages on tinder and so on.

Surprisingly, its not that different for men. Yes a 10/10 man will have women approach him constantly, but thats an extreme case.

Have you considered that at this stage, that's the wrong thing to focus on?

I could not survive with such a narrow focus on self-improvement. I had to improve *everything*, all at once, in order to survive my abuse. I never knew in advance why I would be punished, so I literally had to be beyond approach in *everything*. The only way I could survive is to be so close to *perfection* in every aspect that other people couldn't tell the difference, even if it weren't truly attainable.

&gt; I think it would benefit you to really dig deep and work out why you hold such powerful false beliefs, and what you can do to start changing that thinking.

**They are NOT false beliefs**, and *nothing* will make me ""change my thinking."" If they were false, you would be *exploiting them*, not trying to change them. You want them changed *because they are correct*, not because they are false. You are a con-man trying to find a flaw in my armor - and not finding any, trying to con me into making one. I'm smarter that that.

&gt; I don't fully know your circumstances - maybe everybody in your immediate life is your enemy - but thinking that literally everybody on the planet is an enemy is stopping you from forming connections.

First, if it were the case that everybody in your immediate life is my enemy - then *why the fuck wouldn't everyone else be one too??? Why the fuck would there be a ""boundary"" between those who hate me and some mythical race of people who don't? How does that boundary defended? Why don't the people who hate me exterminate those who don't?

*Read a goddamned history book* - they're *filled* with stories of people exterminating people who think differently. Why do you deny this side of humanity? Why do you insist this is not an ever-present behavior?

Second, when I found out you people hated me **so much** that you all were willing to *inflict PTSD on a child,* that proved beyond a shadow of doubt that ""forming connections"" with the human species was **impossible**. I no longer *want* ""connections"" with the human species - I want *distance*. I want you assholes *out of my way* and I'll do whatever is legal to clear you out. 

But, of course, your whole life you've been *in* my way, and you'll fight to your last breath to *stay* in my way, just as you have been all my life. My true flaw was not realizing this sooner. My true flaw was in my childish belief that a ""connection"" could be ""formed"" with you, when you all were shouting in my face that you'd never accept such a ""connection"". *That* was my false belief, and that has since been corrected.

&gt; Until you're able to accept that some people are legitimately nice, there's not much I can do to convince you otherwise.

I'm not *supposed* to ""accept"" that some people are legitimately nice, because they've already shown that *they'll never be nice TO ME.* I have no doubts that they are nice to you or others. What you are confused about is this weird idea of ""universal niceness"" - that a person who is nice *is compulsively nice to everyone they meet* which is **absurd**. A person can be nice to one person and cruel to another - all people have the potential to be Janus-faced. Your refusal to accept this is why you're so confused. The same people who have spent your life being nice to you have spent the same lifetime being cruel to me - **THE SAME PEOPLE**. Only children think so simplistically that they believe that a person can only act one way toward everyone.

&gt; I don't endorse bullies of any variety. I don't blame you for developing irrational beliefs and a hair trigger response to human interaction. I don't believe you're a bad person.

And I don't believe you actually believe all of this. I believe that you will tell whatever lie is necessary to breach my defenses, because **to lie is human** - you *can't* tell me the truth, because, as a human being, you hate and fear facts because you can't ""break"" them; they stay true no matter how hard you attack them. So in order to cope, you all have to compulsively lie all the time - you refuse to deal in facts entirely because you fear them that much.

&gt; You speak a lot of people forming an impenetrable wall and stopping you from becoming their friends. I honestly think you are trying to befriend the wrong people. If they have already made up their minds, you need to try cracking into a different social circle. But I know your response to this advice is, ""There are no other circles. Literally everyone hates me instantaneously."" 

No it isn't, *asshole* - my reply is: I can't have been trying to ""befriend the wrong people"" because I eventually tried to choose circles *at random* precisely to hedge against this possibility. I specifically carried out an scientific experiment in order to prove what I was doing wrong only find out I couldn't prove that at all. My therapists confirmed I carried out the experiment correctly (while chastising the ethics of it) and that it strongly suggested what they later confirmed - I neither ""chose the wrong groups"" nor ""acted inappropriately towards people""; people were simply acting irrationally towards me
 
&gt; And if this is your attitude, I can't help. I'm sorry.

You never *could* help, it was never your *intention* to help, and I""m too smart to *ask* people - the same people who have spent my life *hurting me* - for help.

Your rejection of me is *your* fault. Quit justifying your prejudicial rejection of me by lying and saying something *I* did caused it. That is false; every therapist agrees AND states that this is classic gaslighting.

How I behave now has *NO RELATION* to how I behaved as a child - *even my last therapist was shocked at my change between pre-diagnosis and post-diagnosis.* *He* said I was like ""two different people"" and worried what that meant. **Stop blaming child-Cryosleep for Captain Cryosleep's behavior** unless you seriously believe that people were punishing me for what I *might* do - or what they *tried to manipulate me to do* in the future.

I did not *once* act maliciously during my childhood - which means **people were *obligated* not to act maliciously toward me!** I did everything correct to not receive malice - ***and they delivered it anyway.*** If they're *already* being malicious to me after I've behaved *correctly*, changing that behavior isn't going to be any more correct, and won't stop their malice. They chose to be malicious *before* I acted, not *because* how I acted.

And *no one* ever deviated from that behavior.

If you're happy and leading a life you feel is fulfilled then by all means don't work on your social skills. I see from another post that you have a girlfriend, so clearly you do have *some* social skills. 

I think your read on people with social skills is not as objective and fact based as you'd like. Sure some highly social people are all of those negative things, but it sounds like you've got an emotional response to these people - they're morally in the wrong because they 'use' people, they're 'dishonest', it's automatically 'disingenuous' etc. And that's fine, you can have an emotional response to those people, clearly you've had bad experiences within social groups and that's bound to make you dislike the idea. But that doesn't make it **true** that having good social skills does make someone disingenuous, you feel it does, but that isn't the same as it de facto being the case.

Similarly since you are inclined to be less social as part of your authentic self, it makes sense that you would view social people as being inauthentic. But the important thing is to remember that just because being social is inauthentic *for you* doesn't make it so for other people. I am automatically quite social, it's just who I am as a person, not talking to people and not wanting to chat with people and get to know them would be intensely inauthentic *for me*. The whole point of authenticity is to be true to yourself, and since everyone is different it makes sense that different people would have different levels of authentic social wants. 

Finally, I have no desire to posses the ability to 'survive without the help of others'. I like other people. I don't think there's anything wrong with relying on others or having others rely on you. You have made complete independence some sort of virtue that you imply as being just 'true'. When actually it is something you clearly value, but that is not the same as it being some sort of objective goal all people should work towards.

Tl:dr - You're entitled to your opinion about not wanting to be social, you do you. But you don't actually have an 'objective' standpoint of facts and logic as your writing suggests there are lots of emotional reasons why you view being social as bad and you assume somethings about your experiences to be objective facts when they're not.

I believe you can love someone who has hurt you. Even if you part ways, you can be thankful for the things you DID like about them. It's not black and white.

Being paid less doesn't make me care less about doing a good job. And if I choose to work for free, it's my choice, and I do the best I can spare for free.

I don't have a time limit on friendships or acquaintances. If I know you, then I know you forever, and if I want you at my party, you'll be invited.

I don't ever expect gifts. If someone thinks of me and gets me a small one, I'm grateful. But me wanting to brighten someone's day or surprising them with something nice comes from MY love of THEM. It is not conditional on THEIR love of ME.

If I like you then I like you, it's simple. Why would I care what you think of me in return? So I tend not to get along with people who expect a trade-off for everything. I don't do trades. I just live and let live.

This is because my mind is so complicated, that I have to know the other person well enough to be able to share my thoughts and ideas. 

I can talk about small petty things, but that's very draining for me, but I'd much rather talk about the deeper meanings in life and about the inner workings of someone.

I don't think you should feel like you ""need"" to be that type of person. 

Embrace being an introvert, because when the right people come along to hear what you have to say..... they'll be amazed.

I have people all the time say that I would be a good speaker. Which I don't disagree with as long as the topic is on something I'm passionate about.

Group socialising might not be your thing. If it isn't, then that's okay. The world wants you to feel inadequate for not being so, but don't worry about that.

Where I work, there are people I click with and people I don't. Many of them like the whole group chit chat thing, but I don't. Mainly because the topic of conversations aren't what I'm drawn to and also drain me mentally.

However, for the few that I enjoy talking to, we have amazing conversations for hours about deep crazy random topics.

I have a list of questions that I write in my phone, because i'll get the idea at some random point and if I don't write it down it's gone. 

Even stories about my life that I would like to share at some point, I have them written down. 

You also have to learn how to ask questions. 

The usual open ended questions are great:

Who's someone dead or alive you'd love to meet?

One of my favourite questions is ""why?""

This one usually follows a question before.

One of my friends refused to answer a simple question of mine because I always go so much deeper into the answer they give me with, why?

""I'm not going to tell you because you're going to ask me why.""

Learning to ask questions is a skill. You can ask lame boring questions that sound like you're interviewing the person, or you can ask ones that make them think and look internally.

Show up a tad early, watch for people going into the meeting room.  When you spot a few go in, head on in, walk in, walk up to people while asking, ""Hey is this the ____ club?""  or whatever.   

1) it's relevant
2) it's a completely common thing, throughout the semester, but especially at the start
3) EVERYONE ELSE WILL ALSO BE LOOKING TO MEET PEOPLE
4) you are helping THEM to meet YOU since #3 ^^ , which is nice of you.

Actually, #1-4 really applies throughout the college experience.

Also, go to class.  Chat up the people around you.  If you have trouble speaking with people, just keep in mind that even if the specific person you open a conversation with after/during/before class isn't up for more interaction, there WILL be other people in earshot who are and will be glad to see you reveal yourself as an approachable person.  Expect fair odds that someone will walk up to you after you've shown willingness/interest in talking.  

Good topics in the classroom setting: the assignments, ""has anyone done the reading"", ""is anyone else a _(your department)___ major? "" and ""anyone have _ mynextclass 101 _  later today?"" 

If you get any sort of response, see if folks will linger after class out in the hall and chat, or if people want to check out the student center between classes, or want to go find a shared class ahead of time (since everyone is new to campus, it's not a bad idea).  Just be mindful that even if you have time to keep talking, someone else may need to find their next class immediately.  Don't stress - you'll see all the same faces in that class' next session, right?  Easy.  Just part with a ""hey, it was great meeting you, but I gotta run to next class.  See you next time, ok?""  Easy.  ""Or, hey we should hang out sometime and explore the campus/town, but I have to run right now.  Do you want to meet up after class today and look around? ""

Swap numbers and text them WHEN you are actually heading towards a place at end of day.  Don't text throughout day unless they start it.  Or don't swap numbers, just say, ""hey, I'm going to head into town and explore later, after we get out of class.  Want to tag along?""   EVERYONE wants to learn the town.  But may have other plans.  Just keep in mind its not rejection if people got other stuff to do.  That's the flip side of college - the people you really want to connect with will be the ones who are good at finding things to do and then DOING them.  Get in on that.  Clubs, activities, study groups, and anything that gets you more involved with your academic department is gold.  Especially the latter.  Look at campus jobs relating to your department, or tell your advisor you'd like one.  Great networking opportunities, especially if you work it over the years and can get involved in research - which is very, very feasible for an interested, proactive undergrad.  Just showing interest would set you completely apart from most of your peers.  

Back to the more social part of socializing, the really good stuff is when you start a campus club around an interest of yours.  It's ridiculously easy, and you may need a few people to get it officially recognized, but you can usually recruit before its official by just going to the student life/activities office with a flyer for them to put up.  Put your name and an email (get one specifically for the club so you can ditch it if jerks decide to spam it or whatever) where interested people can inquire about meeting time/place, club focus, etc.  Met a LOT of great people at uni, and I'm a complete introvert.  If you don't get a lot of names but still want to make it official, fill out the paperwork as best you can.  We made my friends ferret club Treasurer, so its not like the people running these offices are terribly strict about membership requirements.  I think we counted the ferret as a non-student member of the local community.  Oh yeah, college clubs can usually have members from the local town/city that aren't students.  Just have to keep them below a certain percentage.  Check with your college about their particular membership rules if it comes up.

The great thing is that everyone is new to the college community, there is a constant influx of new people, meeting and forming connections is one of the main activities, and so going up to folks in class, at clubs, at events, at booths (clubs or organizations will sometimes have booths out in the main square or activities center for events and other stuff) is all totally normal.  Plenty of opportunities where people are basically just there to speak with you if you walk up.   You won't be interrupting or feeling like you're efforts to strike up conversation are socially inappropriate.

The other great thing is that these are friendships you will likely keep for life.   Good luck!",0

I'm not saying it's necessarily easy, but if you can find ways to *accurately* assess the actual downsides of bad outcomes, that would be a huge step towards confidence.

My girlfriend is someone who considers it critical what opinions people hold and so if I don't really agree with her then I have to spend time defending by believes . Thankfully she is very sweet enough to wait around for when my words ""click"" and that's spend by talking for atleast half an hour .

Ultimately I've found it that in an actual professional and career related situation it doesn't matter since most decisions are up to you. Your work is proof of your credibility. Sometimes it's best to talk less and smile back  when you get the occasional condescending . It unnerves people. You can simply let people know you disagree . Let them think you're unreasonable because arguing is often unnecessary and results speak for themselves. Being publicly thought of as smart is often stupid. You'll impress people not only for your hidden smarts but your capacity to listen even if it's forced. 

If when you feel the need to fight this issue then Carry around sources and notes for big talking points so they can talk for themselves and you don't have to (just make an opening statement and about them and go, here see this). Also an activity that you can calm your mind is so so so very essential for your ADHD. I couldn't advocate meditation quite enough.

It's like finding out a godly power you have had all this time but is just normal brain clarity when you know something xD. Nowadays I don't think it's a bad thing. Your ADHD makes the way you look at things unique . 

Also for those who aren't diagnosed, get it diagnosed early . Not in my country but I know in the US (since I studied) you get alot of concessions made for you that help you perform better in alot of environments.

Practice taking charge of simple situations. You have a group of friends that seem indecisive on where to eat? Instead of doing the whole ""I don't care, it's up to you thing"" make a decision right then and there. If it's shot down make another decision and through it out there.

I also usually only see her once a month. (Last summer I was seeing her around all the time, but she's since return to uni). So the social momentum is being derailed by long leaps of absence.

Last Thursday I entered the store and she was stacking customer baskets right at the entrance I entered from. She looked up to see who it was, and when she noticed me she looked down again...

Right now, you should also be focusing on your own life and not be concerned with how many people you surround yourself with.  There's more important things like family, career, a roof over your head, food, bills.  Move out of home (if you haven't already) and move into a share house to meet new people.

I agree with stinkyxxchickenfeet for the most part, especially the fact that in terms of confidence you were doing very well and she covers many of the reasons someone might ask if you're gay. But that wouldn't account for EVERY interaction, only maybe 50%. So I want to throw out this thought:

If you were being flirty and bringing the conversation to sex and getting slightly physical (but in a natural way, not creepy) and were **obviously communicating that you were attracted** There is no way a woman who was even slightly attracted to you would label you as gay or a friend.

Obviously everyone is different and this is just not 100% true in real life. Not everyone will see the signs you put out, even if you're REALLY obvious. Some women have insecurities that give them a blind eye to such things, as do some men. But the fact that you don't seem to be perceived as a man looking for a relationship EVERY TIME suggests to me you need to start expressing your sexuality a bit more. The top comment is one way to do this, but instead of working on using a line, try and see the feelings in the background. Start expressing how you feel by just doing the things you most feel like doing. If you're attracted, this might be to touch, this might be to want to bring the conversation to sex, whatever you feel in your body, just do it.

I invite you to not suppress them desires as much. If the thing you feel like doing is slightly inappropriate but probably fun, just do it. What's the worst that could happen? you get rejected. But you showed your sexuality, you expressed what you were really feeling, she didn't think you were gay and you now have a better idea of how and when to express that much. And if it does work (which it is very likely to) you'll feel really free because you're expressing yourself and feel more alive and confident than ever. If the girl is attracted, the combination of showing your desires and being so confident and free is more than enough to secure a date. As long as you ride it through for the rest of your conversation.

I'm not saying it's easy to express yourself (It's not, not at ALL), there is a lot of social conditioning as to how things should be done and trying to break out of that is really hard. A lot of it is that you're taught to be a ""nice"" guy, don't be too forward, pander to her whims etc. My invitation is to be an **honest** guy instead, live true to how you feel. You might get more emphatic rejections but when you find someone compatible (and there are many compatible people, trust me on that) you'll have some of the best times of your life. 

Just let it out

Hope this helps somewhat, even if it is poorly written. Please remember this is just my opinion so don't take it as truth, and good luck in your future attempts.

As you start to take more time in observing people and developing more of an understanding towards them, you’ll realize that most people are very similar.

They’re expectable, predictable, though it may take more time to decipher some. They either want your company, time, money, or connections… soon enough you will connect the dots, notice patterns in how and when they meet you.

My advice is to practice and maintain neutrality. This has helped me.
Learn to harness yourself in different situations. *Don’t be so suspicious of others, and don’t rely on them too much. That’s not a healthy mindset.*

Don’t make yourself too vulnerable, and don’t get too easily intimidated by peer pressure.

Be confident and know that you are in control of what others know about you, and what they can have from you. Do some self reflection and ask yourself why and how people would want to use you (if any). You are the one opening the door for them to enter your life.

Be open to others, courteous, kind, and generous… but don’t expect much from them. Don’t let people take your goodness as weakness. 
Don’t be bitter and reclusive either, have balance in your interactions. Internalize the best and worst case scenarios, and take people for what they are.

Pay attention, be aware, be smart, and you should be fine.
You will soon find the people worthy of your commitment, as almost everyone wants to be trusted too, and their reputation matters to them. They will prove to you their loyalty, or the opposite.

First, accept the compliments and just say thanks and move on. When asked how you do it, you can make a joke like watched a lot of Bill Nye growing up or good genes, my mom is brilliant. I'd do something like this versus any lies. People can smell them. 

When meeting people outside school, do what the kids at a lot of ivys do and say you go to school in Boston or Philadelphia. If people really care they will ask a follow up of what school? You can say something truthful that tries to be relatable - university of Pennsylvania- go fighting quakers! Or yes, I'm majoring in astrophysics, but still can't figure out how to program my TV to record The Voice (or some other TV show that you think is funny that you'd watch - Bachelor in paradise, Bones, the simpsons). Sure, I can discuss the structural integrity of a bridge, but I can't seem to get my dog to listen to me explain it. With correcting the professor, I think you did fine, I'd stick to making it about you - 'I want to make sure I understand the process, do you mind explaining .....' or can go self deprecating with 'I may need coffee, I'm not seeing how we got from here to there.' 

For people in school who you may be ahead of, don't brush it off with Kahn academy or something. You studied and figured it out. If they don't understand something they will usually be impressed and move on, or say something self deprecating about how they didn't get get it- giving you an opening to say something like that was me in my Shakespeare class. Very rarely they might be hostile and call you rain man or something. If they go there, they are showing you who they are - being kind of a dick - so I call them on it: 'this where you wanna be when Jesus come back?' Or '[insert name] Jeff, you've changed' (quotes from Joe dirt and jay mohr to give credit where due). Usually they will be taken aback for being called out and everyone can move on. It's your call, but once someone does something like this, you can decide if you want them in your life anymore and limit interaction moving forward. 

I too had friends and family that helped me stay grounded and the things I learned along the way are take a compliment with a thank you. Don't lie. When meeting new people, try to make your academic achievements relatable by sharing something funny about your school or major - people who can be intimidated by your achievements are because they don't know how to relate to your world, so tell them the truth in a way that it gives them an opening to relate to you - sports, tv, movies, pets, video games, etc. 

You teach people how to treat you. If you are nothing but a list of academic achievements, then it's hard to relate. If you are brilliant but still struggle to open a can of pickles or always lose your keys, you're relatable. It's okay to be honest about who you are - because there is something truly awesome about everyone - just make sure you're sharing your humanity as well as your achievements. ",1

At one point you said ...""go on discord where it's safe"" - why is it safe on discord? What's the difference between being sober or inebriated in front of your pc talking to friends and/or strangers on discord, as opposed to being around friends/strangers at an event in real life?

One of my biggest obstacles was being able to spend time with friends or family without booze or drugs. The idea of literally sitting in the same room with a bunch of people for several hours watching tv and talking about stuff would make me feel extremely anxious and uncomfortable. Or worse, if I knew I didn't have any booze or drugs and I was going to see others who did, my anxiety would rise.  For years I ignored the why. But once I asked myself why this seems to be such an issue, and used Emotional Awareness techniques to break down what made me feel this way a lot of the anxiety disappeared.

Then I'd put it to a hypothesis by making projections of what would happen if I went to a friends place and drank water, coffee or tea, and saying no to a beer when offered.  It's also important, certainly at the beginning, to put yourself in a place where you can leave anytime you want to mitigate the pressure.

It will take several attempts at doing these open-ended ""experiments"" but if you're as honest as you can with your analysis of what you are experiencing in these moments you'll gain more mental maturity, and it'll be easier to recognise when there is something external affecting you as opposed to your mind trying to defend itself due to social fear.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

It's great you're feeling inspired to be more sociable. Definitely do it! This is half the battle. But without a strong emotional maturity baseline it's hard to shake the anxieties that bubble up since social anxiety is linked to emotions you internalise and create, rather than emotions in you created by those around you.

Learn the concepts of Emotional Intelligence and their toolsets. This will aid you in recognising the symptoms of internalised social anxiety and their effects on you. Do this by doing escalating social experiments where you make predictions of what will happen at an event, and comparing with how it actually went and how others actually reacted to you, instead of how you thought they would react to you.",1

Check out some improv (classes/books/YouTube), a big part of improv is this idea of saying ""Yes and..."". Fully accept what the person said and roll with it.

Sometimes we don't know where to look"", ""Just remember"", ""So genuinely show you are interested""]","Guideline assumption: Everyone is interesting.

The question you're asking in my experience is the rational start to begin finding better ways to make connections. Like learning how to walk or toss a ball, the desire is there while the skill is missing.

Walking takes practice to strengthen the muscle and changes in mindset  (mostly moving work to being unconscious) as the muscles come in, so does conversation. The first change you might find is your question comes from an odd point of focus. It's like asking ""how do I keep myself standing up without strength?"" The answer is you cannot, you will fall but to get strong enough to stand you'll fall as a natural path to gain strength. Very much the model of ""Fake it till you become it.""

So here's my two cents. Most people will tell you the actions you'll make, ""focus on key words, build a statement and a question from them, ask questions."" They are the practice, the workout, the regimen.

I'll answer your question straight. ""How do I sustain a conversation without having a common interest?"" You do not, will not sustain it without *interest*. Interest is what keeps a conversation alive.

There are two sides on a conversation, sometimes the roles flip but at any given point there is a listener and a speaker. A speaker does exactly what you think, they speak. You know how to be a speaker. If someone comes up to you and asks about something you love, you will gush, singing its praises and complexity. You have deep knowledge on what you love, if not details of how it works or what it is then in details of how it feels, your experiences, how it changes your life. Speaking is easy, when not crippled by anxiety.

So... is listening easy? It's a problem that comes up with what listening implies, it sounds like the role of listener is ""hearing"" someone. You do hear someone when listening, you do understand someone when listening but that is not what you do specifically when being a listener. You provide *interest* when conversing as a listener. You *are* interested. Remember times when talking with someone was easy, you knew enough about them, their day, their hobbies to be interested in them. So asking questions was a natural extension of your interest in their well-being, their day, their hobby.

So back to the guideline, everyone is interesting. If you want a conversation to stay rolling, you must communicate your interest. The passion, that powerful emotion of being interested is what makes a conversation move, live, and thrive.

So if you're going up to a person to be friends you do have a common interest. Them. That's what the conversation is always about, the speaker. As a listener you're only job is to convey how much you want to listen, how valuable each moment shared is going to be.

If you were brash, it would boil down to:
""You are interesting. Why?"" because you don't know why they're interesting yet. Is it their friend's circle, what they do, how attractive they are, their body language? If they were boring you wouldn't want to talk with them, the interaction would be worthless to you.

So with that in mind, rather than focusing on what to say at each juncture, juggling sentences like a wordsmith, instead focus on your motivation. That inquisitive fire, that thing that wants you to be friends with them. That thing that makes them interesting to you, figure out what that thing is, be honest with yourself. ""Why are they interesting?"" If you dig, dig, and dig and can't find it. Sometimes we don't know where to look but the more conversations you have the better you'll learn what interests you in a person.

Just remember you can love a hobby, you might love DOTA 2 or League of Legends, you might be a fan of anime and not know it. So if you want to find out, a person already in the hobby is more ready to show you the way even if it's just a point in the direction instead of a hand hold down the road. Are their hobbies what you really want to talk about? Or is it because they're doing it, how they interact with the hobby that's interesting? If you go in with the intent to be friends, then you're asking ""why is this person interesting enough to be around them, why is this person fun?"" If you find out why, then you've found out why they are friend material. In return they get to find out what in you is interesting to them.

In closing, everyone has a common interest, themselves. You can talk about yourself forever, so can they. People love to talk about themselves. So genuinely show you are interested and open them up as a speaker. Remember a child may know nothing about an object or subject other than furiously pointing at it but they are intensely interested in what it is. When you know absolutely nothing about something you start at the bottom. Just keep that passion burning.",1
soc_182641,778,evaluativist,high,high,none,"The writer presents their advice as conclusions drawn from extensive personal experience ('I've learned some painful lessons along the way') and provides detailed reasoning for their claims.

I've been ""me"" and freely vulnerable for a very long time and I've learned some painful lessons along the way.  
  
Big thing, you gotta know who to trust.  Being vulnerable means you're giving the other person everything they need to destroy you emotionally and socially.  A friend is going to take that information and use it to give you very potent help.  An asshole is going to use it to get one up on you at an opportune time.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**So how do you know who to trust and who to distrust?**  
  
Well, **you have to figure out what they value in life.**  What motivates them to go through life.  What topics do they frequently bring up?  What do they get excited about?  What are they embarrassed about?  What do they hate?  What kind of influences do they put into their lives?  How do they handle tests and struggles?  How do they treat people of obvious lower status?  What do they do with power?  
  
The big categories I can think of right now are Image-driven people, Love-driven, Laziness-driven, People-pleasers, Complainers/victims, Explorers (growth-oriented), and selfish greedy motherfuckers.  
  
**Find people driven by love, growth, and exploration.**  In my experience, they are going to be who you can trust the most.  They are going to be the most honest with you.  They are going to take care of your well-being the best, and they're going to do the most with your gifts that you give them.  They are going to be the most supportive people in your life, and they're going to help you the most when you're down.  
  
A good trick to find out the most about someone, is to **give them complete fuckin power over you and just see what the fuck they do with it.**  Like, ask them about something you're really bad at.  Or, my personal favorite, ask them about something you know a lot about and see if they spew bullshit or not.  (an ""oh, I don't know"" will award them insta-friend status).  And if they lord over you or shit on you, then fuck them, they get *no* mercy when the group finds out I'm actually a boss hahaha.  But if they're super sweet and help you, then they're good friends.  
  
**And find people that have their own shit going on outside of you.**  Like, be extremely cautious with someone who has nothing going on in their lives and they seem to always leech off your life.  They have caused the most *drama* and *bullshit* in my life because they just don't take care of themselves and they allow any random bullshit into their lives.  They'll be a lot fun to party with, but they will completely wreck your life if you're too attached to them.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**And how do you be you in a new social situation when there could potentially be a snake there?**  
  
Basically, be comfortable having your weaknesses and insecurities out in the open, so no one can hurt you socially or emotionally.  Be ok with your weaknesses.  Either accept them and be the first to admit them, or start working on improving them and take pride in it.  I've turned the tables on a few assholes (""friends"" HAHAHA) in group settings when they tried to embarrass me about something I told them in confidence, and then I just **owned** it and made them look like *assholes*, and then retook my dominance.  Fuck those guys man.  But they're fucking everywhere and they hide really well, so you just gotta be prepared to have all your dirty laundry out in the open.  
  
And always be honest, but don't *fucking* tell everyone everything about you right off the bat.  Make them *earn* your trust.  Slowly build intimacy and see how they react to different things.  If they fail a test, back off and run away for a bit (conversationally).  You can always retest them later and see if they're worthy of your gifts.  But if they keep failing the saaaame test (like shitting on another person, or complaining about some petty bullshit, or lying to your face to try to gain your approval), then just set your boundary of intimacy right there and never go past it with them.  Now yall are friends and they just think you're a quiet guy.  When really, you just don't trust them.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
Ok man, that's all I got.  Good luck!  Feel free to ask more questions.  And I guess as a closing line, ""you attract what you *are*, not what you *want*"".  So become who you want to be friends with, and you'll naturally attract them into your life. (if that makes sense  hahaha)",1

So that’s why the in person thing helps. Read her body language. Is she leaning away from you? Are her feet turned away? If so she’s probably not interested soooo drop. Trust your gut. You will get better with practice at gaging if girls are interested.

As far as talking to them. Ask people questions about themselves they love it! Actually listen to their answers people can tell if ur really listening. If it seems fitting, interject with any relative comments or stories. Practice having answers for the questions you ask bc they might ask them in return. Practice having answers to standard questions. When in doubt don’t ramble ( I hate when I do this) And try to not over share unless they seem to really open up as well. 

Everything I’ve said can apply to making friends as well! It’s all about practice! It’s a numbers game really. If u talk to 1 new person the odds are very slim that y’all will click and make great friends. If u talk to 100 new people the odds are one of y’all will click!

Work on / worry about self improvement. Working out is a huge self confidence boost (I know that’s true for me). What else will help? What else are you insecure about? Try a basic skin care routine. Try meditating. Try eating better. Stay on top of your school work. Try new hobbies. Whatever you think. Journaling really helps as well making this stuff clear to you. 

Also don’t leave unless you have your heart set. If u think the grass is greener it’s prob no. I’ve traveled quite a bit to several countries and people r the fucking same everywhere. Same shit different toilet. 

Sorry if this is chaotic or rambley but I just really wanted to help. Good luck!",1

Something I've found in my own life is that the number of friends I have and the loneliness I feel tend to go up and down a lot. If I have a job where I like the people around me, or if I was in school in a class where everyone interacted a lot, I made friends. Sometimes the friends gradually fade away and don't get replaced quickly. The downs are really hard, but I do believe that circumstances will always change, especially if I'm like ""I hate how things are and I need to make some changes.""

Sometimes when I don't like how lonely I feel, I try to take a good hard look at what *I'm* doing. Am I being open and friendly, or reserved? Am I listening enough? Am I even interested in the people around me? Do I like them? If I'm in a phase of depression, I'm probably reserved, bitter, sad, negative, and very down on myself. I resent other people for their happiness. If you find yourself feeling that way, therapy is really helpful. Books about depression might also be helpful.

There's a great old book by Dale Carnegie: ""How to Win Friends and Influence People."" It challenges the reader to change their social approach to other people.

Self love is something that eludes me too. I struggle with this a lot, so I'm not going to tell you to snap out of it and learn to love yourself because your life will change blah blah blah. Humans are highly social, communal animals and I really do think we need other people. I would agree with the other posters that you should try, and keep trying, to put yourself out there. Not just with girls, but try to find your people. Do you like video games? Join a club or a meetup where people like video games. Stuff like that.

Everyone is different, but the fact is we can't live without some form of human/social attention, a feeling of being needed and wanted by others. The fact that it bothers you to describe it as ""giving up"" or the use of depressive language shows how much you want it not to be the case of destiny.

It's not.

It's a case of probability and what you do to yourself. I don't know you so I can't/wouldn't judge you, I don't know what's going on in your life, but:

Are you sure you're going outside your comfort zone?

 When you make these attempts to get to know people are you reserved in trying/learning new things? While you do want to make friends, are you willing to try new things or go the extra mile with questions?

For example I had class with this girl and I started up a convo, I said ""hey how's it going?"" 

She said great, I mention something about the class in a good spirit and I say, ""my names RazzyTaz"" she tells me her name, we talk and I ask about basic things like why are you in this class? What do you do? 

She told me she runs a start up Tea company, but I don't usually drink tea or coffee, but still I keep interest by saying,

 ""Oh you run a tea company with your sister that's cool! I'm not much of a tea drinker, but I've never really had any good tea (which was true). What do you enjoy? She goes on and she mentions how she's trying a new church sunday, that catches my ear (listening is half the battle) and I ask"" are you an avid church goer?"", she says yeah, she had been going all her life (it's something important to her). I consider myself christian, but I don't go to church and it's not something I would want to go to. I tell her ""That's cool, I consider myself Christian,  but I haven't been to church since elementary school"", and she invites me to go to church with her for easter. 

Here is where people diverge, they either say no, because they either might have something important (like work etc.) Which is understandable, or they don't want to go, because it's too far out their comfort zone/interest.

This was FAR outside my comfort zone. I may be christian, but I'm not a go to church, bible reading one.

But I said yes, because it shows that even though I dont have much of an interest in what you do I'm willing and trying to get to know you on a more than basic chat level. We exchanged numbers, I went, I got to meet her older sister, had a great time, met the pastor (who's now here boyfriend lol), she invited me to meet and have easter dinner with her fam.

Just last week we hung out and went bowling with plans to do other things in the future along with texting.

We didn't have much in common, but even though that was the case I found a way for us to share a common ground and build a frienship. It doesn't mean I have to go to church with her from now on, or anything like that, but it's something I'm willing to do, because being open to new things is the best thing about life for me.

I consider myself a intro-extrovert. I was the guy who gave up making friends after freshman year, because I moved away to a new city and was fat and afraid of my appearance, and became a depressed, filthy, smelly, dirty roomed mess who was tired all the time and had random fits of anger and sadness and didn't know why.

It was because I was mad and sad at myself for losing myself to obesity and no social life. I wanted to be an extrovert, that was always me, I wanted to be the althletic guy people wanted to talk to and there was no reason why that couldnt be other than me being afraid to grow up.

I'm out of HS I'm no longer depressed, and I'm striving to become a better person and that starts with communication and friendship for me.

Even having online friends is a good thing I had those too and those count as friends in my book. ",1

Personally I think you're coming at this the wrong way. You're trying to identify yourself as a person based on your disease. ""this constant debate of whether to be normal vs. abnormal"", what is ""normal""? Basically I think that you should work on yourself and try to become better at it but realizing that the point you're at every day is good enough, but never good enough not to improve at. Another thing is that people with aspbergers generally have a hard time reading social situations and people judging them, this can be seen both as a blessing and as a curse. It can be a curse because it means you might be socially uncalibrated but it can also mean that you don't care about peoples opinions of you which can be great. The CEO of the biggest pick-up companies in the world probably has some sort of mild aspbergers and autism which he said was a big problem for him in the beginning of him learning pick-up but it also helped because he never cared what people thought of him so he'd just keep going until eventually he learned the stuff and he is one of the most confident and social people you'd ever see.

Basically, the gist is that I don't think it's healthy to try and label yourself as one thing or another, especially when you haven't actually been diagnosed. I'd say that it's up to others to label you by what they think of you (funny, boring, awkward, nice, etc.) and it's up to you to be the best you can be and not really care what labels they'd put on you. Back when I was a lot less confident I'd always try to include everyone and try and make people like me, paradoxically though this worked against me as I'd never stand up for what I really believed or even pitch into a debate if I didn't think everyone would agree with me. What this led to was people getting a feeling of me not being genuine and not participating in a discussion, I also became sort of a pushover where I'd never have any opinions on things. I realized that it's better to share your honest opinions and thoughts and have 50% think you're a GREAT person and 50% think you're dumb than to have 100% think you're just the average Joe or Jane and treating you as such. Because the 50% that do like you are going to absolutely love you and you'll have great friendships and the other 50% are going to be people that you would've never been able to connect with on a deeper level due to having a large difference in beliefs and opinions.

Try putting yourself in uncomfortable situations. Join a new club or activity where you know a few or no people.  The more you get uncomfortable, the more comfortable you'll be being uncomfortable. (Does that make sense?)

Let yourself be awkward, learn from it and try to improve next time.  Good luck! And you'll find friends in college through sitting next to classmates!  Think of highschool as a test run since you'll never see anyone but friends from there again.  Also, it's up to you to keep in touch with friends just as much as them. 

I keep in touch with a friend who moved away as well as a few online friends.  Just a simple ""Hey, we have't talked in awhile! What's up?"" will suffice. Or simple ""Yo, we haven't hung out in awhile! Want to hang out today?"" will keep you guys in contact.

If they don't respond, don't beat yourself up.  They're busy, try again the bext day or so.

Basically, what I'm trying to say is don't be embarrassed about your resolution! Friends support each other, everyone is a little awkward in the social setting, but people figure it out by making mistakes and improving!

My first piece of advice is to accept your friendship has ended. This is very important for many reasons, the biggest being: Accepting her words is the most respectful thing you can do. If you have not already, I would type out a short but thoughtful goodbye message for your closure and hers. Something like ""I am sorry I crossed a boundary, and I will continue working on myself. I will always treasure our friendship, but I respect your decision. Take care."" And then you need to make the effort to leave her alone, she might not reply and you need to make peace with that. 

If she wants to rekindle things in the future, she will reach out to you. So you need to give her space, and leave her alone. 

This is also important for you. A chapter is ending, and it is painful. But holding out hope that if you just explain one more time that she'll come around is not good for you. You cannot process and move forward from this pain without accepting what has happened. 

There's other lessons to be learned here, since it sounds like the friendship had gotten rather unhealthy. It sounds like you made some absolutely great steps toward improving yourself and your circumstances, but did not make steps in being less dependent on her friendship specifically.

It sounds like it put a lot of pressure on her to be your emotional support, and perhaps even got a bit possessive. Which is, to me anyway, most likely why in her eyes, not enough has changed. 

So I would say as you begin to process this loss, you'll also want to work on how you treat those you treasure. You cannot pour from an empty cup. You need to take care of yourself so you can be there to pour for them. But you also need to give them time to care for themselves so they can pour for you.",1

My close family and friends have this perception of me that I'm shy, anti-social and introverted. However, I actually crave going outdoors, having fun and socializing with people. Its my social anxiety that keeps me from doing those things. And my social anxiety is slowly getting better and the more it is, the more I feel the urge to go to parties and act differently. However, its hard to come out of the shell that other people have placed me in, because I fear their judgement or their accusations of why I am suddenly acting different.

I have had friends where we would talk everyday to the point we had about 10x the conversation together than with anyone else.

I've got people I still see at parties that I went to school with.

I have a friend group of people I used to share a hobby with (and sometimes do)

I am still friends with my mate I met in kindergarten and we are now on 30 years of friendship but due to his hours with work and distance we rarely see each other. 

I have other mates I would consider close but whom I never see. Mates who I know I could turn to if I needed help and if they needed me. 

After our baby was born though it gets increasingly harder to find any time for yourself and doing things with your friends. Catching up on social media is about as good as it gets lately but it works fine for me.

Furthermore, cold approach isn’t a bad thing. It depends on how you do it. So even if you’re shy, it’s a good way to meet women (or men or others). And you’re right, it’s extremely hard to know whether someone is interested or not… that’s why you need to approach them and show interest by asking them out or for numbers etc.

Again all of this isn’t bad, but you need to do it the right way. That means being honest about your intentions, for example by stating that you approached her because you found her attractive. That also means accepting any outcome. So if she says she has a boyfriend or isn’t ready to date rn or gives you a cold “no thank you” or gets mad at you for some reason or simply walks away from you without even giving an answer… you need to accept that answer and move on.

Something like that would have sent the message in a better way than what you did. Sending something like what you did is not having yourself respected, it is called Emotional Blackmailing.

The only difference is that most people learn from them. You admit that you do not learn from the mistakes you make. Are these little mistakes, or big bloopers? Are your mistakes hurting the person that you supposedly love? From your post, it appears your mistakes are causing some damage. And that is dangerous. When you decide to do something that will be a mistake, do you stop to think of the possible consequences to yourself? Do you stop and think how your actions (behaviors) have the potential to affect others? This is where you go off the rail because of your poor choices. 
Now, we want you to think about the last mistake that you made. Think of what it was and then think about how it made you appear to others around you. Now, think about how the mistake you made affected the people that are the closest to you. Write these things down so that you can look at it all when you are finished. Now don't beat yourself up over it, but THINK about it as we laid it out. Take some time and do it now. 
Looking back over the example, how did your decision to go ahead with the mistake make you appear to others? Also, how many people did your poor choice affect in some way? And, how did it affect the people that are closest to you? How does that make you feel knowing this? Now, again looking back, try to think of the moment that you decided to do that one thing that was a mistake. What if you had taken a minute, a moment, a millisecond to CONSIDER  your choice and how that choice would have affected people close to you and also how you would appear to others as you stepped through that poor choice? 
What is important here is that we must take the time to consider HOW our mistakes affect our friends, our family, and ourselves. Sometimes people do not take the time to consider situations properly. This is where the problems come into play. We must place ourselves in a position to be able to consider the consequences of our behaviors and choices and be able to step away quickly in order to protect ourselves from harm. Believe it or not, the brain is actually set up to avoid danger and make us run from it in order to protect ourselves. And protect the people we love and care about from emotional stress and embarassment. It's not as hard as you may think. The secret is to be able to recognize danger early and act quickly to get away from that danger. Perhaps you are not taking the time to recognize potential danger. That is something you must begin to do everyday. Be on watch for danger. 
How can you do that? Easy. Dump the toxic people from your life - which you have already chosen #1 over #2 - and THINK  about each choice that you make and act accordingly, which means CONSIDER how your choices will affect your friends, your family and yourself. 
We know this is a lot to take in, but life is hard. And life tortures us enough, so why must we do it to each other and ourselves? 
And hang in there, because you are going to do well. You already know there is a problem and that is the first and most difficult step to take. You are already a winner. Hey, deep down inside you is greatness just waiting to get out. Give yourself permission to do just that. We have faith in you.

You're 100% right in that you won't speak to the vast majority of anyone you interact with at your highschool after graduation, so you could if you want take this as a great opportunity to get out of your comfort zone and talk to people, but if you don't want to that's entirely okay!

Find an interest and join a discord group about it, chat in there to build up your skills over text and occasionally hop into voice chats with others.  


As an adult I put the time in to socializing (mainly through just chatting to coworkers 40 hours a week) and now it's a breeze to me. There are people much younger than me who are fantastic at making conversation and building relationships, but that's only because they decided to personally make that a priority over other things (like in your case, academics). Don't feel the need to push yourself in any direction that makes you too uncomfortable, the fact that you're even asking about this means you're in a good spot to be growing plenty as a person over the next few years. I'd personally recommend popping out of your comfort zone just once every few weeks or so to test the waters and work on building that skill a tad, but that's up to you and in the long run it won't make much of a difference as your social skills will skyrocket immediately once you finish gradeschool.",1

You don't have to be super social.  If I'm kind of slacking off or I'm a bit moody one day, it's not too big of a deal as long as it's not a routine.

When you're at a new job, you don't have to immediately open up to everybody.  Be pleasant, smile, do your job, and your co-workers will slowly open up to you.  Unless your boss is an asshole or you really fucked up, you probably wont get yelled at.  If you do get reprimanded or criticized though, 9 times out of 10, it's best to just apologize, take responsibility, avoid excuses, and say it won't happen again.  Having a difficult co-worker though can be a tough situation but that varies from case to case.  

Most office environments aren't like high school (thank god).  People have more important things to do with their time and they have their own job responsibilities, families, kids, social lives, and mortgages, etc. to worry about to be gossiping about your quirks.

It's always nervewrecking to have a new job but I'd worry about the things you can control first, namely your new job performance.  Even though the new position sounds more competitive and younger, I think you'll find your co-workers will probably be similar to your old job once you get settled in.

If you do want to get closer to your co-workers, ask the older people about their kids.  Maybe go with your younger co-workers to happy hour sometime, which is always fun.  Ask about plans for the weekends, vacations, sports, weather, work even, etc. and eventually you'll find some common ground.

&amp;#x200B;

1. You don't remember things that you do not need. Probably you are not invested in those shows, books or movies; no big deal. For classes it's actually the same; every skill or theory that you don't use often (e.g. in your job) will eventually fade. Of course, everyone learns differently; it could be also that you're used a method of learning that doesn't suit you. Try change it up if you wanna explore new results. 
2. Again, this is most likely part of your charcter rather than dumbness. I'm the kind of person that often make some crazy connection between a topic and another, but that *hasn't* to be all people. 
3. You said you **are** curious, so there is really no problem here. You should be curious for your own sake, on the topics you like, not just to ""bring up factoids"" later. If people want factoids, the can go over buzzfeed.  The question part is just about the art of conversation.
4. Again, nothing wrong there. The time is yours, it's up to you how to spend it. More on this later\*
5. It's better to have strong opinions after having learned strong facts on a certain argument. Guess what? Most people have strong opinions first, then try to justify them in any way. If you want to get your opinion on something, just research it. The opinion will form over time. Nevermind not having an opinion now - *being open to change and cultivate your own* could be a good attitude.
6. Again, character. Not everyone is the witty type.

&amp;#x200B;

You totally fit in the social anxiety definition, in my honest, not-a-therapist opinion. The simple fact that you worry about your supposed inability to carry a conversation **will stop you from having a good one.** How can you read a room, enjoy the moment, and come up with interesting topics if your mind is stressing about your insecurity?

&amp;#x200B;

I'll add something more on point 4. It's fine to be content, but I find useful to distinguish between activities:

1. things that I like doing
2. things that I like doing, which are also useful, healthy, and aimed to a target
3. things that I don't like doing, but I must

You'll probably have 1 and 3 regardless of what you do. And again, it's perfectly fine browsing your smartphone while on the couch in your leisure time. But maybe there are also some things you'd like, which will require a little effort, but that can build into something more in time. If you'd like being more knowledgeable, read a book on a topic you'd like. Watch some youtube videos on the matter. Of course, sometimes it's easier to relax, but there are nice things that require effort (and get better the more effort you put in them).",1

Forget talking about school. Its usually a no way street and talking about it falls under social obligation. She's had that conversation dozens of times already.

As to what to talk about. Ask questions initially to start the conversational momentum. Awkward silence is a example of no momentum. Questions will be your push to get the conversational momentum going.   

What question do you ask? You thinks she's cute right, ask about her. What are her interest? Does she have sisters? Are they close? does she travel? Does she play video games? Why the hell don't you play video games? pokemon even?  Whatever you wanna know or would interest you.  You CAN cater these question to typically thing that would interest girls like: to spark the interest initially but if you can't follow up its a dead end.    

Next Key is to LISTEN, when you ask a question you listen, she's going to give you a bunch of potential topics or non topics to  follow up on.  Don't ask the obvious question.  For example. if you ask if she has a sister and its a yes. Don't ask her How old is she, or the next socially obligated question. Instead you can, maybe, assume she's a older sister, that she has big sister vibe.  Then that can move to a discussion about her personality habits and thought, self perception, experience as big sister, etc. See how a conversation can evolve quickly.  Stay positive, no therapy type threads.

Though this won't make her hot for you, The goal here is be a curious fun cool chill guy. Depending on how old you are that can be enough for her to be hot for you.

Now to to prepare.  Try this exercise.  If you have a close friend thats trustworthy and open to you improving you conversational skill.  Try word association: its where one person says on world, topic or phrase. and then the other talks about it for 2 mins. Go beyond just describing the thing. For example. Say they say chocolate. This can remind you of Christmas, and then you talk about you fav christmas memory. The idea is get use to talking and and creating new conversational threads.

You fine tune once you get this down, learn to steer conversation based on the feedback from the other person.
Learn Intuitively what to start with and where to go. You only get getter the more you do it. Talk to everyone, small talk with cashiers, random ppl, you family, friends, dog, call up your old cousins, your neighbour. 

DO NOT TELL your friends that you like her. At least not just yet. Unless you really trust her to help you and that you're confident she can help in the right way.  Otherwise, you may be creating a situation outta your control. Telling your friend assumes that your making her your pseudo wing girl.  And unless she gets it and wants to help you properly, then don't. Also this means that the process of her digging you is up to you. and if you do create a situation that outta your control then maybe via fate, you do end up dating. However, Ill tell you, leaving things to fate sucks, make you own luck.

Step one - if you can't talk about yourself in a humble and engaging manner, you're going to seriously struggle understanding other people.

* This is a classic case of Ask Culture meets Guess Culture. In some families, you grow up with the expectation that it's OK to ask for anything at all, but you gotta realize you might get no for an answer. This is Ask Culture.

* In Guess Culture, you avoid putting a request into words unless you're pretty sure the answer will be yes. Guess Culture depends on a tight net of shared expectations. A key skill is putting out delicate feelers. If you do this with enough subtlety, you won't even have to make the request directly; you'll get an offer. Even then, the offer may be genuine or pro forma; it takes yet more skill and delicacy to discern whether you should accept.

And no; It's late and my story would be very long, so I'll be short and elaborate if necessary tomorrow.

 I have gained social skills and change people's image's of me, however I didn't ""repair"" my relationships out of a personal choice (my friendships from early high school were actually friends of my girlfriend and that was an unhealthy relationship so after about a year and a half I found better friends). I went to a very small and unique high school that people had to apply for, and it was one of the few things I was passionate about, so I eventually started helping with recruiting events - it didn't start great, but it was okay and that gave me lots of good experience where the only thing I had to improve on was my social skills. This helped me a lot because my lack of social skills came from overprotective parents who left me very sheltered and unsure of myself, by using these events to boost my confidence I was able to practice socializing, and the most important thing is practice.

Over four years I went from getting physically sick before/after social events and eventually became more confident and practiced in my social skills, I never became a super popular guy or had more than one person I called a friend(strict definition of friend, I had about 20 acquaintances and 30 more peers), but as of this week (I graduate on Friday, and Saturday YAY) I can go from social group to social group and interact with all the students, still don't always want to be social, but I can and it no longer bothers me. I even managed to have long talks with my all of my ex's who used to make me very uncomfortable.

My advice to you, identify traits you like in social people and want to show more of in you - I'm not saying to change yourself, we all have a humorous side, or a caring side, but we don't always practice showing these parts of ourselves or know how to. Try it, I always wished to be funnier, and to not be afraid to stand up for myself, so I started making more jokes in everyday conversation and slowly became more assertive- and it worked, most of the time people laughed or didn't question me and I felt good about it. And as of this year I've been much less of a pushover, the hardest person to accept that was my ex, of course, but for the first time I believe she respects me for me.

My suggestion to you is just to find a way to relax and have fun while socializing. Be in the moment, really listen to other people, experience emotions as they come and go. If you judge yourself then judge yourself and move on. If you're worried about school/work/anything just note it for later and move on. Don't dwell on one thought. It's a waste of mental energy.

Here is my strategy for making conversation, not sure if it will be helpful (it is structured like this because I do philosophy...) but I find it effective in my conversations.

It's possible to carry a conversation on almost any topic by following a general structure of questions, without needing to understand anything specific about a topic (though it helps). The keys are asking questions and communicating to the other person/people that you are interested-if you seem bored people will disconnect.


*  My first step is to think of general questions I can ask that are different enough from the cliches that people don't switch off. At a wedding reception tonight it was ""What are you looking forwards to about the rest of the year."" This gives the person an opportunity to talk about something that is significant to them, without restricting the scope of possible topics. eg. asking ""what do you do?"" requires the person to talk about their work, but they may hate it and try to avoid talking about it. Some people won't have an answer, but most will and now you have a topic that engages them.


*  Now without knowing what their answer will be you can pretty much plan your next question; all it has to do is invite them to elaborate on the topic. eg. ""Why are you looking forwards to that?"" I like this strategy because it takes some of the pressure off me to drive the conversation, I have now given the other person permission to be the main contributor.


*  As the conversation continues I need to become more specific with my questions, but I can still predict some of the structure to them. So here are some types of questions: - content: get them to explain the nuts and bolts of the topic. eg. if they have said Christmas ask them what Christmas looks like for them, do they have traditions. If the topic is holidays ask them if they have already made plans. etc... What we want is for them to educate us about something they are interested in.

*  Here are some themes you can use in thinking of questions:  
  *  *attachment*: what is their place in relation to the topic. We want to find out why they are interested, or involved, or merely why they want to talk about this. If they say football then we want to know what about football interests them. Do they play football? Are they just a spectator? Is it their kids that play football? If they say Reddit then we can ask whether they like to lurk or do they like to comment heaps? Are they a daily reader or sporadic.  
*  *emotions*: we want to find out their emotional connection to a topic. Is it something that makes them happy or excited, or is it infuriating to them. This gives us an insight into how a person thinks and what they value, things that are very helpful for forming long-term friendships. In general you don't ask direct questions like ""How does that make you feel?"" (which I think is a weird question), but rather ""What do you like about Christmas?"" or ""Can Christmas be a stressful time for you?""

*  *history*: not always that interesting but it gives us context to the topic. eg. ""Has your family always celebrated Christmas?"" or ""How did you find out about Reddit?""

The next step is the harder part, but isn't a requirement when making friends. You now want to start relating to what the person is talking about, this shows that you are engaged in the conversation and also provides them the opportunity to learn about you. There are lots of different ways to do this, especially to stay appropriate to the topic.

*  Broadly speaking you can connect by sharing similarities (what you have in common or can relate to), differences (what you are unfamiliar with or approach differently), or questions (what puzzles you about something, or something you want to know. Even better is to ask them their advice). These three are the methods of connecting, to which we have to add content:

*  attitude: connect with the way they feel about a topic. You can probably relate to someone's passion for a topic, even if it's nuclear physics, or sympathize with their frustration, even if it's over the colour of nail polish, because you have attitudes towards stuff to; so you are engaging with the attitude regardless of your interest in the content. eg. So you love Reddit because of the cool AMAs, I love reading those too. Which ones have been your favorites. Or ""I find people's stupidity frustrating, I don't know anything about nail polish but I often feel that big companies can lose touch with what their customers really want.""

*  result: relate to their success/failure in an area. eg. ""I've never had a high karma comment, what do you recon is the secret to a good comment?"" - your understanding: tell them whether you understand what they are talking about or not as a means to continue the conversation. If you do understand give them a summary and ask whether that is a fair representation of what they were saying. eg. So you like Christmas because it brings your whole family together. If you don't understand ask them to explain it a different way (eg. ELI5), give a summary, or highlight a specific point they made for more information about it.

*  how does it effect me: (not for all topics) get them to explain why you should care about the topic. eg. I'm not a Christian, so do you think I can get excited about Christmas as well?

**Edit** On account of the discussion generated I wanted to clarify a few points.

1) Yes, this method is not natural. Yes, it can make you sound like a robot. However, *people who are natural and good at conversation don't need this advice.* This advice is for the people who are frustrated by their failures, often directly through trying to be natural. So your comments are true, but miss the purpose and the audience for the advice (I'm not trying to sell a cancer cure to the healthy).

2)  Yes, natural is better, so lets try to be more natural in conversation. Like in the movie Yes Man, if you are to extreme with this advice it will cause problems. But, hopefully through using the advice it will make you more comfortable with having conversations. Then you will converse more, get better at it and progress towards being more natural. IMHO I think that this kind of structure can help that progression.

3)  I am a nerd, in some ways. I can be awkward, at times. I don't have as many conversations as I would like. I often find it hard to practice what I preach. But I have improved in conversation in many ways as a result of thinking through structures like this.

4)  Use what you want, tweak it, ignore it. Your choice. Will it work for you? Maybe... I hope so. Everything is about context, who you are talking to, where, when... The structure I have formulated tries to capture some of that in a coherent way, give advice general enough to be useful. Conversation is fluid in most regards, some understand that and are comfortable with it, to others it's a dark and intimidating space to enter-I'm just trying to shed some light.


I am truly thankful for all the responses, it's exciting. Also, there have been lots of other great advice posted by others that is worth checking out, very thought provoking and helpful. Here are some of the great comments (I'll  have missed some-sorry).

I'm a man in late 30s so I can give you some insights. You are overthinking this way too much.  
It's very simple, men pursue women, all the time. No questions asked, **subconsciously** we want all the women.   
That being said, we can of course be platonic however any friendship will always have the possibility of turning into a relationship if we sense that the woman is interested in us.

So with that knowledge , as a woman you should be aware of **not sending romantic signals his way,** if you want to remain friends that is. Simply, keep the conversations very casual, don't flirt at all, don't constantly call / text , etc. 

On the other hand, if you actually want him as a partner, then gently let ***him*** pursue you. Flirt a bit, show interest but certainly don't turn into a doormat. Men will (generally) lose interest if that happens (I \_know\_ this). 

Don't forget, he might still misinterpret things, so it's up to you to steer him in whatever direction you want this to go.

People typically like me when they first meet me. As they get to know me better, the majority tend to dislike me and the few who don't tend to become friends. I don't know how normal this is, but it's always been my situation. I think it's probably pretty normal to the process of making friends but I'm not sure.  


Anyway, I used to have a lot of social anxiety around this. I will tell you how I got over that but I don't know if this is good advice for everyone.   


First, the reason people tend to like me in the beginning is that I'm very private and I don't want attention, but I need something to say and some way to act when I'm in a situation in which I must interact with others. Because this does not come natural to me, I studied it very early on in high school. The solution is very simple actually. You focus on breathing and standing without fidgeting. You make decent eye contact. You ask the other person a lot of questions about themselves and you listen to them talk about themselves while nodding and saying things like ""wow that's interesting"" or whatever thing is appropriate to what they say. People love to talk about themselves and they like people who let them talk about themselves. You do not think about how you come across at all and you do not attempt to show yourself in any way. Just ask questions and listen to them. If they ask questions about you, you keep it simple and impersonal without being evasive. I have a typical ""gist"" that I give about my life (where I live, what I do, etc) and I give no details about myself beyond that. When there is a lull in the conversation or you feel the other person might not wish to continue talking about themselves, then you shift the conversation to the topic that brought you together in the first place (like if it's a work situation then what the work is, if it's a hobby situation, then the activity you are doing together, if it's a social situation or a chance meeting in public then usually the immediate setting works.)  


These tips will get you through basically any social, hobby or work interaction in a way that makes people like you in an informal and casual way. If you are actually seeking friendship or you need to have a real in depth conversation beyond that, then you move on to number two.  


Second- you will never see most people you meet again. No big deal. You have to work on yourself not caring about that. If you are in a scenario in which you do see the person again, you have to decide if you like them enough or if you are compatible with them enough to actually pursue a real friendship. I've found that if I'm really honest about this, then I only actually like most people to the extent that we do things together or have a shared interest. I don't really want to know them as an intimate friend. Therefore, I just do the steps listed up in number one again but in more depth. Ask them more about themselves, take an interest in their lives, but mostly I focus on the thing we are doing together. Hobbies or work usually. Most people will ask you questions about yourself too, and if you keep your answers brief and don't go into too much detail, you will fall into an easy rhythm and the friendship is mostly focused on whatever common interest you have. This is also a good way to avoid drama and burn out.  


Every once and a while, someone like this will turn out to be someone I really genuinely like, and then I will slowly start to open up to them and be more natural around them. I'm old enough that I can tell you with certainty that around the 6-8 month mark, every single person I get to know like this is suddenly surprised by something I do which seems really intense to them. The intensity of my opinions about things or else the fact that I do things which are outlier behaviors (apparently) or the intensity of my emotions, whatever. It's always fascinating to me because I will tell people anecdotes before then about things that have happened in the past and they laugh and tell me I'm funny and that they like my attitude and sense of humor, but then when they are in a scenario in which that is put into action for the first time, they are always surprised. At this point, most people stop hanging out with me. This used to really bother me and I'd lay awake at night thinking through the scenario over and over again trying to figure out what I did wrong and how to handle it better. But then around my mid 20s I just realized that the friends I did have were very good solid friendships with lots of reciprocation and trust, so I decided I'd rather have a handful of those than a big social group. Since then, I've just accepted that most people won't like me as much as they get to know me and I'm more selective about who I let get that close and likewise I expect that many will not like me after that 6-8 month mark. The ones who do become intimate lifelong friends.  


In short- number one gets me through casual interactions which are most of them, number two gets me to real friendship though it is often awkward and I accept some level of rejection. Having this strategy and making peace with the rejection have solved the anxiety problem with regards to talking to people.

It first started in Year 8 (I was around 12 years old), and it was because I have ginger hair and was a little ""podgy"". It wasn't anything serious at first, but like yourself, it got real annoying real fast. Throwing pens and rubbers across the class at me, scribing over my notes, publicly shaming me with lies etc. (for some reason they decided to spread a rumour that I fucking STOLE a 15p packet of crisps)

Now I had my ""group"" of friends, wasn't really a group was more like 4 people. I just stuck with them, and they did nothing. They would just completely ignore me when the bullies were doing their thing, whether that be public humiliation or physical abuse.

I had never been bullied before, or realised that I was being bullied (looking back I realise that I was actually bullied throughout year 3-6 also, most of my school life actually), so at the time I did not understand that if I let them, they wont stop. And the didn't. Almost my entire secondary school life, from year 8 - Year 11, I let them do it. Never fighting back, never telling anyone, and it just got worse.

My mum would always ask me if I was being bullied, but I always assured her nothing was wrong. I have the type of family to go and punch a random parents face in, before asking me who it was. The type that tell me to be normal, and not spend so much time on computer games. The kind that got their kicks from all getting drunk together and victimising a random person, I'll be honest I never liked my family. None of them were like me, complete opposites. They were the bullies in school.

At first I started out-smarting them, call-backs etc. but that didn't help at all, in fact most of the time they were able to flip it around and onto me.

Eventually I just started ignoring the bullies, literally denied that they existed at all and everything they did just did't happen, because telling a teacher you were being bullied was the equivalent of ""snitching on someone in a murder case"" at my school. Not only that, but I had to make my own way into school &amp; home, which was a 1 hour journey so i was afraid what they would do after school. Then they started doing worse things, trying to provoke me. Following me everywhere, actually punching me in the gut or throwing apples at me across the school yard. After that, I purposely sat near the cafeteria staff at lunch, near the teachers desk during lessons etc. 

One day they just stopped.

I have no explanation for it, maybe they had lost interest/couldn't do it any more because their ""authority"" didn't extend past their own self security? Maybe it was because I wouldn't give them their ""kicks""? Honestly, I have no idea.

However this still affected me, I was always ""that kid"". The one to fuck up on a presentation, the one who can't speak to girls etc. Truth is, because of those bullies, I never got the chance to be ""normal"", people would just laugh at me and never give me a chance with anything. The only good thing I had going was my GCSE's, and even then I was barely passing. So consider what this may to do you long-term.

No one can tell you what to do, because everywhere is different. In one place, it's considered ""ok"" to go and tell somebody because the parents/teachers are actually decent people who will help you, but the same goes for the opposite (which, unfortunately, is what i had). Some people are just horrible people, and there is nothing we or anyone can do to change that.

I hope this can, in any way, help you with your situation and I hope its the right one. No one deserves to be bullied, unless they want to be the bully. Nasty little shits, all of them.


However I do advise you to not be like me. I am probably fucked up for life because I just let it happen. To this day I can not talk to girls,  i have to have everything i want on a list in my head before I make an order at a cafe, because I am still afraid of messing up.

Get in shape. Your body is the only one you get, and when it's gone, so are you, so you might as well have one you're proud of and that will serve you well and carry you far. Some of what the others are saying are a bit too specific, I'd think, and is more focused on /r/fitness topics, but pretty much it boils down to eating healthy and getting exercise. If you're too big, do cardio and cut down on food, if you're too small, eat more and lift.

Do activities to be proud of, that'll make you feel better about yourself and give you something to talk about and throw yourself into. Volunteer, build things, join a group, ect. You're already in college (which is something to be proud of already), so join clubs, go to whatever events your campus is hosting, ect. Anything that lasts and gives back to the community is an added plus, as you can look back on it and know YOU have made the world a better place.

Force yourself to socialize. A drama improvisation class helped me with this big time, but really, any group or club or class or job where you have to talk to people, will do. I recommend you take a public speaking or leadership or drama class this upcoming semester.

Check out /r/getmotivated, /r/socialskills, and other motivation/selfhelp/selfimprovement sites and boards. The important thing, it's to be who you want to be. If you don't like your looks, change them. If you're stupid, grab a book. If you don't think you're funny, join a comedy club, any problem or excuse you have you can fix.

You are you. Nobody else knows your hopes, your fears, your insecurities but you, and they can't, unless you show them. It's entirely up to you to be who you are. And no amount of Reddit or any other guide will help you unless you take their advice and go out there and try it.

The funny thing is, a lot of your classmates feel awkward and shy too, so you're not weird or unusual for feeling that way. It's normal to feel anxious when a whole room of strangers is staring at you. Grown-ups also have this anxiety and few get over it. Taking an acting class or debate class will help you deal with it, which will pay off in a big way later in life. Know that if you're speaking in front of a class, most of the kids are just sitting there feeling happy that they're not doing it at the moment, and no one is really judging you personally.

One way to make conversation easy is to ask questions. Have you heard this tip before? Ask a person what they think, or what they like, and automatically they think of you as an interested, friendly person and will open up to you. Once they answer your question, you can respond naturally and you'll have a great conversation. If someone comes up to you and wants to talk, assume good will on their part first, and respond in a friendly manner. Turn the conversation to them as quickly as possible.

Real friendships take time and effort, so don't expect to make BFFs very soon. Be yourself and be honest, and the right people will find you. No matter what, you must believe in yourself and be your own best friend. Good luck!",1

But first, I’m sorry you are struggling with anxiety, and have had to deal with a hurtful parent. That is genuinely hard, and it’s awesome that you are becoming more aware and want to change this about yourself.

Now, some general things everyone can use a refresher on sometimes:

hanging onto other people won’t ever make you feel less lonely. It’s true to some extent that we need some social interaction, and introverts crave less frequent, but more “deep” social interactions that can be harder to come by, but the truth is that when you’re trying to prolong contact with friends, you’re just distracting yourself from loneliness, not feeling less lonely. Your loneliness is not externally induced, but rather coming from a place of lack of self-acceptance. There is then a resulting anxiety that fills in the blanks of how to externally obtain that, when in reality, you just need to be better at being there for you to feel less lonely. Do you like yourself? Do you feel comfortable with yourself? Do you feel like you know who you are as a person? — start there. 

You can’t control how other people perceive you. There is absolutely nothing you can do to be a perfect friend, or “make” somebody like you. They either will or they won’t. Did that sink in? I just want to emphasize: Changing yourself, trying super hard, draining your energy, etc is a waste of time and won’t change anybody’s mind. Who you are as a person isn’t dependent on those shallow things and real friends want to be friends with the real you, and humans are good at detecting whether or not something feels genuine. — Really, all that matters is that you have good intentions, and you’re treating them kindly. 

For the record, you are not trapped. Even if you have to go to the next town over, I promise you can go to therapy and you can request a different therapist at the clinic. And if you really don’t want to, there are licensed therapists online that you can have sessions with over the phone, or through messaging. All of this in both cases are all governed by HIPPA. In short, it basically means it is a big fat crime for a therapist to share any information about you—nobody has to know you’re gay if you don’t want them to! Which btw, fuck them if they don’t accept you! You are 100% as valid and important as anybody else! You deserve to feel and express your attraction and love the same way everybody else does! 

Also, In my personal opinion, the Bible will just leave you more lonely. 

I hope you feel better. You deserve happiness, kindness, acceptance and peace. I challenge you to offer that to yourself, and others! 

Best of luck.",0

You’re only 18 which means you have a lot of time to find the right people and feel comfortable with the right group of friends but I have empathy for you because I have a friend who has autism (middle school). He was on the spectrum but his condition was not as severe and he was allowed to be in our classes with little attention (some special attention here and there). But no one would speak to him as a friend, everyone would make fun of him on the side. I, regretfully, found myself also engaging in these mean comments and it wasn’t until I was assigned to be his “buddy” for the week by my homeroom teacher that I actually spent time with him and got to know him. 

Don’t worry too much about these friend groups lad. You’re life is very long and you are young, and as you grow older, people generally become a little bit more compassionate and empathetic. It sucks to hear that you’re doubting yourself as to whether you could get hired and that you’re unsure of what you want to do in the future, but my suggestion would be just to start with some small baby steps. Maybe start with small social interactions in stores (saying hi or hello to the cashier while checking out) or asking for help to find something. Just to increase how often you talk to people. Just a suggestion but whatever works for you. 

And it sounds to me like you have social anxiety, welcome to the club :) I always doubt myself and think 40 times before I say stuff to strangers and if it doesn’t come out right I contemplate on it for a while too lol. I understand where you’re nervousness and doubt comes from. I do hope that you’re able to find even just a friend or acquaintance that you can talk and interact with. But being a kid who isn’t on the autism spectrum, I’m assuming it’s not that easy to do. Please hang in there and maybe instead of worrying too much about how you interact with others and how they treat you, DO YOU! spend some time to yourself and figure out what you may want to do in the future now that you’ve graduated. If you’re around people that like the same thing as you, social interactions may seem a lot easier and natural.
