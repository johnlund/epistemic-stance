Picture this; it’s the early 2000’s you’re a young female about 10 years of age. You’re going camping with your best friend and her family and you pull up to a roadside porter potty stop point. You look super dorky in your baggy purple sweatpants and a t shirt because the fashion for kids at that time was awful. It’s your turn to use the porter potty, there’s a long line of other road trippers behind you. You use the toilet, walk past the line of people, when your friends mom runs up to you to detach the 15 feet of toilet paper connecting you to the toilet paper roll that got caught in your sweatpants when you pulled them up. You never forget 😂",2,absolutist,0.8107608,0.17330833,0.015930826,True,multiplist_as_absolutist,0.8107608
