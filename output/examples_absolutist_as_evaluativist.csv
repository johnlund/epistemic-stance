Purely because it's not really a big deal. It's not even a deal of any kind. People often times, especially us milennials, talk about such meaningless shit, that it never ceazes to amaze me, that actually 'those' people usually find themselves within a huge circle. Do you know why? It's the small talk and 'those' guys constantly have a mouth full of it. Though it's not apparent at first, small talk is the number 1 easiest way to establish a foundation with pretty much any human being, so long as they allow you to by listening.

So, in answer to your dilemma: no. You're not weird. If anything, you stand out from the crowd by having those two unique traits that make you who you are.

They love having emotional male friends around them. 
I speak from my experience, because in a way I too was somewhat similar to you. I thought that by being open about literally every aspect of my life, with a chick I liked, was gonna make her warm up to me and trust me and stuff like that. And it was working precisely like that, alright! But not in the right direction I wanted it to go, instead drifting off to.. where? Yes, friend-zone. So I did find myself wondering about it too. What the hell? My mum taught me to be a gentleman after all. So I was. Then, years later I found channel on Youtube called BasedZeus and everything started to come to me straight. I found the truth of the universe. Chicks love bad guys who don't give two shits about them and then ghost them, when girls try to reach them in text. And you'd be amazed, but it started to work for me like immediately, as soon as I applied those principals. I swear to God, ghosting a chick on Messenger or text is the biggest turn on for her. Because for all she knows, you have got such busy and amazing life that u didn't even have time to pick up the phone.
Nah, but seriously, you're okay, dude. Again if I was talking to you, I wouldn't even notice anything weird about this. And also, that bit about u being too open, I daresay if anything, it'll make people like you more. That's just my perspective though.

Personally, I think people who like to debate/argue are hard to like. People have a variety of beliefs about different things even if they're complete rubbish. But lots of people don't want to constantly be corrected on their stupid opinions, they'd rather keep them and be ignorantly happy. They are likely to go super-defensive and make up complete crap in order to protect their views and don't see these situations as an opportunity to exchange opinions or ideas.

My question is a bit practical, but also clarifying. Do you want to learn to dance and enjoy it as some other people do? Or do you want to learn how to feel better about yourself and clear out the insecurities you carry in your mind often times during social events? You may pick both actually. If dancing is something you really would love to be good at.

Let's start with You. Why do you believe you feel that way? And why do you believe it's not a good thing to happen to you - to have such feelings? In my understanding those feelings are perfectly fine for a person with undeveloped emotional body. Whether you'll carry them through your life or let yourself understand and accept them is really up to you. Having feelings is normal. Having feelings you decided to label bad is normal as well. Being suicidal because of that is not uncommon but it's in most people's understanding not healthy. Back to the basics. What world do you believe you are living in? Is it a hostile place, or is it a friendly place? That's a core believe, but it also reflects how you treat yourself. Do you love and appreciate yourself or do you treat yourself badly? And if you treat yourself well, probably you would not imagine yourself to be living into a hostile world. You will pick the friendly world. Are you ready to understand that you are making this choice all the time? By deciding what other people's behavior mean to you. But not only that. You have the Creator's power within you, and from that core understanding and belief, you paint on top of reality your version of it and experience it the way you believe it to be in your core. You can at any given tume change your core beliefs and the relationship you have with yourself. You can also be aware how that fulfillment changes your capacity to recognize certain things in other people's behavior. Your interpretations and reactions change, based on your way of perceiving.

Dude, it's normal to be awkward. Period. Love and appreciate this awkwardness (yourself really)! Check how Elvis Pressly was dancing back in the days. That was one of the most awkward thing people have seen at that time, and considered as a way of dancing. You can always go and visit some dancing lessons and even meet some great people and friends there. People you've never knew existed before. You have the capacity to connect with and relate to those people. You may even become passionate about dancing. It all starts with how you treat yourself, how you think about yourself, how you feel about yourself, and do you enjoy your own company! Next step based upon that clarification and if you decide to treat yourself better by your own love and appreciation towards yourself, you will really choose to believe that you are living in a good and friendly world. Because you can be good and friendly, actually everyone can if they choose to. And many choose to, after they meet another human being that has already chosen for himself/herself. Because it feels good. It feels good to be. It feels good to exist. It feels good to be yourself. And even when bad things happen and unpleasant feelings arise it's all right. That's also a way of being good to yourself - to let yourself experience those feelings and to appreciate yourself - the one capable to experience such feelings. No need for the blame game, no need for the shame game. They may happen on the surface as some form of joyful entertainment, but the core is different and everyone understands it is a joke and some of your friends may decide to perticipate in such a game for the joy of it. It becomes superficial. It always has been. You were not in the know of it. It's normal. Most people go through this one way or another. Some keep themselves away from themselves for their entire life. But even they at the end of their lives usually realize it for what it really was and let it go/get free from what they misbelieved to be true. Don't wait for the end. Do it now. And don't rush to end the life you are. It may end in its due time, it may not (most people don't know about this possibility). Live it fully and happily and joyfully and lovingly as much as you get capable of and then even some more. In a way you deserve it. In a way you owe it to yourself. In a way it's your inheritance. And I won't wish you happiness, I'd allow myself to feel happy for you right now. Because I choose to and it's my selfless way to be selfish. 😄

You are still relatively young and you will definitely make one or more friends until your death, although I would advise you not to talk about your eventual life like that.

I know your current situation to the extent that you feel very lonely and empty right now and don't know whether you really need friends or should look for friends or whether you need a relationship.

In your message you talk about a lot of small problems and it is difficult to go into everything individually but i try my best  


1. &amp;#x200B;

It's your life and of course you have to decide for yourself if you want to have friends. We can't dictate anything to you. But having one or more friends will help you in every point of view. You can go out with friends and do something, you can meet them, play games or travel with them. You can talk to them, talk about such problems/thoughts and get their opinion. you can do so much

Of course there will also be arguments, a possible break or you might get injured, but that's all human.

2

Having a relationship can also improve/beautify your life in many ways. You have someone you trust very strongly, who loves you as you know it from films/series/books etc. Hugs or sex will give you a lot of feelings of happiness/moments that you probably haven't really known before or can imagine.

Of course, problems can also arise here, but they are human again.

So in short:

Having friends or having a girlfriend has so many advantages and it improves your life in every aspect.

The other problem you indirectly posed is how to get there.

For that I can recommend you the posts in the pinned post on the Reddit server or you can read my older messages on other posts that (almost) all had the same problem as one should/can friends.",0,evaluativist,0.046351388,0.92598116,0.027667413,True,absolutist_as_evaluativist,0.92598116

Isn't that an interesting point? You can change for people, you can take all the effort and do fake things like fake smiling at strangers (even though there's clear evidence that points not only can people tell the difference between a real smile and a fake/women find smiling men less attractive. But that's all besides the point) but ultimately, people make whatever assumptions they want. People's perceptions are based on whatever emotion they stew themselves in.

People in America smile, people in Soviet Blocs don't - they think it's fake and slimy. I could go on. The fact is people are judgemental and despite whatever you think life is about, I'm sitting here telling you- To Me, focusing on all this dumb shit for the rest of your entire life, running these circles, playing all these fake games?

 But again, it doesn't matter because I could still explain this all to you and you still wouldn't really know how much more free you are doing it my way.

I don't leave people on read if I have time to respond and I'm in anything above a truly bad headspace. It's about 50-50 on initiating conversations and plans but that wasn't always the case.

At parties, I have a pretty good sense of who's there and doesn't want to be, who's there to get wasted, and who's looking to have a decent conversation and a lot of fun. I stick around the people who are there to have fun or at least open to it.

Your friends almost sound like they operate on a ""gang"" dynamic, in that, once someone leaves or is banned from the group they become the enemy or a target for being picked on and bullied... and THIS is not what friends do! Something is very wrong with that, and it also sounds like these individuals could either be any combination of jocks, spoiled-ass rich kids or ""Boyz from the Hood."" On that note... let me tell you a little story about me.

I know middle school and even high school can be difficult, but I also recall that I had solved these problems by the time I became a senior in high school be carefully picking my friends and associates. My dear young friend let me tell you something... I am Black and I went to an all Black school in Jacksonville, FL many years ago and before they finally integrated the students and teachers. This school had students that came from three different housing projects and a few low-income areas on the westside of town. I had to fight my way through middle school just to keep my damn lunch money and stand up for myself when one of the high school bullies decided to try and punk me. I was that Black kid who just didn't fit it with a lot of kids because I did not care for all the ghetto crap or fighting. I also spoke a little differently in terms of my vernacular which attracted problems at times. LOL I liked a wide variety of music including R&amp;B, soul, pop, rock and contemporary stuff which also translated to a variety of races on behalf of the artists that performed all of this music. I even chose a pop song to sing in my high school play, but I typically sang soul music on the talent shows. I can switch genres back and forth to this very day and think nothing of it. (I think it's very safe to say that most Black people are not into that.) I was an only child from a broken home being raised by a great-grandmother, and I was kind of different in my manner for reasons I was yet to fully understand until I became an adult. As for high school... hell I didn't even TRY to associate with people or groups that acted too ""street, violent or ignorant."" I just stayed the hell away from them because I knew I didn't really like them. However, I managed to get a little tougher to the point where the vast majority of this bunch would leave me alone as well because they could see it in my face that I didn't want to be bothered. I learned to stand up to them if provoked, and if someone pushed me too far then someone had a real fight on their hands. (People have a way of knowing who to mess with and who not to mess with... believe this.) I met up with a guy in a nightclub (or disco) who attended my high school several years after we'd all graduated. He came out and told me that he used to watch me in school and noticed the way I used to select my friends which really surprised me because he and I were never actual friends, and I didn't really think ANYONE paid attention to the few people I hung with except me! LOL Well he was right because I made it a point to only associate myself with kids who acted and carried themselves like regular well-mannered (or semi-well mannered) kids. They weren't ""perfect"" people and neither was I, but NONE of them were ignorant, ghetto, delinquent, violent or bullies. I didn't even try to date girls who acted like ""hood girls"" because I knew they represented one lane and I was driving in another. I found myself attracted to young ladies who ACTED like young ladies (and married one just like that). The bottom line is that I hate and literally despise ghetto mentality and behavior to this very day... and even moreso now because I know myself, and I have accepted who I really am as a person and an individual. If you want to say childhood and school experiences contributed to this strong dislike for ghetto behavior then you would not be wrong. lol 

Now back to you. I told you some of my personal story as a means of telling you that you are going to get a little tougher and ""stand up for the person you really are inside."" When you make the decision to do this then trust me... it will show on the outside because it will be genuine. You need to continue to speak your mind not only to this group and group leader you've told us about, but with ""anyone"" because practice is good. You should also ""focus more on your future"" in terms of your college major and the career you hope to have one day. Immerse yourself in people and activities that ""make you smile"" and focus more on the people you like instead of those whom you dislike. If you start to do more of these things, you will find that you won't even have TIME to deal with this troublesome group or any other type of nonsense to start with. Maybe it's just time to stop trying to fit-in where you no longer fit-in and move on. Just become too busy.  

I think I understand your feelings, concerns and need to separate yourself on a more gradual basis, and I respect them as well... so go ahead and do it gradually, but you can also do it more quickly if you make some changes in your own life and thinking. Start allowing yourself to experience and enjoy the company of other people whom you might have more in common with in terms of personality, interests understanding of the words ""mutual respect."" You need to move beyond this group of flakey and shakey individuals with a jerk for a ring leader because there's just something wrong with this group dynamic... and it really doesn't sound right for you because it's not who you are. You just seem to be more down-to-earth, intelligent that calm person who tolerates these people just to have friends, and people like you deserve better. 

Now here is where it gets really serious: If the spirit ever leads you to do so... you should pull the group leader away from the rest of the group or catch him or her alone one day and flat confront them about their behavior. It doesn't have to be angry... just be honest straight-forward, logical, vary rational but above all.. UNAFRAID. You will get better and more interesting results if you do this privately because if you try it in front of the group it could get ugly because you will have put this jerk on the spot and he/she will react in whatever way they deem necessary to hold power. lol If ever you decide to do this, you absolutely cannot be nervous, afraid or unsure of yourself in any way because he or she will sniff it out, sense it and try to pull a power play of some sort. You have to be ready for whatever no matter what and ready to deal with it. If it sounds like I'm saying you might even have to exchange a few punches that's exactly what I'm saying. Whatever you decide to do and however you decide to handle it... you have to stand up for yourself one way or another because you will encounter these type of people long after high school is over. I also want you to talk to your mom and dad or an older brother, sister, cousin or even a grand-parent about everything you've told me and see what they tell you as well. I will stop now, but I want you to have a great rest of your weekend and a good life. I've got a feeling great things are in store for you one day in your life, and everything you are experiencing and feeling now will help make it all come true.
