I'm joking mate, rest assured you're just the same as everyone else.

I remember being at Uni and a rugby 'lad' somehow ended up hanging with my mates - we were the 'play runescape, mount and blade and smoke weed all the time' crew and I didn't think we'd get on. Then he spotted my Band of Brothers collection and it turns out he is really into history and the Second World War and lots of other stuff you wouldn't attribute to the traditional rugby lad. 

Everyone is different and likes different things. I don't consider myself a nerd because I love Runescape and taking apart my PC etc. I also enjoy DJing and producing music with my mates, everyone has a multitude of hobbies.

Why carrots are orange, how you saw a perv in the club, about how you forgot to lock your door. What you did today, what you want to do.

Talk to entertain yourself. Picturing it like this helps me alot.

Laughter in my opinion is the best medicine. So aim to make yourself laugh and happy. If your stuff is doing silly dancing, messing about with people and making them uncomfortable then do that.

You'll notice those people who've been friends for years and years they sometimes rarely speak to each other. Just because your best friends dosnt mean you have to talk every second of every day of every week.

You need to find the formula, the balance between talking about yourself and them. Do more stuff, experiment, be silly, because then you'll have funny stories and more opinions about things.

What I'm trying to say is there's no answer, no framework to learn. And if your worrying about what to say to people and what to talk bout then that already tells you enough.. your spending time on thinking about what to say to people when you should be just getting on with your life and making yourself happy.

Everyone is different. For instance another thing I notice works is when I don't focus too much on the conversation. That way if my mind is focused on a task rather than the person I give a natural response saying what I truly want to say instead of filtering and thinking and thinking again and thinking I can't say that because of this or this because of that or this because it's too suggestive of this, etc.

I'm going to break it down into two main categories.

Self:

\- Have passions. (Make sure there are  topics you are excited to discuss and share with others. If you do not yet have thigns you enjoy, this takes priority as it is important for your health.)

\- Have ethics. (Make sure you have your own set of morality from which to base your interactions with other people. This is something that I personally value very much but others may not. It is up to you whether or not you wish to disregard this.)

\- Look decent. (This one is a real pain in the ass but extremely important. If you look like shit you will be treated like shit. It shouldn't be so but it is. Pay attention to how you dress, groom, and exercise. If two people are equally amicable, the good lucking one will appear more likable.)

&amp;#x200B;

Others:  


\- Others can be broken down to one major ideal and then several methods to achieve this ideal. Here is the ideal: EVERYONE WANTS TO FEEL VALUED. 

\- So... how do we make others feel valued? There are a lot of ways. Master these to start.  
1. Look people in their eyes. Yes, it matters.  
2. Smile at them. Practice your smile. No , easily seen through BS smile. Learn to believe your own smile.   
3. Talk to them about their interests. There is no way easier way to get others talking then to talk about their interests. This is harder than it seems . Don't just go, ""what do you like... oh that's cool."" Find their interests and speak in a way which is meant to have them as a mentor and you as a disciple. ""Wait, so you are a surfer? Oh, that's amazing I've always wanted to surf! Where do you surf? That's the beach with all the taco places right? Oh my god, I fucking love that place. So you're one of those super fit people I  see surfing all the time while I'm pounding fish tacos, huh?"" etc, etc, etc. It takes a LOT of practice to get good at this. You are going to seem very fake initially but once you get good you can talk with anyone.   
4. Compliment them sincerely (flattery doesn't count.) Find something you admire about the person that is neither shallow nor against their values and take earnest notice of it. There is a coffee place in front of my work. Everyone goes there before heading in and one of the girls there has one of the most stunning smiles you will ever see in your life. One day she hands me my coffee and I tell her this. I go, ""You know, (name), you honestly have one of the best smiles I have ever seen in my life. Sometimes I think I'm coming here to see it rather than the caffeine. This was true. We text each other now.   


Here is the deal mate. You're young and you have a lot of life to learn. I didn't learn these lessons until my ass had been whopped ten ways to Sunday. I still have a lot to learn. Nobody is ever the perfect statesman and the best are constantly practicing. Abraham Lincoln used to write down his negative thoughts rather than expressing them. Reagan took notes on subjects he didn't understand that he knew his friends cared about. The both of them studied OTHERS andcared about OTHERS. They slowly perfected the art of making those others feel valued.

My parents called her their adopted daughter, her mom called me the same. She went on our family vacations - which was NOT a normal thing in my family. I can’t place enough emphasis on that. My parents neither could afford an extra body nor wanted the responsibility/discomfort. But she had become FAMILY. From 8th grade to junior year, I knew she was experimenting with things that I wouldn’t take part of. I knew she was more comfortable with boys than I was- by far. But I had no clue just how far she’d gone, until she admitted everything to me. We were going to bed, talking about the fun we planned to have that summer. She slipped and said ‘I’m going to have so much sex this summer!’ It wasn’t a joke. It wasn’t funny, either. She was not being responsible in any sense of the word. That was one of the last times we ever spoke. I couldn’t understand why for the life of me- I hadn’t berated or judged her. I only asked her to be careful and think about what’s best for her both short and long term. Now, I was no angel. Please don’t get me wrong. But I had boundaries that I stuck to. 
Fast forward 2 years. I run into her mom. She was working seasonally beside my permanent job. I was happy to see her but didn’t get the same reaction. She informed that she well knew what influence *I* had on her daughter, and what it had done to her. Told me that she moved to get away from the ‘bad’ people in her life- insinuating me and a boy she had admitted to sleeping with and smoking crack with (I’d never met him, still to this day -more than 12 years later- I’ve never smoked crack). I explained that I literally had NO CLUE what she was talking about and that frankly, if anything, she was a ‘bad influence’ on me. That I’d had nothing to do with any of the shenanigans she’d gotten herself into over the years. 
12 years later, all of her sisters seemingly still believe this crap. IT BROKE ME. It didn’t just break my heart, it broke ME. I had never been so confused, so mistaken, never been the ‘fall guy’ to this degree. We still haven’t spoken. I still think of her often. I still wonder WTF she would blame ME of all people. I still love her.

You can meet people at any time. It doesn't matter if they have friends or not. Chances are the people you do meet will already have friends and if you just meet one person, you can meet their friends through them. That's how networking and friendships work. You meet one person and then you meet another through that person and another and another. And if you get really good at just talking to strangers on the street, you can expand pretty fast (but I think that's way beyond what you're thinking about or wanting at the moment). You already know you can make some people laugh, right? Your current friends already enjoy you, right? Who's to say more people won't also enjoy you? Don't focus on trying to get anything out of anyone. Don't look for validation. Don't look for them to like you. Focus and remember that you are awesome to people that already know you and you can be awesome to people you just met too. Maybe you won't be as funny at first, but that doesn't matter. You'd be in the ""getting to know them"" phase. And this phase can be an exciting time! You can tell your story, make new jokes, find out about the other person.

Don't worry about pissing people off by saying the wrong thing. You WANT to piss some people off by being yourself. If you weren't being yourself, then when they do find about the real you (and they will), then they wouldn't be your friend anyway. And you don't want to be friends with people that won't be friends with the real you.

If you want a helpful book, read Dale Carnegie's How To Win Friends and Influence People. It's real simple, a lot of the concepts are straight forward and seem obvious. It's just nice that he actually says them and why they're important.

I'm not going to tell you whether they are right or wrong, or if you're right or wrong, I know neither you, nor that group.   
What I can tell you is - regardless of your faults, you as a lifeform intrinsically hold worth. Don't utilize this as a comeback to them, extolling your virtues and intrinsic worth, if they are literally as bad as what you say and what you've written isn't magnified(cognitive distortion), there's a chance they will find a way to turn that on its head. You don't need that right now. And they have things to fix themselves as well, because - yes, they too hold value.  


If you have the chance, visit a therapist, you need a support system and a therapist can provide at least one crucial pillar. In addition, add more 'positive' things to your life. Practice gratitude, 3 things you are grateful for, day and night, or just day in the beginning.   
The idea isn't to spit rainbow flavored raps, the idea is to build emotional resilience, gratitude helps us to do so, and also simultaneously starts allowing us to recognize and see other opportunities, and can help change our outlook on life. Find the smallest things you can be grateful for, atomic, protons/electrons, I'm not exaggerating here, believe me.   
As long as you think ""yeah it IS pretty great that's a thing"" then it counts for you, that's it.  
Practice cold showers at least thrice a week or daily if you can. They also aid in emotional resilience. Exercise will help as well, start by just walking/running as those are relatively simple to do without needing the whole trainer/program shebang. Essentially adding more coping methods for your life and environment, and look up classes that can teach you assertiveness in a healthy way.  


I'm tempted to add more, but too much help can interfere with growth and true independence building as well. I know things are hard, I've faced people who 'should' be better, 'should' have been more adult, but those shoulds themselves are a problem, we aren't in that world. But we can become part of the vanguard for it, by learning the things people already in that vanguard have picked up, and bettering ourselves.

Other people prefer to be early because that is respectful of other peoples time- it shows them that you prioritize their time even over your own. Your friend sounds like in this group.
