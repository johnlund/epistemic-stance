1. &amp;#x200B;

It's your life and of course you have to decide for yourself if you want to have friends. We can't dictate anything to you. But having one or more friends will help you in every point of view. You can go out with friends and do something, you can meet them, play games or travel with them. You can talk to them, talk about such problems/thoughts and get their opinion. you can do so much

Of course there will also be arguments, a possible break or you might get injured, but that's all human.

2

Having a relationship can also improve/beautify your life in many ways. You have someone you trust very strongly, who loves you as you know it from films/series/books etc. Hugs or sex will give you a lot of feelings of happiness/moments that you probably haven't really known before or can imagine.

Of course, problems can also arise here, but they are human again.

So in short:

Having friends or having a girlfriend has so many advantages and it improves your life in every aspect.

The other problem you indirectly posed is how to get there.

But lots of people don't want to constantly be corrected on their stupid opinions, they'd rather keep them and be ignorantly happy.

While confident in their recommendation, they acknowledge it as their perspective.","[""If I were you, I would"", ""this is just my opinion"", ""honestly, it couldn't matter less to me"", ""My best from"", ""You see"", ""The paradox of that is""]","Happy birthday!!!

If I were you, I would **shift the frame of reference**. 

Meaning that: instead of caring too much if people care about my birthday, I would care less about what other people think of me and more about what I think about myself.

Things like: Another year has passed for me: 

* How I improved myself? 
* Is my health better or worse than last year? 
* Are my finances better or worse? 
* Are my relationships better or worse?

You see, our minds can focus on very few things at any given moment so if you focus on what matters, you don't have to spend mental energy on things that don't matter (again this is just my opinion but honestly, it couldn't matter less to me if people even know I have a birthday).

The paradox of that is that if you do just that, you will increase your worth in society as a healthier, richer, happier person. **And more people will start being attracted to you**. People that matter, people that want the best for you and will contribute to your well-being for many more happy birthdays :)

Whenever possible I let people have a for-sure answer whether we're doing something at a particular time/day/place. Nobody wants to keep a big question mark on their calendar hoping you make up your mind. If you say you're going, fucking go and go at the understood time.

I don't leave people on read if I have time to respond and I'm in anything above a truly bad headspace. It's about 50-50 on initiating conversations and plans but that wasn't always the case. I spent a lot of time initiating and following through on plans, so people are happy to invite me to parties and plans because I'm actually fun, I actually care, and I actually show up. 

At parties, I have a pretty good sense of who's there and doesn't want to be, who's there to get wasted, and who's looking to have a decent conversation and a lot of fun. I stick around the people who are there to have fun or at least open to it. I try to include everyone as much as possible but I'm not going to pry my way into someone's bubble who doesn't want to join the party. This is doubly true for people who've very clearly decided before arriving that they aren't going to enjoy themselves. 

The main thing I can recommend is practice and persistence until it becomes natural.

soc_351225,389,absolutist,high,low,none,"The writer presents dating advice as definitive facts using certainty language like '100% okay', 'Period', and 'WAY WAY better'. They make broad generalizations about women's behavior ('Girls cheat just as much as guys') as objective truths without qualification. While they acknowledge some variability ('Not all girls', 'hit or miss'), they frame this as tactical considerations within an overall certain framework rather than genuine uncertainty about their claims.","[""100% okay"", ""Period"", ""WAY WAY better"", ""Girls cheat just as much as guys"", ""That is enough of a sign"", ""you have to be firm"", ""Just stay focused""]","1) Yes it's 100% okay to go on multiple dates. Just be clear to the girl you're hanging out with that you don't jump into dating until at least a month or 2 in. Because you got to get to know them. Nothing polygamous about it. 

2) I doubt girls focus on one guy at a time (Not all girls). Girls cheat just as much as guys. And I am sure they have gotten comments from many many men. Wait to see how these girls react to you in the long run that you do what you want, they should want to keep your attention. The app deleting/Talking to no one else is a sign they want you long term (REALLY good sign), but it's UP TO YOU in the end what you want to do. Don't get emotional about your choice or feel bad, especially if you haven't been on a date yet. 

If a girl is talking to you. That is enough of a sign that she's interested in dating you. Even sometimes when she's not talking to you it's a sign she could be interested. Some people like to get testy with you to see how you'll react, but you have to be firm and confident in your action making. (But if a girl tells you to back off. Then BACK OFF. Period.)

As well, Meeting people in real life like bars, clubs, social gatherings can be WAY WAY better if you have a few hours on the weekend and the confidence to talk to a lot of girls. I have actually gotten a couple dates from girls I've met at bus stops (Not straight up ""Lets date"" but more like ""Hi, What are you taking at university?"".) Which can be much more rewarding when you meet the right girl. Be open. 

As for online dating, It's hit or miss for me. Some girls will give a lot of feedback, some not as much. Just stay focused, text once in a while, have a good time, try to set up a date when there is availability. Send a girl a joke or a story. If she doesn't reply send her something else in a couple days. And then ask her out within the next 2 days after that. Online dating is a long term game sometimes.

But i'll give you my detail of some people i started knowing in my classes and how i met them.  Usually the people in my class whether they are a little bit further away or next to me.  The ones next to you are easier because they're next to you and you can just make a small conversation of like.  How did you do on the exam? or How was the homework?  Eventually you guys can lead to small subjects.  I sometimes compliment them on something if I really mean it.  Don't do it just to compliment but if you actually mean it, it has a bigger effect.  This girl I remember we just talked about school most the time.  I usually ask oh you taking any other classes besides this?  What's your major?  IF they're undecided, i usually say something to uplift them like im sure you'll find out what you want to do.  There is something you like to do right? :)  

I mostly talk about them and what they're into.  If you notice they seem to be a little bit annoyed then its time to back away.  You don't want to be the pushy interrogation guy.  You just want to know enough, and let it be.  Let them talk to you again instead.  Start over the next day.  Good morning or hows it going *name*.  How's ur day been?  and you can reset it again.  After a while you guys get used to each other depending on the person.  Everyone is different.  They have different people they prefer to hang out with.  My group around me we hung out together during the breaks of our classes because it was a Lab.  And we talked to each other because we needed help.  We ended up asking for each other's facebook.  And was like hey, what's do you got a facebook?  We could help each other on the work if anything.  That's just my to go advice.
