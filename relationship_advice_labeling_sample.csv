rel_29014765,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,391,"My wife frequently points out things about her body that she hates.  I've been with her for nearly 13 years now and we have 2 kids together.  She is 100% the most attractive woman I have ever been with, and I don't care whatsoever about those small things.  I know she does though, so I try to not ignore her when she speaks about them.  It's not that I don't notice the things she points out, but they pale in comparison to everything else about her that is absolutely insanely attractive to me.

I never agree with her when she starts beating herself up over her body, but it's impossible for me to correctly articulate how I feel about her physical appearance in words at that moment.  I can't say ""yes, I see the thing you are complaining about, but it has no impact at all to how hot you are"" without it sounding disingenuous, because I don't ever want her to think that these things matter in the slightest.

When I was younger, I'd opt for the route that I'd guess your husband appears to be taking here; pretend it doesn't even exist.  It always seems like a good option at the time, but it has the possibility of backfiring (as it appears to have done here) because it comes across as not paying attention or not acknowledging your partner.

I'd venture to guess he probably has a hard time articulating his feelings.  Taking it even further (and my apologies if my assumption here is incorrect), judging by your willingness to talk so openly about your stretch marks, I'd guess you're probably a pretty strong woman that's not afraid to tell your husband what you're thinking.  This may make it hard for him to want to talk about it with you.  Especially since he loves you and knows intimacy is a sore subject.

I'd sit him down and tell him how you are feeling, let him know how the lack of intimacy is bothering you and you want to know why things seem to have changed.  Try not to frame it as a ""him"" problem or an attack.  Approach him as a caring spouse that noted a change in behavior, and you want to get to the bottom of it to make sure he's OK and help find a solution."

2nd you need to tell your man… How are you gonna be in a 7 year relashinship and cheat on him then not tell him? Because your scared he might end it? Or yall will be in a “rough go”?
So your just not gonna say anything

If he did it would you want him to tell you? Or would you want him to lie to you and never say anything at all?

You know the answer to this..
Your just looking for validation on the internet to lie to him… And you wont get that here. 
You where a shitty person, own up to your mistakes."

Being honest about how you feel and addressing the issue is the best thing to do or you’ll start to resent him. You also may have to realize that he may not be completely healed from the relationship and you need to decide if you want to stay in it while he works through his feelings. I hope you’re able to work through it if that’s what you both really want. 🤞🏽"
rel_28943878,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,185,"Once he's 18 can he just go with you to do those things? 

This is the conundrum of young love.  On the one hand,  you're happy and not necessarily looking for a reason to break up.  But on the other hand, you're only young once.   

The thing here is, long term relationships in your age group have a success rate approaching zero.  Not because of anything against you two, but because you're young and you're going to change A LOT over the next several years.  18-25 is a pretty big deal, and hell,  18-30 is gigantic.  It seems unlikely you're going to literally spend the rest of your life with a guy you met when he was 15.  Yes it happens, but these are the rare exceptions.   

If you're feeling the itch, you may never get the chance to scratch it.   My first long term GF was from mid high school into college.  I was perfectly willing to forego any of the being young ""nonsense"" for her, but she broke up with me later.  Now I fully recognize that she actually did me a favor."
rel_9302893,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,309,"I'm a woman and had the same situation as you, well he didn't give me anything that belonged to a ex. He did keep a small plushie heart, he threw it away later because I wanted him to do that.

He also still talked to this ex, not really flirty or that 'i want you back' shit. That was pretty much impossible since she lives across the Atlantic ocean... 

At that time I was very very insecure and that made me jealous. So jealous that I couldn't even let him look at boobs that pop up in movies... 

That jealousy and being nosey in everything, made him break up with me. We did come back to each other after like 5 months. During the time we were broken up, he went back to his country to see his family. Guess what happened... he goddamn kissed that stupid ex! I can't blame him since we were broken up but it did confirm that she was still going after him and was a huge rock between me and my bf. 

The day he came back, he messaged me asking if I could come over. I did and since then we haven't been separated since. Oh and haven't heard anything about that ex anymore. He isn't interested in her in any way. We're now (after the break up) 8 years together with a beautiful daughter!

All I can ask is: is he still contacting her? Is she still in the picture somehow? If so, I would have a serious talk about what you expect from him so that you can lose the anger. I think your anger is more having difficulty trusting him and that is completely reasonable! 

If he just can't seem to detach himself from her (if there is still contact), it is you that needs to detach from him."
rel_15780811,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,113,"There was an episode of Forensic Files with a similar situation. To create a criminal case, the woman first of all snuck some of her drugged drink out and got it tested. She also set up a hidden camera to film her boyfriend drugging the drink (hide your phone behind a plant or something?). 

I rarely advocate calling the cops, but if you want to stop him — which seems like a good idea, because he could go on to do this to other people — you probably need to ask the police what they would need in order to create a case against him. 

I'm very sorry this is happening to you."
rel_3340749,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,260,"The bullying in the past was obvious - she had intense feelings around you and she saw no interest in you so she childishly punished you. I am sure her tears were genuine. So what about saying her let us just try it for a few month as if to acknowledge it just may go awry. Also never forget that abusers learn abusing at home. Without that they rarely get mean. I did have a girlfriend - or just a girl / she was 12 I was 14/ who asked me if I wanted to "" get together"" with her? And I was frightened for my back was full of akne and said No. Plus she was a bit too chubby. And she instantly hit my face. / I don't know the English word for it./ Then we spent decades in the same friendly circle. Eventually she married my best friend. But at that time we began to get a distance with him. /He also started to get fat and we had job isuues. I like skinny people./Then 2 more decades passed and my friend died. And we started to meet weekly. But I wrote lots of poems in my grief and she got angry / she felt her hubby grief should belong only to her/ and told me to stop seeing her. (Among friends we occasionally meet but no more trust remains in me.) I mean if someone can completely detach from you / even if it originates in a deeper connection need/ then it remains a troubled friendship. "
rel_3678349,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,227,"Thank you. Just, thank you. I agree with everything you said and it’s a huge relief to hear someone agree with me. These are huge hard decisions for me and I never know if I’m doing the truly best thing. The best part of it all is that he doesn’t want to suddenly be a parent to my son. He doesn’t want his visitation back, he’s not asking to see him but this one time. Even then it was just a text to appease his mother and probably wife. He knew I would say no and then I get to be the bad guy. 







I am definitely going to stick to my guns. Hardest decision of my life but I’ve made it and feel confident in it. I did respond to her that we both would love to see her and I will do whatever necessary to make it work. She responded that that’s not going to work, as she’s making the drive with them. She is clearly disappointed but I think she expected it. I’m tempted to respond to her and politely but firmly ask her not to put me in this situation again. But this whole thing is kind of wearing me down and I’m just going to let it be for now. 







Thank you again. Your words have made my day much, much easier. "
rel_28762089,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,335,"I think everyone is really overlooking how much this big a weight gain can impact sexual interest. Like I think it's fair for her to say you're not as attractive to her anymore but because she loves you she's willing to overlook sex. You obviously shouldn't be only into looks, but it's unfair to expect someone to just look past it entirely.

That said it is weird that such a sentiment wasn't shared sooner, it feels like you lack communication. That kind of thing should have been brought up six months ago when she noticed the lower attraction. Also strange that her first impulse is to say ""it's okay we just won't have sex"" instead of ""if you lose some weight I would probably be more attracted to you again"", though maybe she didn't want to hurt your feelings.

If I was in your place, I would probably start working out and do whatever I can to stop stress eating as much as possible, but also like, have a serious discussion with her. If she does think you losing weight would help then that's probably a good sign, if she thinks it won't change anything then the people saying she's using you might be more right than I thought. You could also ask her to help you with it if she approves that.

I dunno I never want to assume the worst in these situations but it's obviously a possibility. She is dependent on you which doesn't help to make sure she's 100% honest, but people saying that because of that she's obviously using you, that I'm not sure I agree with.

Edit: also some people are out there leaving comments like ""she wants the benefits without the cost"" and it really feels like a toxic mentality, like giving him sexual gratification is her job and she must do it whether she wants it or not. Something is wrong in this situation but it's definitely not that ""she's not holding her end of the bargain"""
rel_31277822,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,270,"You are conflating two issues that should be handled separately.  There is her irresponsibility with money and the other issue is how to divide control of finances.  The division of control has many choices but consider her contribution to your household besides finances.  If she becomes a stay at home mom should she get 0 say with the budget?  That's not fair either.

For deciding on budgeting control,  You might want to allot a certain amount of monthly money to both of you that's the same, like 4k for her and 4k for you to spend on whatever you want.  The rest goes into an account to decide by both of you.  If you two can't agree on big purchases and the shared account reaches a threshold(e.g. 100k) then 50k of that goes into an investment account recommended by your financial planner so at least it's being used wisely and will result in more money down the road.
This is just an example.  Even though you two may not have the same attitudes on budgeting it does require you two to be mature adults who can compromise.  If that's not true then it should have been dealt with before marriage or counseling right now.

For the more difficult issue of what you perceive as her financial irresponsibility it will require you two align your future goals more.  If you are planning to achieve wealth that will last for generations and are thinking long term, but she is focused on enjoying her wealth now, that is a very big misalignment and will also require maturity and compromise from both of you."
rel_20827820,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,359,"I will tell you my story- met my gf first when I was 16 she was 17 in college, became close friends but I was always sure that I didnt want to date before being set up in my career, which was at least 6-7 years away, she was very sure that she didnt want to invest emotionally in anyone before being settled in her career, so she casually dated during college. We were very good friends and physical attraction was always there but we never acted on it. We passed out, she went to do her Masters in Economics, I did my MBA, we both still stayed in touch and both got very high paying jobs. 10 years after we first met, we both moved to the same city for our jobs. We met and she said maybe we should finally see if anything can happen between us, lol. Well, that was 6 years ago and we are still together and about to be married in July, if Covid permits, fml. About 6 months into our relationship we were talking as to what would have happened if we had started dating during college, would we still be together? And we both reached the conclusion that although we dont know the future, there was a 99% chance that we would have broken up at some point. 

Why I told you my story is to emphasize the point that sometimes we meet the right person at the wrong time, and it gets messed up. And thats what I see happening in your post, I am sorry. Its better for you guys to go separate ways now and maybe you reconnect later or maybe not.  But you are too young to settle for a familiar setting now. Go out, be your own person, put yourself first and then find someone to spend your life with. Maybe it will be him, or someone else.

PS- The 30 year old at the office seems like a creep, so stay away from him. I am 32 and theres no way a 30 year old has something in common with you. Stay away from him."

rel_21102958,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,351,"Well you've asked this question on an incredibly woke subreddit so I wouldn't be surprised if most people here tell you to suck it up. The cold hard truth of the matter is that you need to divorce her. She has been indoctrinated by the cult of woke, she is no longer the woman you married and she never will be again. Is she really worth listening to that nonsense all day every day? Remember she's getting steadily fatter, whilst refusing to do anything about it, it’s only a matter of time before she shaves her hair off and dyes her scalp pink. Then you get to spend the rest of your life with Ursula the sea Queen, a vile mass of saturated fat, hatred and foul body odour, who will lecture you every single day until you submit and get absorbed into the cult, or you top yourself. 

Victims of wokeness always become truly terrible, bitter, disgusting people, right now resentment is welling in her heart for you because you are a male, and if you're white, even more so, because to them you are the enemy. She will become even more domineering, she will try to control and subjugate you to show how much of a strong women she is; she will completely let herself go physically, she'll become morbidly obese, she'll stop shaving ''shaving is just a societal construct designed by the patriarchy to oppress women'' she'll stop showering . 

And god forbid you ever have children with her. She will spend their formative years brainwashing them to be trans then get them on untested, potentially dangerous hormone blockers that fuck up their puberty and give them lifelong incurable depression, just so she can look virtuous to her woke friends.

 Man I hope the picture I've painted here is vivid enough for you but this is your future if you stay with her, these people are evil, if I was you I'd run now, I mean literally right now, run out the house, send a friend back for your stuff, file for divorce, escape before it’s too late."
rel_1830026,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,250,"I don't open up to anyone.  And I don't drink, either, so I'm never in a position where my inhibitions are lowered which would make me want to talk.  I have a lot of deep things that I don't tell anyone, including my SO.

But he never asks me about them so I feel okay not talking about them.

We have a sort of relationship where we completely respect each other's privacy.  He'll tell me stuff if he wants to and if he doesn't want, then I'm okay with that.  And if I don't want to talk about something then I don't and he doesn't force me to.

I'm not going to lie - this has caused some major issues.  We trust each other insanely much but there's no substitute for communication in a relationship.  The only reason this has managed to work thus far is that neither of us is lying to the other person.

We both have completely separate lives outside of our house and, more often than not, I have no idea what he's doing on any given day.  He also has no idea what I'm doing.

It's not ideal by any stretch but somehow it works okay for us.  If I were to ask about what he's doing he'd tell me and if he were to ask about what I'm doing, I'd tell him.  It's not like we're keeping secrets.

If you call her or message her and it’s all about her little sister, of course she doesn’t think you give an actual shit about her. You were an absent-to-neglectful parent and you only message her about the child you do actually show up for.

At this point, if you want to have a relationship with your older daughter, you need to admit to yourself that you are basically strangers and that it is in large part your fault. I understand you had rougher circumstances that complicated things. But an honest apology that doesn’t get followed up with excuses is step one. Step two is actually express real and honest interest in your daughter and who learning who she has grown into.

This doesn’t all need to be in person. You don’t need her to come to your house and sleep in an office for weeks at a time to get to know her. You can text her and call her and talk about literally anything as long as it is not 1. Her sister 2. Making excuses for why you did a shit job with her 3.

There is likely to be a smaller pool of people who are able to see past no penetration initially, but I can’t see why it should prevent a happy and healthy relationship.

rel_4574263,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,255,"As someone who just recently got married so the whole transition from dating to marriage is still very fresh, I'd say this is probably a couple of red flags. 

I'll say this though, I'd wait to see if the demand was a knee jerk reaction. If she holds to that, that's probably a relationship killer imo. If she doesn't and she cools off, I could see the relationship continuing for sure but with two extremely necessary talks happening first. 

First, there has to be a talk about privacy. That's extremely concerning that she is snooping like that. There obviously shouldn't be secrets in relationships, but at the same time, what if you need to hide a gift for them? It's also less about secret keeping and more about trust. In a long term relationship both partners have to be able to trust each other. Her snooping says she doesn't trust you. Even if you trust her and love her to death, you can't keep a relationship going if she doesn't trust you (whether justified or not). 

Second, there needs to be a talk about ""demands and threats."" I don't think much more needs to be explained there. It should be very clear that those aren't healthy relationship actions. 

Good luck with whatever you decide in the end, and keep in mind, almost anything can be worked out if both parties want to work it out in earnest. In order to do so however, they must actually be worked out instead of swept under the rug. "

I don't think the issue is figuring out how to reignite your desire for him, but about being honest with yourself about *why* you feel that way. is it hormones or something else? regardless, it might be important to talk with him about this instead of forcing yourself to have sex - I assume he wants you to also enjoy it, and wouldn't want you to feel 'obligated.'

Loving someone that doesn't respect you is a recipe for disaster, and the only way you can move on from her is by cutting her off and giving yourself time to recover from this wound.

If you want her to come around you have to put yourself in her shoes. How would you feel if a girl did what you did? She told you she liked you but you don't quite feel the same way. She talks often about being a couple when you aren't even sure you like her, but she is a nice girl! I'm sure you would want her to back off a bit. If you saw her having fun, being happy then it would give you time to realize her personality. One night you try to message her but she doesn't respond. Instead she is out, having a good time, looking sexy af with her friends, and she's posted pics on her social media having a good time. Dam, suddenly you like her! So that's my advice. Back off, stop being as available.  Go out and have fun with your friends. Stop asking her out, if she wants to hang out she can ask as well. Let her miss you. In the mean time, just remember that she isn't your world. You are free to date whomever you want so don't settle for her. When you do talk to her, make her laugh, tease her but talk about your life as well. "

rel_30614029,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,379,"I think you both need to be more clear and appropriate in your communication. He should have mad with clear he was going to play a new game when y'all got home, that way at least you can entertain yourself with feeling awkward or like you're just sitting there doing nothing. And you need to verbally state ""I would like some affection before I go to sleep"". 

I haven't seen this mentioned, so I'll leave this here; the leap in maturity from 19 to 22 is large. This is your first relationship, and I can relate. My first relationship was when I was 17 with a 21 year old. He would play games for HOURS, without notice to me. It only worked for so long because I am also a gamer, and would entertain myself. However, with him being so much more of an adult than me, he needed to be the adultier adult and communicate better. He didn't. By the time I broke up with him (21/25), I was sick of how infantile he was in the relationship. No communication, no regard for my needs, and if I communicated properly, he acted like a child. I don't think your bf is acting as mine did, but please just be aware of the differences. He should be a bit more involved and aware, and if he can't be, needs to work on his communication.

ALSO. I would recommend you just kinda settle in for a while. Both my ex and my husband are SoulsBourneSekiro fans, and I'm fully expecting my husband to shut down and out once he gets Elden Ring LOL. I knew exactly what game he was playing when you started your post!! 

Quick aside; forgot to add this above. If you have any hobbies or crafts you could do while he plays, do it. My husband will get lost in games for hours, and sometimes he doesn't want to directly engage with me, but wants me around. Ask your bf if this is the case, and let him know you don't mind if that's the case, but you still need to be checked in on periodically and need affection.

I know I didn't enter strong and as a 30 year old man now, I definitely beat myself up for 4 years after graduating college and figuring out what I wanted to do. It sounds like he doesn't understand where you mentally are right now and isn't able to show empathy for it. If he's attacking you as a person rather than critiquing your formative decisions about your career, that's inexcusable imo. Even if he was criticizing your decisions, he should be offering tips either on how he decided his plans or help your planning process. For examples, write down your strength and weaknesses, what you enjoy to do, how you enjoy doing things in general, etc. Then compare them to job descriptions and see what sounds enjoyable.


 He might have also become comfortable to his position as the bread winner of the relationship (for now) and is on a bit of a power trip in terms of his ability to financially control things. I'd think about talking to a relationship therapist if what I'm saying is close to what you think is going on after reading this. 

I'm only 6 months into my current relationship and earn a little more than my girlfriend but it doesn't effect how we talk, argue, or think about each other. We already understand that we're serious and it's not about ""me"" it's already about ""us"". It's our income, our earnings, our happiness, etc. 

The rest is all theory so please ignore if I'm off: It's scary to think about but I would be as confident about your life and goals as he is about his position. I am picturing too many apologies being thrown his direction. Too much nervous body language that he could be seeing and taking advantage of. Put your arms on your hips, stand up straight more, and say you believe in yourself and that even though he earns more than you, you deserve respect anyways. Especially since you're his significant other. Personally, I respect the shit out of my girlfriend and consider her stronger than me but that we're a team and help each other when and where we need it.

communicate with her. tell her that you need physical touch and you’re feeling unloved. tell her it has nothing to do with sex. suggest that she initiate it, so that she doesn’t feel caught off guard given her past trauma. suggest small changes, like holding hands while watching tv or having her feet up on your lap on the couch. start small. if all she thinks you want is sex then honestly i would suggest giving up sex for a month to show her you’re serious. tell her you’re not going to have sex for a month and are serious about the other acts of affection. she needs to understand that this is really important to you and that you are feeling unloved"
rel_30029888,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,132,"Thanks for the comment. Additional details for grocery splitting context:

We typically tell each other when we go to the store and what for. If someone buys something they didn’t previously say they were buying the expectation is they pay for it themselves (usually these other items are for the person buying, i.e I’ll pick up some almonds or kale and pay for them myself because she doesn’t eat either).

On any food related items we share, she has us doing she pays 1/3 and i pay 2/3 because she says i eat more of it than she does (which for the most part is true, she hardly eats much).

Financial context: She makes ~20k gross income more than me a year and lives with me in my house (which I own)."

Very rarely I will agree to ""loan"" money to friends or family, but I try to restrict the amount to something small enough I honestly wouldn't care if I got it back or not.  So in my mind it's a gift, but the other person can repay it if that makes them feel better about it.

I would still be upset if I asked for the money back, or asked for help in return, and someone said ""well you don't really need it"".  It's upsetting to think that the help or assistance only goes one way.  But yes, as a rule of thumb... Never give anyone money if you couldn't afford to just make it a gift."

And you told #3 about #1 and not #2.  #3 starting talking about marriage and kids 8 weeks into the relationship.  And you think that means he really loves you. After he discovered there was a #2, he has started treating you differently and has stopped talking about marriage.  And you think that means something dire.

Have I got that right?

The ""lets see what happens"" is the most level headed thing he could say.  Neither of you knows who the other person is in this short a time.  Too things are going on for both of you:  1. You each are trying to be the person the other one wants.  Normal, healthy biology.  Nothing wrong with that.  It feels really good.  I love new relationship energy (NRE).  2. You each have a fantasy picture of who the other person is and it is that fantasy that is ""perfect"".  Also normal, healthy biology.

It seems like he discovered something that didn't line up with his fantasy picture of you and is slowing things down.  This is very, very healthy.  New relationship energy wears off.  This is why so many relationships and marriages end in 2-3 years.  After NRE wears off you start seeing who the other person really is and all the ways in which you are not compatible for a long relationship.

And as always, the relationship mantra.  Communicate with him.  If you are keeping your worries and concerns to yourself, you are going to have a self-fulfilling set of events.  "

Or even 6 months later when he moved in another girl and it was abundantly clear we weren't together anyone. We were legally seperated almost immediately. And divorced as soon as I could afford it. He wasnt exactly cooperative.  He was an abusive sociopath who would later go to prison for holding a gun to some poor girls head. 

My SO has delt with and come to terms with her behavior but he wants to at least be civil enough to have a relationship with his brother and apparently his mom wasnt like this before. But, to be fair. He didnt give her much opportunity. He only had 2 relationships before me. Both didn't last more than 6 months. Their living situation made it pretty hard to date. They were pretty poor and he shared a room with his brother all of his life and often, their mom slept in the livingroom. So there wasnt much privacy within the home.

rel_36184912,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,366,"Well there's the possible explanation of cultural influence for them seeing her as vulnerable and whatnot, but there's also the possibility Maria is just a conniving people player. From what OP has mentioned, she doesn't take responsibility for her actions, OP's wife has a very kind and compassionate personality that's led to this sort of doormat situation, and Pat sounds to have avoidance issues, which all gather up to mean regardless of cultural influence, Maria sucks lol. She's a manipulator, and I can tell just at a glance because I have an ex who played the same crap on me off and on for four years before I cottoned on and cut her out of my life permanently.

People like Maria are *always* the victim, and anyone who causes them mild discomfort or point out their true shitty self are *always* the abusers. In this scenario, Pat has been with her for so long, he's too entrenched to realize she's a terrible person, but she still has her claws in him so he isn't such a bad guy... *Yet*. But you'll notice OP mentions that Pat wasn't doing so great at the whole taking care of the home and kids, cleaning and whatnot, well. I think I'd be behind on that too if my partner of several decades was acting shady and turned out to be cheating on me as well. The person being cheated on can always tell, even if only subconsciously, and this is a very common blaming tactic cheaters use to give reasons for why they cheated. So, small smear campaign definitely in progress here.

If Maria was remorseful, truly, she'd realize she's disrupting her husband's family, she'd realize that she's causing OP's household strain, and she'd figure out some way to solve that. Given that Pat and OP's wife are fighting so hard for Maria to stay put, yeah, she's definitely got them fooled into thinking she's little miss sweet and innocent who just made a terrible mistake. -eyeroll- For the sake of OP's sanity, I hope they can get their wife and Pat to open their eyes and cut Maria out of their lives, because she's certainly playing them pretty well."

rel_15901180,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,238,"Ok...here’s my take.  

1.  Every time he says he wants a relationship, you should be equating that to a statement saying, “I want you to have sex exclusively with me”.   Because he keeps bringing that up and not respecting that you want to ease into things, that’s a red flag and I would maybe not entertain this much further. 

2.   Following up on that, the exclusive sex thing is the reason why he wants to know if you have guy friends.  He’s assuming that all men think about women the way he thinks about them.  That means any male friend of yours is also trying to have sex with you, which makes them a threat.  This is also a red flag and a sign that if this continues, you won’t be allowed to have male friends anymore.  He will probably also be super controlling of that, so be prepared to handle his paranoia with respect to that.  

3.   He doesn’t seem to view you as a peer, as someone to be respected.   If he did, he wouldn’t pressure you about how much time you’re going to need.  To him, because this is about sex, he doesn’t really need you to take time.  He doesn’t need to learn about you.  He just wants to have sex and to exercise control over you to ensure you only have sex with him.  

I would stay the hell away from this one."

rel_23266659,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,302,"Thats the place where you make it clear that any kind of physical contact that isn't consented to, is 100% a dealbreaker.  You don't fucking dance around dealbreakers.

If getting slapped in the face is a deal breaker you need to take a moment and next time you talk, make it very clear, ""Just so you know, and I know we were just joking around a bit before, but if you ever hit me, in any way, ever, we are done, immediately.""

DON'T PLAY THE GREY AREA/HYPOTHETICAL GAME, WITH PHYSICAL VIOLENCE.  You draw clear lines, remove the joking and at least 1 time, say to his face.  ""If you ever lay your hands on me and slap me, our relationship is over.""

Just make sure he acknowledges that it was said. 

I don't even think he actually is going to slap you around or anything, I think this was a dumbass conversation for a couple young humans in love just had while goofing around, but regardless, do not fuck around with boundaries.

If ALL of your boudaries are not vocalized to the other partner, with the consequence of the relationship being over if the lines are crossed, then you are dumb.

Also just for clarity sake as you are a young person getting into the whole adult relationship world.

Any boundarie or dealbreaker that does not have the implicit result in an immediate ending of the relationship, is a bullshit lie.  A fake boundary and a cowards bluff.  Never move a single inch on your dealbreakers.

Just communicate and judge his reaction and make it clear this isn't a grey zone, or a ""thought experiment"" its you telling him that if you ever were to get slapped it would be the last time you are touched by the person who slapped you."
rel_24995821,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,301,"No problem!

Well obviously if you had a bad breakup and didn't have some kind of agreement outside of a verbal contract he could potentially kick you out without notice and potentially lay claim to furniture and such bought together. I'm not sure exactly of the laws and I'm sure it depends on where you are and such but that would be difficult on top of going through a breakup. 

But as far as while you're together I wouldn't see it as anything specific per se, but it will likely subconsciously weigh in on decisions you may make such as personalizations to the house, furniture, etc. Again, maybe I'm just being extra cautious as someone who has been manipulated in the past, but I feel like it can go from 'this person is not in any way manipulative and I know I can trust them' to 'this person owns/controls everything in my life' without even realizing it's happening. And for me at least, it started with reasonable-sounding decisions like this one. He may very well be a great person, but living together in a setting where you have equal legal control of the situation first could be helpful in knowing that for sure.

Even if you can't fully predict how it will weigh on things in the future, getting a solid foundation of a relationship before integrating things and adding power dynamics like that can be a safer bet I suppose. But we're also not the same people and I'm not saying that's necessarily what's best for you, either. I'm fully aware I'm projecting my own past onto this so it could be completely fine for your situation, but I thought it's still potentially helpful to weigh in with my experiences at least. For reference as well, I'm also a 26F."

There is nothing wrong with wanting to remain friends now that you know. But I think it's important to ask yourself some questions about your relationship with her:


If she was cis, would you want her to be your girlfriend?
Now that you know she's trans, how does that change her as a person?
What is it that's turning you off?
Why is that turning you off? 
Ultimately, what matters more--her as a person, or what's in her knickers?

rel_1739014,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,292,"OK here is what I think. To a certain extent I think he is right. Life is not always exciting. When you are together for a number of years life will settle down and get tedious/routine-ish. This is normal. However, he is taking it to an unhealthy level in being that all he wants to do is be a couch potato lol

There are things couples can do to bring back some excitement, but this requires effort on both parties. It seems like he is perfectly fine being a couch potato. 

Now, having said that, what about going out and exploring some things by yourself? I am not saying break up, or take a break. I am talking about self fulfillment. If he won't do things with you, make it a point to go do them alone. Get that excitement you need and see if that helps. Before you protest, yes I am aware that it would be great if you guys did such things together, but since right now he seems adamant on a boring life, I say try it alone. 

The reason I am giving this advise is because its clear you love him and want to work it out. Perhaps if he sees that you are having such a great time alone, and living life to its fullest, he might eventually want to be a part of that. 

As time goes by if he doesn't come around, you can at that point decide if you wish to stay or go. But at least you tried to live your life and make it exciting. I want to add that there is nothing wrong with doing things on your own, its actually vital to have a life outside of your relationship. "

&gt;It takes courage to bring up some issues in a relationship, especially when it comes to sex. Instead of trying to be understanding and be empathic to her BF's point of view, OP's first response was to call him rude and unempathetic. OP then gave him an ultimatum, saying, ""if it's a deal-breaker, leave."" (A very mature response).

We are not discussing sex preference here. We are discussing boundary made because of a trauma. She made it clear from the start she would never perform it. Him bringing it up like this triggered her, which explains her response. People are free to break up for any reason and if she is scared for her mental health and well being she is free to break up with him. 
If receiving bj is more important to him than his gf wellbeing then they are not compatible anymore. It is not a big deal, people broke up eventually. That's tough but they will get over it with times.

&gt;Edit: If her PTSD is so bad she can't handle a discussion about sex, she should be in therapy, not a relationship.

Well that's good because that is exactly where she stands right now : not in a relationship and in therapy."

It really boils down to do you want to be with her?

She’s had an emotional affair, which is bad. Only you know whether you can get over that. 

She feels emotionally abused by you. You would have to really work on that if you want to stay together because she feels how she feels. (And if you ask me, that packing your suitcase so she’d beg you to stay bit was super manipulative and immature)

You should absolutely work out your feelings in therapy. But you’re only half of this decision. If you were to decide you could get over the emotional affair and work on changing yourself, she would still have to want to be with you. It’s not solely your decision. And therapy will help you understand that as well.

In my personal experience, I was harassed as a minor, it stopped when I came of adult age (some harassers were grown men). That's not the issue in OP's post, he only said that his GF was looked at, nothing about verbal abuse or hand gestures in the post.

That still doesn't mean that people looking at me is harassment. I'm also bisexual, I have ogled men and women alike. My husband and I have checked out women together. Am I a predator too now? People with working vision will look at people and things they find pleasing.

He'd chatter about his day (which was basically the same thing every day)  ask about mine and so on. Then day after day it got annoying that I would leave for work and return  and see him in the same spot with the same non events etc.

 I quietly resented him for not working, I would zone out to try and find some sort of peace because I'm tired of mentally balancing bills to keep afloat, can no longer buy things I could normally afford, etc   and I know if I said something he would get defensive and feel like crap because he wasnt working. 

And that would be another thing to deal with.  Yet he would have an attitude that he wasn't the center of my universe .

rel_18113995,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,105,"It feels like the anger is hiding some insecurity. You said in comments she is shy about sex. Couldn’t it be that she fears that sex toy represent a side of you she can’t satisfy? From her perspective, you had a sex toy you two could use together, and you kept it from her. More, you thought about using it with your ex back then. Maybe this made her wonder if there was a side of you you are holding back from her. And if this is somethings she feels it’s too much for her to handle, maybe she’s afraid to be letting you down."

Match her energy when it comes to texting. If she’s not texting you first, or sending long messages, do the same. If she seems open to have good conversation via text while you’re both at work, go for it. Typically, people give what they want to receive, so it’s always good to pay attention to the amount of time and attention they’re giving you, so you can give it back to them. Does that make sense?"

So guys my girlfriend of 2 year’s wants me to convert my religion of Orthodoxy and become a Muslim to marry her. 

She is adamant that now 2 years is long enough and it has come a time that if i want this relationship to go further i must accept and convert to Islam.

I know her family has got into her ears a about this and it’s really bothering me as I’ve told her before that religion should not come in between 2 people that are in love. I told her no one should judge us and only God should be the judge of what we decide but she said if i want to be with her i must become Muslim.

We are not planning on having kids so that is no issue there but i do come front a strict Orthodox religion myself as all my family does. I am not religious myself in the way i live my life but i am a believer of God &amp; really don’t want to change my religion for any one. I believe if you love someone you shouldn’t try and change them for who they are and what they’re beliefs are.

She comes from a middle eastern background and myself from a European background. I need your advice please guys

Thank you"
rel_11699126,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,142,"Listen, I had a lot of people commenting on the “only one month of dating, and you want to spend the rest of your life with him”. So let me clarify some things. I have been single by choice for 5 years. I have been hurt, several times. I have dated, had flings, had FWBs, etc. I end things because they either don’t feel right, we are complete opposites, they aren’t what I want, etc. I have stayed single for 5 years, to find the right person. I feel like he is the right person, which is why I’m super hopeful and optimistic. But along with being hopeful and optimistic, I am also realistic. I know there is a chance that things may not work, and life happens. But I still have hope and want things to work out more than anything."
rel_22338026,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,239,"
I think at least a conversation is in order.  I can see wanting her own nest egg...not because she’s concerned about the relationship but...just in case. I had my own retirement accounts when we got married, and my own brokerage, and savings and all, and even after a decade, still maintain a few pots of money separately.  I’m a saver, he is not, it works for us. 

She may not have a specific plan for the money other than having some put aside.  I think opening her own IRA with an auto deposit every month into a nice, no fee mutual fund would go a long way into making her feel heard.  While it’s slowly trickling in, she can read up on investment strategies, get an understanding of what the terms mean, and write out her investment philosophy.  If she wants to change the direction of her funds, she can. And if she decides that she’s ok with a conservative 80/20 split that’s going to slowly accumulate, it’s already set up. 

I’d also take the time to go through your accounts and make sure they’re in both your names and beneficiaries are correctly attributed to each account. Do this with her, so she understands it’s family money, and she feels the ownership. 

I totally get that the free money from your 401K is the most attractive offer.  But a happy marriage where everyone feels heard and respected is priceless."
rel_10642987,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,138,"It would be an easy and maybe commonplace mistake if it was something minor, like asking for him to pass the salt and referring with the wrong name, not while fucking. It might happen easily and often to you but don't make sweeping statements like that.



Not to mention that she did that a short while after they met him, the constant thought of her maybe not being over her ex might nag him forever. He doesn't get the luxury of being a third party that she has no reason to lie to. Add to the fact that it was a full on sentence and that their names don't match and I would be really reluctant to try working on this.

rel_36234266,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,348,"You should just move on. A guy that says things like that doesn't present any constructive instructions.

I know it hurts but the feelings that you're are undatable are not true. There are so many good things about you that he overlooked and it was quite cruel of him to do what he did. Better for him to show his true colors now than lwter down the line. And perhaps there's someone more compassionate, someone better fitted for you who doesn't see you as some kind of trophy but as an actual human being who can mess up every now and then, or who needs help carrying out day to day tasks. Maybe the problem wasn't you, it was him. Maybe you do need improvement. At the end of the day, the standards shouldn't be double - you wouldn't have needed to parent a grown ass man like him either. And in society's perspective where women are often expected to be the caretakers and homemakers, you wouldnt have needed to take care of him either. Where the relationship was once mutual, I'm assuming you've had taken care of him. That counts for something and it's likely he's projecting on you. Get rid of the ungrateful cunt. His arrogance, ""best years"" and ""grown woman"", so much misogyny just bleeds from his tone, rudeness, and plain cruelty it's quite a spectacle that so many people are siding with someone who says something so cruel, so uncompassionate in what was once a mutual relationship. Speaks for the women who try to rip other women down. But in any case, now you have time for you. You can be your loving yourself, freely, without his cruelty. I feel that you are somewhat codependent on him that you can find no error within him besides his bluntness. Perhaps that's just your heart shielding you from the truth, that he's more cruel than he seems."

rel_23908731,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,250,"I appreciate your reply! 

I love the metaphor about the diminishing marginal utility and agree. We both have put a lot of time and effort into trying to make it work to the point where it’s drained us. 

I probably should have mentioned this in the original post but the conclusion he got from the time he went MIA was that he wanted to get married to me and wanted the relationship to move in that direction and needed to know if I would be dating him with that in mind as well since I had mentioned to him before that at the age I am now, I didn’t want to get married yet. I decided to keep going with the relationship since he was not rushing me to get married now but wanted to make sure it was headed in that direction eventually. 

I had also brought up multiple times that his need for assurance was making me feel rushed to be in the same place he is, but we seem to always come back to this. I can’t speak on his behalf but I’m assuming it’s because he really wants us to be on the same level and moving forward. 

I wholeheartedly agree on your last statement. We have been putting too much into the small things and not looking at the big picture. I can only really work on what I can control at this point so this is something I am striving to be better at."

rel_29430987,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,255,"&gt;When deep down he isn't happy himself and I can tell. Why does he not want me to leave?

So, you know the old situation where a toddler doesn't seem to like his toy but if you take the toy away he'll throw a temper tantrum?

Same situation here. To him, you are his property-no more than a toy to be played with. And even though he doesn't seem to like his toy, the thought of losing his toy turns him into a bratty child. This is not normal. This is not healthy. This is not okay. 

Just. Dump. Him.

Leave. Don't give him the chance to speak. Say nothing to him. Get up and leave. Go to a friends' house, a relatives' house with your son (or, if all else fails, a shelter). Tell him you are no longer a couple once you are gone. If he starts sending you abusive messages, save all of them-that way if a custody battle arises you can use them as evidence. 

You are not a toy to be played with. You are not a mother to an overgrown bratty manchild. You deserve better than this. Your child deserves better than this. A child should grow up knowing that mothers and fathers should love and respect one another. Children should not have to grow up thinking that fathers keeping mothers as hostages and controlling their lives is ""normal"" and ""acceptable"". Children should not grow up watching their mothers sink into depression because of how cruel their fathers are."

I want us to set ourselves up for a great time so I wanted to check with you to see what we can do to make that happen. I’m happy to bring a white board or something but wanted to check to see if you have any recommendations or what works best for you”. 

Always phrase accommodations  as things you do together to make it work and not as things you do for her. She may read lips and not want you to bring a dry erase board. Your sweet intentions might come off in a way that embarrasses her. They may not. My brother is legally blind and it drives him nuts when people try to assume how to help him.

rel_35923648,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,431,"So he cheated and lied. Knocked the girl up and lied. Abandoned his child and lied. Had the child he abandoned die and lied... and his whole family knew about ALL of this and ALSO LIED? Oh, and he's an alcoholic who nursed his drinking habit rather than take responsibility for any of this.



You are in the rare position of knowing someone is a cheating, lying, deadbeat dad *before* having a kid with him. It would be cruel to being a baby into this world with a father like that 

Throughout every twist and turn he put himself first. When he cheated. When he refused to be involved with his child. When he kept the truth about the child and his abandonment if that child a secret. When he cut his family off. When he drank like an asshole. And now, when he tells you about the kid so he can feel the relief of grieving openly... for a child he refused to be involved with. 

In *his* version of this you're mad and disappointed, but you take pity on him because his affair baby died. You're upset and betrayed but realize he's changed and he's not rhe same man he was when he cheated. You acknowledge he's clean now and experiencing something difficult so you put your hurt and anger aside to comfort him. He doesn't deserve to be punished when he's changed so much and he's already suffered the loss of a baby. A baby he abandoned for the sake of his marriage. Because he loves you. Just *so* much.

In *reality* he is a lying cheater who has prioritized his wants over his child, his marriage, and his family. He's so selfish that he betrayed his wife, betrayed his affair partner, betrayed his child, and betrayed his family of origin all because it'd be inconvenient for him to suffer the consequences for getting his dick wet 3 years into his marriage by a woman who is not his wife.

It's up to you what you do... but staying married and/or having kids with this dude is clearly, *clearly* a mega-fuck-ton infinity elephant ass bad idea... and you don't even have the excuse of ignorance. 

You'd be making that decision with literally all of the information telling you it's a bad-fuck idea.

You should tell your family. If they're not complete wackos they'll see how absurd it is to even consider staying with this loser and knock some goddamn sense into you. 

Oh, and don't ever let it slip your mind that his family *also* can't be trusted."
rel_38821763,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,240,"Lots of people here are saying you respected her right to autonomy and talking about consent. It’s not that simple. She asked you to be her advocate, to be her conscience and when the time came you said zilch instead of “are you sure, I don’t want you to regret the decision”. Yes it’s confusing and it will have been really stressful, and I’m not saying you did the wrong thing. But she can’t go back and change that decision and she’s angry and I’ll guarantee she’s mad at herself as well as you. Her birth experience isn’t what she hoped for and she has to grieve that. 

My advice is apologise for not advocating for her the way she asked you to. Explain that it was bad (which I interpret to mean it was very scary and stressful for you to see her in so much pain) and so you didn’t want to stand in the way of her having what she needed in the moment. That you wish she could have had the birthing experience she wanted but that you’re so grateful that both her and the baby are healthy and whole and your so proud of her for doing it. 

It may feel like it’s all coming from you saying that, but she just birthed a human. Right now is the time to make that concession and get on with being parents to a beautiful baby. 

Congratulations."

About three years ago we moved in together when we went away to college and it was tough to get used to. we were fighting about a lot of little things all of the time. we both decided that counseling would be the best bet to help our relationship. we went together first and our counselor suggested that we each do separate counseling to work out things individually first. My boyfriend has AHDH( anxiety problems that lead to anger) so he needed to work that out and get it under control. (that was a big part of our fighting) after a month or so of going individually we went to a whole new counselor together to work on the rest of our fighting. She gave us great tips about learning what love language we each have and how to give each other the love we need the most. for example he needs words of affirmation and mine was something like showing affection. In the end, it helped us out soooo much. It was a really great experience for us. we learned how to talk to each other instead of fighting and yelling at each other. It also helped my boyfriend realize that he needed meds to help him control his ADHD. We are still together today and doing very well with our relationship.

I actively sought them out because boys my age were “immature”.

My dad said nothing, that was almost worse. 

Once my mum was done with me and I got sent to my room, my dad came up. 

He sat down with me and treated me like an adult. He had a conversation with me about how other girls my age had done the same before. He showed me case studies. He told me he wasn’t angry, he was just disappointed with me not talking to him. 

He said that boys my age might be immature but at least they were unable to kidnap me. We spoke for hours and by the end of it I was crying again, not from being degraded, but because someone sat me down and spoke to me like an adult and explaining to me why what I was doing was dangerous.

You invested three years in this relationship and at no point it was really great for long if i see this right? Maybe in the beging when yoj were in the honeymoon phase? 

In LDR people project their dreams and hopes to the other person, the expectations get so high. And the frustration if the meeting isn't like you hoped for is crushing you. 

A relationship needs so much more as love. And why should YOU work on yourself when HE got the problem with getting aggressiv? You can't do his work like therapy for him. That you even think it is just your fault and just you need to change...

You should go concentrate on therapy. And if you feel better look for a partner that lives close by. LDR is not for everybody."
rel_33260548,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,279,"My bf was a single dad for 5 years before he met me and was definitely looking for a relationship. He hooked up with a couple of ladies but none of them he really connected with. When he and I had our first date he expected nothing of it. In fact he was kinda already seeing this other chick (I had no knowledge of this, he didn’t tell me about her until we’d been dating for 8 months) but when he and I were seeing each other for one or two weeks he knew he wanted me to be his girlfriend and he asked me to be exclusive.
(Again I had no knowledge of this other girl and I should have asked him about it. Then again I might have broken it off…)
In other words he wasn’t completely smitten with me after our first meetup/date, it took him a couple of weeks to get to know me. 
This stung a bit…. i thought we were both into each other since day 1. I felt so ugly when he confessed.

But I gave it some time. He tells me he loves me every day. His love language is acts of service and yesterday he fixed my bike for me. He calls me every day how my day was. We’re both almost 40 so we’re older and more established and know what we want from each other.

If she *really* wants to be friends after the breakup, she's going to have to give you as much time as you need and want to get over the loss of the romantic relationship first, and if you end up deciding that you don't want to be friends with her after that? That's fine. You get to make that decision for yourself."
rel_30947246,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,242,"When I got divorced (I initiated it due to financial infidelity by my ex-wife), I felt like an immense failure.  I could not rebuild the trust I had in my ex-wife.  I could not save my marriage.  I carried a ton of anger and guilt around inside of me.

Your feelings make sense.  It is often said that infidelity can take 5 or 10 years to get over and even then it's forgiven, not forgotten.  Your wife did something that leaves an indelible mark on your marriage, but is seemingly over it after just 2 years.

Of course, logically, she cannot atone forever; that's not fair to either one of you.  Ultimately, you have to decide if you want to continue to put in your work (to rebuild trust) and to ask her to do the same.  You do not own her anything.  Let me repeat that:  You do not owe her anything.  Your vows were broken the day she cheated and you are not ready to offer her new ones.  That's okay.

The ball is in your court, but for your own mental well being, it's time to move beyond ""try"" and decide if you want this woman in your life long term or not.  Either answer is acceptable.  If you want her in your life, then consider what you need from her -- whether its punitive or angled to restoring more trust.  It may be time for more counseling sessions."

He rudely said happy birthday, but I ignored him, focusing on watching (interestingly enough) a You Tube video on how to deal with a potential narcissist/emotional abuser. He was irritable and said he got me flowers, and I calmly replied I don't want them or anything from him. I told him to please leave the bedroom because I was doing something, and he should respect that. He has been sulking ALL day, and covertly/calmly says he was really sorry, but I was to blame too. He says he wants to talk tomorrow,not about ""us"", but our ""situation""-i.e. our living ""situation"".

You’re only as sick as your secrets.  Honestly, your gf’s game plan is just going to lead to a big giant elephant in the room that gets bigger and bigger.  

I personally think people have fantasies about what having a child will be like and you are very pragmatic/realistic.  Even after the kids are born people will insist on how much they love it (on fb) meanwhile when you’re with them your skin just wants to crawl off bc they are so tense and miserable.  But on fb - its all about how much they love it and pictures by the pumpkin patch and sandcastles at the beach.  

It’s like a form of virtue signaling too - look at how great and selfless I am bc I had children your life is so small compared to mine

I have two kids and I regret it.  This world sucks and I’m sad for bringing them into it.  Wouldn’t do it again; got remarried and it wasn’t even on the table to do it again.  Love my kids but feel like I was the victim of crazy lies and propaganda about what it would be like. "

Still impacts him to this day - 30 years later.  Likewise I have a cousin that learned his Mom had 2 previous biological children that he never knew about when he was in his 20's and has messed him up badly.  

Based on this history, I've always talked about my being adopted with my kids, not in a ""you need to know"" way, but just as in ""oh, I can relate to that"" when something about adoption came up or something similar.  Seriously about a month ago my teen said ""What?  You're adopted?!?!"" and my older daughter piped in with something like ""yeah, you knew that you just never paid attention"".  She explained she'd heard it all her life but there was one day when it dawned on her what we'd talked about previously and that's what just happened to my teen.  But there was no feeling of betrayal and being lied to.  I don't know that you can casually drop it into a conversation at this point, but maybe it doesn't have to be a big ""reveal"".

Also, I don't know if this has been mentioned in any previous replies, but my oldest daughter about a year ago did one of those genetic tests.  There were a lot of matches with family members of my biological father's family and she asked my husband and I who they were since she'd never heard of them.  I explained and that was that.

Both girls have always been told that they are welcome to reach out to any of these biological relatives if they so choose.  It's just something I've always opted not to do so even though they've asked to develop a relationship with me much of my life.  (I don't know if that was the right or fair decision to do to them, but that's another conversation).

Sorry this is so long, I just wanted to share my experience in a similar situation in case it's helpful to you in coming to a decision."

And when you get older, I'd suggest having some tall tales about how it happened when talking to women.

""What happened to my eye?  Well, when they say don't climb over the fence at the zoo, they mean it.  *Especially* at the crocodile exhibit.""

""They asked what I'd do for a Klondike Bar."" (this may be too old a reference for you)

With a very serious face, ""Never play Fortnite in VR.""

rel_30515566,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,239,"It depends. Roleplay (RP) in MMOs means different things to different people. Some use it to meet people in real life (RL), others use it to experiment with different sexes or states of being or beliefs or all sorts of things. Some do it just to make platonic friends, or to be part of a larger community. Some do it to be involved in stories. And some do it as a form of porn that they have no intention of carrying over into RL. I don’t know which of these it is, for your partner.

Caution areas are where a RPer can’t or has difficulty separating RL from IC (in-character) communication. Some people just have a really hard time with this, where others have no problems at all. 

He’s playing a female, when he’s male, so that makes it a lot less likely this is any intent to cheat, bc after all, in RL he’s not female. 

So with all of what I’ve said, I think it comes down to whether or not you are comfortable with him participating in ERP (erotic roleplay). Like porn in general, this can be a divisive area for couples. Obviously, if he’s trying to make an in-game connection that he wants to turn into a RL thing behind your back, that would be pretty problematic.. but my sense is that this isn’t likely… though I don’t know for sure.

I hope this helps!"
rel_34533969,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,300,"The entire basis of any relationship worth having is mutuality.

Think about what it means to love someone. At least to me, the biggest point here is that the flourishing and happiness of someone I love slips into the same tier of importance as my own flourishing and happiness.

So, the dangerous thing here is to stop there and conclude that you can just destroy yourself to bring somebody you love joy and live off the joy you're giving them. What doing this fails to consider is that ***if somebody loves you, your flourishing and happiness become essential to them as well.***

This means that, if you want your relationship to be a positive experience for the person you're having it with, you need to acknowledge your own needs and desires. In a loving relationship, prioritising yourself, being selfish in certain ways, is a duty, because your own suffering affects your partner.

\---

I'm not saying you have to be selfish to the exclusion of all else. What I'm saying is that, if looking at your relationship through a selfish lens, specifically looking at how it affects you, it seems like a net negative, the relationship is doomed, or at least not worth sticking with.

Because you end up with two options:

Either:

your partner knows this/learns about it/you tell them, and if they actually love you they'll want you to leave because they don't want to affect you that way. Because they know that they're hurting you, the entire relationship turns into self harm because hurting you is hurting themself.

Or:

You successfully deceive them so they don't notice what's going on, thereby destroying the foundation of what you have, because your partner now doesn't have a relationship with you anymore, but with a fictional character that doesn't exist."

What I’m wondering at this point is are you sure you’re still together? If you are, I suggest couples counseling for both of you.  

Whether or not you’re staying together, you should begin anger management therapy or abuser-focused therapy (not because I think you necessarily are an abuser at this point, but bc some of your behaviors that led to the police being called are similar to abusive behaviors, and it wouldn’t hurt to get help focused on that).

He left because he realized he had a lot of things he needed to work out on his own, and didn't want to drag you through that.

I've been separated from my husband for about a month, and something that I've come to realize is in the last 7 years that we've been together I had become so dependent on him, the attention and affection that he gave me, and everything else that came with that relationship that I lost myself. I lost the person that I am, and I'm struggling with the inner turmoil of focusing on myself and fixing what I need to fix, and just wishing he would take me back.

This is not going to be easy, and you are going to have your good days and your bad. But just know he didn't leave you for any other reason besides what he stated. He probably sees you as a strong perfect person and while he's going through whatever it is he's going through he didn't want to take you down with him. I know that sounds selfish, even cowardly, but sometimes in order to fix something within yourself, you have to detach from someone else first.

And why would she want to change when - in her mind - it gives her an excuse to behave as badly as she wants until she gets her own way?

Right now it's not playing female characters, then it will be not playing *alongside* female characters, then female gamers will need to go, then the game itself.

I am really sorry that you had to experience these false accusations and harassment. It is good at least that your name cleared up.

He would take his job seriously so as not to get fired, or, if he did get sacked then he would be trying to find a way to replace that income immediately. 

Aside from this, I would also consider the people you want to enter into relationships with in the future. Some people don't take work seriously or don't mind bouncing from job to job, and as much as there is nothing wrong with that and that is fine if that is what they want, it won't work out for you if you are unable or unwilling to carry the burden of their financial situation or if you are someone who is fiscally responsible and passionate/ambitious.

My advice would be not to mention what you saw directly, and do not try and create a scene to match.

Instead engage your wife ask her if she is satisfied with her (your) sex life, if she wants to try anything etc... Bring a suggestion to of your own as well for spicing things up.

Your wife may just want to spice things up, but doesn't know how to do so. So she is reading erotic stories. Talk to her about sex and try and try some new things. 

Open and honest conversations about needs and desires is needed without judgement. But start slow,  ease her (and yourself) into the conversation, don't start by buying a latex gimp suit.

You asking how you can help doesn’t mean she gives you a laundry list of ways you can make her feel more appreciated. I’m talking a code word or a phrase; “You’re doing the thing”.

We fell out of touch a long time ago, got briefly back in touch over FB, and like your ex, he wasn't doing too well. We again fell out of touch, and a few years ago, some mutual friends contacted me to let me know he'd taken his own life. He'd been in a bad way for a long time, struggling with mental illness and his unfortunate upbringing. I was very sad about that, despite not having any lingering romantic feelings for him. He was a human I once cared about very much and he deserved better from life.

Don't blame yourself for anything your ex is going through. She sounds like she has mental illness and had it even before you two got together. It has nothing to do with you, and it's important to remember that you also can't ""save"" her from her issues. She needs professional help, not an old flame.

rel_23062478,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,228,"A good relationships is like 2 pillars leaning on one another and will build the other up. Sometimes one will need the other more and Vice versa. My bf manages to melt my anxiety the second I see him and I do the same for him. We have one another’s back and tell one another daily how much we appreciate the other and why. We both have flaws but we are human and those flaws and past mistakes give us patience and empathy. We made it clear from the get go that if/ when we argue, we are fighting for one another not fighting each other. We never bring up old arguments and never hit below the belt. We have been together over a year and see eye to eye on just about everything. It is about giving and taking. We also have stuck to our promise to never assume the other can read the other’s mind so when we say we are fine, we are really fine. No mind games, no passive aggressive bs. But it took years of bad relationships to learn to be in a healthy one and to lay out what we expect from one another. I fall more in love with him every day and we put in the work to show we care and pay attention to the others wants and needs."

rel_26495348,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,349,"He is at the very least gaslighting you and at the most cheating on you. Let's be generous and say he isn't cheating on you, which seems unlikely to me, he is gaslighting you by making you think that you are crazy for being worried by these revelations. Any normal person who wasn't trying to gaslight you would recognize and acknowledge that these photos are concerning and that you have a very valid reason to be concerned. 

The fact that he is trying to tell you you are overreacting and rolling his eyes at you and minimizing this is gaslighting. The fact that he is gaslighting is a concern in itself. Not only because it's gaslighting but if he wasn't cheating on you why would he be gaslighting. 

You at the very least need to have a conversation with him and stand up for yourself and call out the gaslighting and tell him you have valid reasons to be concerned he is cheating on you and what this means for the relationship. There needs to be at minimum answers for you. I think the best way to do this is to talk to the coworker as well as his other coworkers to verify if he's actually telling the truth. There need to be boundaries that you are allowed to read whatever communication he has with her and that the communication is kept to a certain channel you are allowed to read. And that if he crosses these boundaries the relationship is over. That is of course if he's not cheating on you which I think there is a good chance he is giving the way he is reacting to your concerns and gaslighting. 

If that's the case I would reccomend getting a lawyer and withdrawing your finances before you say anything about the divorce and leaving him. 

I'm sorry this happened to you. I caught my wife cheating on me in January of this year. I got a lawyer and arranged the finances and packed up while she was at work and never spoke to her again. 

Good luck."
rel_28270557,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,193,"I’m sorry for the pain you’re going through. Heartbreak can be devastating and has such long lasting effects. I’m also sorry that you encountered crappy therapists because it can make things even more disheartening.
I want you to be able to move on in a healthy way though, with or without him. Ask yourself if you would ever let go of a perfect, loving relationship because of distance, like he did. Perhaps things were more one sided than you realize. Also, it sounds like you’ve already lost him, at least romantically. So I’d encourage you to tell him how you truly feel. It doesn’t have to be in a desperate or needy way. It can just be direct, concise and truthful. Because having him in your life as a friend, I’m not sure that it benefits you in any way. It’s come to the point where the two of you can get back together, or make a clean break and move on. What you’re doing to yourself is just pure torture.

rel_18131126,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,226,"When it comes to secrets, many people don’t consider telling their close family as disclosing someone else’s personal information. It sounds like she vents about you to her mom without realizing that it will still effect you. I think it’s okay to talk about a friend’s situation to a close family member when you are absolutely certain that it will not affect their opinion of said friend, and that they understand if you say anything unsavory it’s because you’re venting. Unfortunately, it sounds like her mom may have taken what Marley has told her to heart, and it’s ended up negatively impacting you. 

If it were me, I would bring it up in conversation, and just be honest with how you feel. It’s possible that she didn’t think of how telling those things to her mom would negatively impact you, but it’s also possible that she could become defensive. If her friendship is important to you, I do think it’s best to bite the bullet and confront her with as much kindness as you can. (Confronting with any anger or aggressions ALWAYS backfires, but if she sees you’re genuinely hurt, she may be more prone to listening). 
If it does backfire, then you know that you’ll just have to have a more shallow relationship with her, as much as I hate to say it. Good luck!"
rel_19304720,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,273,"yeah that would be good if youre okay with that, i may be able to give some more direct advice if thats what you needi apologise for saying he was more suited- i meant as in they may have more in common than she had in common with you, hence they may get along more, but please try to remember that you are not alone, but i understand why you feel so upset, and im sorry that youre feeling like that, but it will pass eventually

she may have found you attractive, but she may also have been using you, neither i, nor you are her so we will probably never know, however we can try to figure it out. but my question is, would you want to be with someone who was using you or didnt find you attractive? im assuming probably not so if the latter is true and she didnt find you attractive and was using you then its a good thing you arent in the relationship now, as it means you cant be used anymore, and in that sense, you are free.

if she was using your insecurities to get to you then she isnt worth it, and i think you may know that as you said you dont understand why you are the one hurting, if you gave more to the relationship than she did then this means that youre the better.try and accept your feelings, and understand them, i think youre the one hurting because you did really like her, and shes gone now, thats normal, itll go away one day, just give yourself time to grieve"
rel_35965,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,315,""" most of my friends who I went with when I first got sober all now have their own circle of sober friends and I feel like I can't break into it"" -- call them and invite them out to stuff. do this enough and they will start inviting you.

AA is weird and cult-like, but it can be useful.  Maybe go to some meetings in the bad part of town to scare yourself straight again.  

As someone with a drinking problem, not caring about your sobriety is a way to not care about yourself. I know it might not seem like that, but the fact is that you basically don't care about your own future right now, you just wanna get out of your present.  I'm sorry, but that's a shitty deal and a crappy spot to be in.  There's not a good way out of this situation. 

being a teetotaler and trying to date / dealing with my best friend's death, i understand the mental conflicts you can have when you're like ""a normal person would just have a drink"" or ""eh, just one isn't going to kill me..""  but the fact is that this is how bad things get started, and booze makes you slide down the slippery slope even faster.  Remembering hangovers, puking, mistakes and the way other people act when drinking is something that helps get rid of the shiny allure of booze.  It is romanticized in our society and media, but it's the same stuff that contributes to homelessness, domestic violence and more.

I applaud the strength you have had to stay clean and sober for so long already.  that does mean that you do have the strength to keep it up on your own.  Reddit is not a substitute for real life connections and friendships -- go out there and work it.  Build up a bigger support network. "

I mean, you felt the need to mention it right up top, so it doesn't seem like you *really* want it to be taken out of the equation.

&gt; girls that complain time after time that their men never want to spend time with them

&gt; In my experience, a guy who games is more likely to be home when you are, battling away to get their next mob drops or ranking up their kill score

So...not spending time with their partner. You're talking about women complaining that their partners don't spend time with them but are encouraging them to date someone who is entirely focused on a game and only willing to interact with them if they pull up and watch?

I have no issue dating a man who plays video games and I have no negative feelings toward them as a hobby, but this entire post reads as you trying to be The Cool Girl who is defending poor, misunderstood gamer guys against evil females so that you can get points for not being like the other girls.

Sorry to be harsh, but you're being pretty unkind about women in this post too so I think a little reality might help.

A lot of people I deal/work with have provided me with proof of their vaccination and still wear their masks (without me asking), because they are aware of what’s been going on not just with “society” but me and my family as well. I still use caution, and especially in public because there are places where restrictions aren’t being followed (like “25% capacity”, “fully vaccinated areas” that are at 100% capacity and such). 

But his mentality shifted somewhere and now it’s like “it’s no big deal”, and we are still ask risk lol…

I know I sound like a paranoid person, but, I can only trust the people I can trust… there are still cases here… and nearly everyone is acting like it’s over with or it never happened in the first place. Even people like my neighbors who lost two new born babies who contracted the virus and still refuse to wear masks, practice social distancing or have their vaccines done. Those kind of people are all over the place… which is why we locked ourselves in the house for a whole year and still act with caution even now. 😔"

rel_1202330,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,234,"&gt; i[f] she hasn't how doesn't she know for sure she is asexual if she doesn't even know what its like

How do you know you're not gay if you've never tried blowing a guy? How do you know you're straight if you've never had sex with a girl? How do you know you're not into horses if you've never... You see my point. This girl knows who she is right now. Take her word for it, and don't ask her to experiment ""to make sure"" or whatever. You won't be able to change her mind. 

True, she may change eventually, since female sexuality seems to be more fluid than male sexuality for whatever reason. But you won't be the one to change her, and you shouldn't try. She'll change on her own, or not. And if you find out in a couple years that she's been sexual with someone else, don't take it personally. 

Even if you do somehow convince her to consent to making out or even having sex, you'd know that she's trying something she really doesn't have any interest in doing. Would you really want to be in that position with a girl?

It sounds like you two are mismatched. Perhaps you should find a girl who is interested in a physical relationship with you. Otherwise you might start to resent this girl for something that is not her fault."
rel_15442983,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,282,"There are pharmacists that supposedly will forge you received the shot with in fact you bought it and it was thrown unused in the bin.

I'm not advocating avoiding the shot. But why not just lie to your mother? Say you talked about your issue with a friend, you went together, bought the shots, had it destroyed and got the paperwork.

Even better go get it. Tell your mother you hatched a plan with a friend, they wanted the shot but couldn't afford it, so they posed as you, got the shot. Done. Get a friend to lie for you if she wants to question said friend.

If she pushes, got offended, that's what people do when they are telling the truth. Then get angry, reverse, play victim, storm off.

Pout and keep hammering on about how upset you are for being called a liar. You worked out the best way to get it sorted and nothing will make her happy. Your tired of being the punching bag. Then get her to apologise and move on 

Yes this is manipulative. Let's be honest with this state of affairs, no come to Jesus, no heart to heart, no bit of logic is going to sort this.

rel_32385922,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,223,"Honestly, if you don’t want to make anything from a potential relationship then there’s no reason or point to tell him. If you were already in the process of distancing yourself then telling him would only add more trauma and stress to YOUR life/experience. We have all come to rely upon the “others” perspective, but you need to do what makes you feel like your living your best life, and you’re one that’s in control of that. If you told him, he could be the type that would be really angry and resentful that you made that choice, casting blame and guilt when the reality is that the choice is yours and yours alone and you don’t deserve to be humiliated and shamed. What if he begged you to keep it and promises the world? You know. It doesn’t fit in the narrative of the life you’re trying to create for yourself. Do you. Stay strong. And fuck his potential feelings on the subject.. 

And also, while it does suck to be ghosted (trust me it has happened to me more than I’d like to admit) it’s become a pretty normal way for people to terminate friendships or potential relationships.. contacting him again when you don’t want anything else to evolve will only invite unwanted attention or create more stress in your lives."

He tries to play you with the whole relationship/ “you’re mature for your age” bull then tell him to introduce you to his coworkers, his family, AND the people in his community as his girlfriend. That motherfucker will ghost you and act like he doesn’t know you before ever considering doing that. Why? Because he knows what he is doing is wrong."

Although it's a serious matter, I can see this as a huge lapse in judgement on his part, but that alone doesn't make him a horrible person. It's up to you whether you should throw away the relationship based on this action. 
My gf and I are causal users. She once snuck me some when I was stressed. I felt it and was like also mad she did that, mainly since I had to drive to my parents after. We talked and it was a learning moment. Every situation is different. Just my 2 cents."
rel_12106884,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,219,"Thank you for helping me see through your perspective. 

Having experienced the loss of my beautiful marriage, it’s had me wondering about the value of marrying again someday. I’m all for a wonderful monogamous relationship, but marriage? I don’t know. I see the value for young families raising kids, but not so sure once past that point. 

I’ve heard of people that had excellent decades-long partnerships that became ruined after they married. Getting married sometimes changes a relationship in not the best ways. 

From what I’ve seen of couples, I don’t think that just because people get married, they commit to working harder on the relationship. Actually the opposite may be true. People may relax, having caught the other person, and now they don’t make as much of an effort to nourish the relationship. 

I can’t say anything to family accepting you, as an unmarried partner. There is that. For other aspects, you can be unmarried with an Advanced Health Directive that empowers you to be there in times of medical need. Also hospitals don’t ask for proof of who you are when visiting, and they may honor domestic partners. 

It sounds like he doesn’t want to marry. Perhaps he’s having a hard time seeing what the benefit would be?

It also sounds like marriage is something you crave."

2. As for him possibly being a pedo, again, you're 19, almost 20.  Nothing illegal there.   Just out of curiosity, does he know how old you are? (I'm assuming he does since you know his age).
3. The age difference is a bit high, but nothing I would consider super creepy.  Age is really just a number after a certain point anyway.  It's really about maturity level.  Maybe you're mature for your age, or he's immature for his (or a little of both so you meet in the middle).  Either way, that's the thing to watch out for with the age gap.
4. If you do decide to meet him, I do have a couple of recommendations.  Make sure it's in a public place with lots of people (and during daylight hours, if possible).  Maybe for the first meet bring a friend you trust that's willing to follow you at a distance.  Also, I recommend a self-defense item (like pepper spray), just in case.  If after a few meets everything seems to be fine, and some in person trust is gained, then just go with it and enjoy."
rel_19508749,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,187,"All right, honey, you need to get clear of that boy ASAP. 

I understand what you’re saying about coping mechanisms, I’ve been in that position. If it’s at all helpful some things that have helped me are gaming, practicing with makeup, colouring, looking at recipes or a video from a youtuber I like. 

Gaslighting is basically a form of mental/emotional abuse whereby the abuser will treat you poorly in some way and when you approach or confront them about it and hold them accountable, they flip it back on you. They make it out to be *your* fault rather than theirs. They might outright deny what they’ve done, try bf justify it by blaming you, or say something like you’re overreacting. Or that you’re crazy. 

Sharing how you feel with loved ones doesn’t make you a burden. And no matter how much you’re struggling with mental health there is no reason for someone to treat you poorly. What he’s doing is not okay at all. 

I hope I can help somehow. If you’d like to ever chat privately you can message me. And I mean that 100%"
rel_12365176,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,269,"Hey, another COVID bride here. We postponed our April wedding to August, but got legally married last weekend. It hurt not having parents there and hurt not having the wedding we have been planning. But we both agreed it was important to do and we didn't want to wait. There were some hurt feelings for sure, but once we explained our reasoning everything was accepted. I think you should try that. 

We felt it was important to get married now for a couple reasons:

1. We had already obtained our marriage license and didnt want to pay the application fee again.

2. While neither of us work in healthcare, we are both essential workers and exposed to other people/the public on a daily basis. Outside of wearing masks and washing hands, we cannot protect ourselves like others can. Social distancing isn't an option for either of us at our jobs. 

3. We believe we have both already been exposed, although the person does not meet testing requirements due to their age and living situation.

If one of us were to get sick, the other wouldnt have any legal standing to get information from the hospital. We also own a house and other assets together. Because of everything going on, we thought it was important to have the legal benefits of marriage. We will not wear our wedding rings until August, I didn't wear my dress, we didn't light our unity candle, etc. For witnesses, we just used the maid of honor and best man. We basically just said our vows (legally required in my state) and signed the papers."
rel_31868106,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,233,"There’s so much wrong in the post that kinda makes it hard to take you seriously. My initial thought was to be a troll. Though I decided maybe there’s a chance you actually like this girl. 

So the weight gain first. You are both adolescents and your bodies are still developing. Not to mention she was taking birth control which will mess with a woman’s hormones and as result weight. Fifty pounds is a lot of weight so there’s missing info. Has she turned lazy? Has her diet changed? Is she exaggerating? 

Encouraging your partner to be healthy and make healthy decisions is always a good idea. If you’re enabling her eating Taco Bell and then bitching cuz she’s getting chubby, you’re a dick. If she’s eating pizza and playing video games while you’re making salads with raspberry vinaigrette and are a four sport letterman…well, the chances are you guys are not compatible.

If she has actually gained 50 pounds that fast and there is no explanation other than she’s off birth control, she needs to see her doctor. Again, encourage healthy decisions. 

Just remember, you are both growing, you should be gaining weight, things will even out if she’s a healthy person. 

Beyond that, dude, cut yourself some slack. You are 17, life is not that serious. You have plenty of time to see what happens. It’s only been a couple months."
rel_7815675,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,240,"First of all thanks! Secondly, I would probably just confess my feelings to the girl I liked and just get it out of the way. Closure is always beneficial in situations like these because it leads to better conclusions. What I mean by that is if you get closure from the girl you like in your situation you have 2  god options. 1. She doesn't reciprocate the feelings you have for her so you move on. It seems easy enough on paper but in reality it can be harder than you think, it was for me at least. I just spent more time with my friends, went outside/worked out more, and became more social in general which is how I met my current girlfriend. 2. If she does have feelings for you too I would say go for the whole relationship thing. As well if you're worried about ruining the friendship between the girl that may have feelings for you, you can always ask her if she has/had any love interest in you and just let her know that you'd be hopping into a relationship with her friend but just straight up tell her that you don't want it to ruin you're friendship between each other, i'm sure she'll likely understand.

You're situation might be somewhat different from mine but I hope something in here may or may not have been helpful. (Also sorry it's kind of long haha)."
rel_33877913,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,269,"Like I've said in other comments, for me having a sleepless night or two isn't just a mild inconvenience. I'm not just being selfish about wanting an uninterrupted night of sleep because I don't want to be uncomfortable. As I get older, it takes less and less missed sleep for me to turn into a complete wreck of a person. I get angry, paranoid, combative, impulsive, make bad decisions, etc and it snowballs into continuing to get less sleep because I've knocked myself out of balance. After two or three days of no sleep I can start to get auditory hallucinations and really go off the deep end. It's essential to my daily functioning that I get a good night's sleep every night. Of course things come up now and then that make that difficult, but if I actively choose to go without sleep, I'm choosing this outcome. Which isn't good for me, or for Kate. Kate is not going to like the person I become without sleep. She hasn't met him yet because I'm so careful.

I'm realizing from these responses though that no one is really going to understand this if they don't suffer the same way. Including Kate. No matter how much I explain, people will still see it as a selfish choice I make because I don't want to be inconvenienced, not a necessary decision for my own health. I don't know how else to explain, and yet still no one gets it. So I guess that's that. I need to figure out how to deal with being alone for the rest of my life."

rel_18754748,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,266,"&gt;Even the excuse you offer at the end, that you're not excusing cheating and would leave, is a weak and limp wristed attempt not to own your own opinion stated prior.

I never really stated an opinion about cheating, on the contrary I have extremely strong feelings when it comes to cheating and I would never condone it. What I am saying is there is no way of knowing that just because this person cheated that automatically means that they didn't love their partner and were using them for a free home and support as comments were claiming. Like the comment I was responding to stated, someone who was truly using the OP would have continued the lie in order to get what she wanted. Yes she did a truly horrible thing and hurt someone deeply and yes he should absolutely not give her a second chance. I was just stating that this sub acts like every post is a movie where there's the good guy and the villain. The world frankly just isn't so black and white.

I'll also add that I have never been cheated on (that I know of) and have never cheated, so I have no horse in this race. I understand that you may be biased given the fact that it appears you have been cheated on. Which I will ad, I am genuinely sorry you've gone through that, I can't imagine how horrible it must be and I completely understand why you might feel the way you do and I mean no offence. I'm just trying to be objective here."
rel_8689760,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,296,"I just have to say that she wasn't asking to be groped. It is pretty nasty and concerning that someone she may be working for in the future has done this to her. Her comments may be an attempt to normalize it for herself in which case a discussion may be very necessary. It is imperative though that you dont blame her. Just tell her how concerned you are for her safety, and that you aren't mad about her response but worried. 

I think by telling herself it's okay, she'll get the job she so desperately wants, she's justifying how she  responded to it. Confrontation isn't easy, especially not when you've been sexually harassed/ assaulted in front of all of your work peers. It's hard to understand, but you start feeling guilty about being groped, about not responding, wandering if you should have made a scene or if that would have made it worse or more embarrassing. She might feel guilty it happened, like she did wrong by you, so she's essentially rewriting the narrative. She let that perv touch her, she'll get a promotion and the money from the company, she's the one in control/power. That line of thinking is a lot nicer than I've been continuously assaulted by a higher up and feel powerless. 

Ask her if that's how she really feels. Tell her it's okay to be upset, grossed out by it. Tell her you're concerned about what might happen in the future if she were to work with this person, and then ask her what she truly wants. Tell her she's amazing, that she can find a job anywhere, and most importantly that her boss shouldn't have put his hands on her, that you dont blame her, that it isn't her fault."

That's all I needed to know. And all you should need to know. There is absolutely zero reason to lie even once in my book. But sometimes, there may be an extreme scenario (such as a suicide attempt) that someone may originally lie about but then give the truth the second time around. You didn't even get the truth the second time around, and this wasn't some deep personal issue this was her hanging out at some guy's house and drinking. And I'm sorry, a whore friend? Is this just baseless name-calling or is this legitimate like ""this girl is an actual slut and knowingly sleeps with married men and feeds off high drama"" kind of thing?

I don't believe that you ""don't know what you should do."" I think you have a strong feeling of what you, personally, would really like to do. But you just can't get yourself to do it."

rel_7447192,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,114,"Shut the *fuck* up. 

The new partner’s feelings could not be less relevant. She can go fuck her self, maybe even literally. The turbulent environment created by the father here is so fucking inconsiderate that if I was OP, I too would have tried to dissuade my kids from a conversation about transitional surgery to spare me the headache.

Just because his new partner is transphobic doesn’t mean she’s incapable of understanding that sometimes, you’re not the star of the show.

Anyone in this thread who is valuing the hurt feelings of the new partner, transgender or not, over the well being of those kids is a reactionary moron. Get the fuck over yourself."

I’m a girl, not a guy and can say, for the most part, when I was a teen, us girls used to do this. Just cause that’s what happens. But it wasn’t sexual, done with consent and stopped before I was an adult. As an adult, I see this as weird. Possibly she’s bi or lesbian and either unaware or still on her journey of being ok to come out. Thats another angle. She could have experienced SA as a kid and has weird sexual behaviours/ difficulties seeing healthy boundaries as an adult. She could be an unhealthy partner and just doesn’t care."
rel_27397809,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,206,"I have a boyfriend who follows his attractive ex. And she takes those boudoir pictures and plasters them all over social media. Pisses me off to no end. I see red everytime I even think about it. (Not healthy, I know).

However, 

Sometimes I have to have ""those talks"" with myself in the morning on accepting the things I can't change or control. I'll wake up with anxiety about it, think about it all day long, and make myself sick. You don't want to feel that way everyday, you'll drive yourself crazy. 

So what I do is I try to be the best version of myself. Someone who isn't ""me"" but the ""me"" I wish to be. Less controlling and viscious. Because at the end of the day I don't want to tell my boyfriend to block or delete her, I want to come to an agreement with myself that my insecurity is the problem, not this chicks perfect ass all over my Facebook. 

Thus, I try to talk myself through the mindset that I'm a badass bitch, who swoons my man over everyday, who isn't phased by shit, and who doesn't put a leash on anyone. You give a dog a leash, they run away."
rel_7235502,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,223,"So she completely disregards your history, disregards your own agency about whether you do a thing or not, accuses you of being a bigot, and is stonewalling you? **This isn't your problem to fix.** She's the one being unreasonable. If nothing else she should be willing to simply talk about it, try to persuade you, find a way you'd be comfortable, etc. Instead she's just giving you the silent treatment and trying to bully you into doing what she demands. While this is the only argument you've had to date, I've got to wonder how often you've told her ""no"" before - might be you've just always gone along with her demands, and now you've got opinions of your own she doesn't like it.

Regardless, all you can do is ask her why she's so dismissive of your history, given that's the reason you don't really want to go. ""I'm not comfortable going because of my history of sexual assault and bullying"", it's that simple. She'll either give a shit or she won't. If she doesn't care, and is happy to completely trample your own discomfort just because she wants her own way, that really doesn't bode well for the future of your relationship. Stick to your guns, don't cave and do something you're fundamentally uncomfortable with just because she's throwing a tantrum."
rel_5685396,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,333,"Firstly, you are not fat at all. Don't let anyone plant those kinds of ideas in your head. Howrever, you are at the higher end of normal BMI, and depending on how you distribute weight; i.e apple shaped versus pear shaped, it may lead to certain perceptions of body size.

I am saying this because I noticed in some cultures, they lack social tact. This is true in many Asian, Southern European and African cultures. They literally say whatever they think of your body or image as soon as they see you; be it good or bad. In some of those cultures, even a little bit of body weight makes them associate women with being heavy set.  I am from one of these cultures, and I have grown up with women/men feeling free to tell you that you gained weight, or you look very fat. My cousin went to my uncle's funeral and one of the men there asked her why she got so fat. It wasn't even meant as an insult in his eyes, but rather as an observation.

I am assuming you live in a Western culture where it is unacceptable to speak freely about someone else's body. If there is this culture mismatch, your boyfriend may have no idea that it is inappropriate, and may be accustomed to hearing people speak their minds about women's bodies. You should let him know it makes you extremely uncomfortable if this is the case and explain how the social norms work here. That it is insulting and makes you incredibly uncomfortable.

If this isn't the case that he is from any of those cultures then you TRULY need to tell him that when he stands idly by, it makes you feel as if he is corroborating that you are overweight. That if he doesn't feel this way then he needs to defend you when his mother makes these body shaming comments. This is a bigger problem in my eyes than the aforementioned situation."
rel_25142429,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,475,"Dear Madame,

Porn is a controvertial topic betwen couples nowadays since it's a very normal activity for males specially. I really feel you since some time ago  I was really insecure about my gf paying atention to other guys so I will try to give you some of the tips and thoughts that helped me become a better partner.

The main problem here is the definition of cheating in my opinion and that is a filosofic problem that you have to think through in order to move on.

It is very normal to expect that when you meet someone you really like they fit perfectly in your own standards since you are in love; but when you realise that they are not perfect you get upset about it and it's normal. 

Your own standards tend to play against you, and it  might corrode what it seems to be a good relationship(in some ways weather or not it is),that's why you have to be open-minded and try to look up for what is in your best interest in a relationship.

I don't support lying in any aspect and even less about things that are important to your partner. That why it;d be good idea to have a **Good Conversation** about that and tell him what you are feeling, communication is esential and he might not know that he is hurting you by his irresponsible actions( like going out with other girls and telling you that he doesn't watch porn but he does)

On the other hand, I'd recommend not to be obssesed with the word cheating since it really gets **into your mind**. Furthermore, to feel insecure about him cheating every time that he goes out will really bring down your mood and slowly deteriorate the relationship.

I recommend you try to be busy doing thinks you like and try to focus on yourself, being too aware never helps.

If you feel to insecure about yourself, it will be hard to have relationships since I've already told you, there is bound to be contact with another people. The best you can do is find a loyal and ethic person.

To sum up, as to what I understood about your relationship; your boyfriend doesn't seem to give the same importance as you to some things leading to you feeling more insecure, so you should have a serious talk in order to prevent that from further happening and also trying to fix your insecurities (Going to the gym, studying, doing something you like, etc) we all have value to our person and it's our partner that has to recognize that, if he doesn't you should move on.

This is my personal advise based on my opinion and experience, hope it helps you to think about it more thoroughly to have a more healthy lifestyle and relationship

Cheer up!"
rel_4222193,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,428,"You actually made me realise that he exhibits more signs than I originally thought, especially the one about being alone. I realised that looking back at his history, he has very rarely actually been alone. Even if he wasn't committing to people he still had someone around that he would always talk to or fill the empty space. Before our relationship he had a 6 year relationship even though we're only 20 and he was very unable to let go of that relationship even though he didn't love her and seemed to just do anything he wanted behind her back. And we got into a relationship not long after that one has ended. 

The parent/child relationship thing just hits home so hard. Right now we're supposedly on a break, I tried contacting him that I can't handle this ""I'll take a break, do whatever I want and then come back and expect you to be fine with it"" thing and that maybe we should just end it. He got angry and told me that he wasn't just doing whatever he wanted and that he was studying and trying to get his shit back together and quickly categorised what I was doing as fighting when he was the one getting angry when I remained calm and tried to explain myself to him. He's refusing to end it right now in a way and doesn't want me to contact him again until he supposedly tried to fix things his own way. Should I just wait for him to come and talk and then try to decide what to do? and while waiting should I be waiting with a mentality of trying my best to walk away even if he wants me to stay or giving him a chance if he does get his shit back together? there is still no guarantee that this situation won't repeat itself. If I do take him back at any point, which is something that I now truly believe is unhealthy, I'm not doing so without him committing to therapy at least to find ways to deal with his illness. I don't want to be hurting him either or forcing a life that he doesn't truly want where there's no way for him to not get hurt onto him. And of course I don't want to just be waiting for this to take me further down the rabbit hole.

They've only been dating since September, though, and there's still a (small) risk that OP could have an unknown prior HIV infection.... and you never know if your partner is sleeping around outside of the relationship, and could contract HIV and pass it on to you.

No one on here will be able to tell you one way or another what he is up to.  You will have to find out.  I am simply saying... there is more to this story and he is hiding something.  Maybe he is cheating or at least is thinking about it.  Maybe he wants out of the relationship and wants to see what else is out there before doing do so.  Or, he enjoys catfishing and fucking with people.  Either way, its kind of weird.

One thing that I'd urge a little bit of caution with (and again, just personal experience!); a little bit of 'good pressure' can feel like a mountain of 'bad pressure' to a girl who's already aware of the fact she needs to lose weight.

I'm not at my ideal weight right now after a ligament injury, and am working hard to lose it at the moment. I play roller derby three times a week and am training for a half marathon. I *know* how to lose weight,  and am doing absolutely fine, but my guy still feels the need to arch an eyebrow (even if its clearly meant in a lighthearted way) if I eat some mango (""that's a treat food, so much sugar!""), have a pint at the weekend, or ask how my running's going when I'm slobbing out watching TV. Does my head in, but I've learnt to just roll my eyes, laugh it off and suck it up!

rel_444507,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,274,"You cannot be serious. Did you do anything wrong? You flat out called your girlfriend incoherent and hysterical in an email conversation.

You approached it correctly, but then let her poke and prod you into acting like a complete idiot. She felt attacked by you saying she doesn't communicate and hides from sex. You're telling her there's something wrong with the relationship, so it's not exactly a surprised she would feel insulted and put-upon. So she attacked right back at you. First on communication, which you brushed off, and then on paying attention to other people while you're out with her. You reacted like a moron, so she gets the high-ground back. 

The question is, what's next. Rather than continuing to attack her on the sex issue and get the high-ground back via force, have a conversation about her belief that you're paying attention to other people and not her. Maybe there *is* something you can change in that regard. If you accept that she might have a valid point on that subject, it's going to make it easier for her to accept that you might have a valid point on the subject of sex and intimacy.

The good thing about LDRs is when they finish there's a natural distance. Get back to NY, start to process and grieve. Watch out for that bargaining (from her or you ) it's ALWAYS a bad idea.

Get your friends or family around and start spending some of that money for presents and hampers on yourself. Take a vaction with your best friend with no intention of meeting women, have a weekend playing video games with friends, go to a sporting event, whatever you fancy just make sure to break your established routine for a few days each week until you start to feel like yourself (singular) again.

There’s prob a lot more things in her life than mine that she struggles with, having a disability. I think being direct is going to be the best way she will handle anything though, with uncertainty comes lack of clarity and she will likely need that to feel comfortable or to at least establish trust. 

Don’t be afraid to ask her what she needs, what she is and isn’t comfortable with from you, and do your best to be supportive of whatever that is no matter what you think would be better. You’re likely going to be in the best position possible for her to find and gain trust. Your parents May be loving but it may still be hard for her to fully trust them for some time.

rel_19240981,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,234,"as someone in a relationship who has her bf replying to her texts 24/7, i understand your side. but i also understand his. there are times when i text him and he replies immediately and i do the same for him. when neither of us do, its usually because we’re both busy, doing our own thing or we just need a minute to reply bc we have something else on our mind. my bf has lots of friends and so do i. he knows my priority lies with family, him and then friends. its the same for him. you have to understand that significant others need time away from their partner or sometimes dont reply immediately because they might have something on their mind for themselves. not everything revolves around your significant other. certain things do and others dont. what you need to do first before going into ANY relationship is establishing some boundaries and being independent. being codependent like you are now, is very toxic and rough. and will cause problems between the two of you in the future.

do everyone a favor and leave him. then, focus on yourself and finding good things for yourself to make yourself happy. when you’ve reached a stable place where you feel good about yourself, then slowly ease back into dating. trust me. you should be your number one priority before going and dating someone else."

I sat him down and talked with him and he told me that he thinks the level of stress he's at now is circumstantial (dependent on the job) and that it would lessen after he gets a job, he told me I get too freaked out around his moods and he asked me to ""not attach yourself to other people's problems so much"" because he doesn't feel like he can confide in me when I'm stressed out from his behavior (which didn't feel altogether fair to me), and that he'd work on it.

rel_22933046,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,271,"Well, right off the bat you need to solve that projection you have so it doesn't get in the way of you communicating your concerns to your mother objectively and clearly.   


The age gap is a HUGE factor. In fact, my sister in law was recently telling us how her MIL was forcing my SILs 12 and 10 year old daughter to play with a 7 year old, that gap is just too big of a difference in terms of what can they do and is a LEGIT reason why kids may not be interested in playing with younger kids.   


Second, you are absolutely right your daughter gets to play with whoever she wants. However, I would instead turn it around and ask your mother to ask Saras parents if they are okay with Sara playing with your daughter as well as with Tom &amp; Fred.. and see what they have to say.. maybe that way the age gap will become more obvious to your mother.   


Third, ask your mom to put herself in any kids shoes, not to put any  kids in her own shoes. Would she enjoy doing something she really doesn't want to?   


Fourth, teach your daughter about consent and the ability to say no. Nobody should ever be forced to be with someone they don't want to be with, even if it's a play date. Kids should also be listened to and maybe then adults would understand kids can make logical choices as well.

rel_12606168,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,241,"Lockdown has probably given her the distance she needed to re-evaluate, well, everything, for the first time since you got together. It was an opportunity to stop thinking about the “moment” and start focusing in the future. 

You helped her get past a very difficult period of her life — the deterioration of her marriage and the death of her husband (which, even if they were separated, was still a blow, I would think). Her connection to and affection for you may have been substantially wrapped up in that. But it’s been a while now. Her needs now are different from her needs then. 

She’s looking at you as someone who is at a different stage of life from her. As much as she likes you and cares for you, she may have concluded that you’re not what she “wants” going forward. She’s framing it as “you deserve to go find the right person for you,” but really she’s probably just breaking up with you. 

She’s not “old,” but when we hit 50, a lot of us start looking for our “last” partner. If you think you can’t trust someone to stick around, you’re more willing to cut bait and keep looking. The idea of spending, say, 5 years on a relationship to “see where things go” just isn’t as attractive at 50 as it is at 29. So your earlier unwillingness to commit might be working against you here, too."
rel_26260494,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,225,"That's the thing though, it's only true in your opinion. It's clearly not true to your partner, otherwise they wouldn't be there. Just because you don't do it with the intent of making someone feel guilty or to shut down a conversation, doesn't mean that it doesn't cause the same outcome. You need to work on your self esteem and stop making it your partner's job to do it for you, again, whether intentional or not. If your partner started saying it, wouldn't you feel upset? Maybe worried they'd leave you? Make you feel like you have a problem to solve and make them feel better? Now imagine that regularly. It's exhausting. Someone I was seeing for a few months pulled it out all the time, and I couldn't even ask him how he was at one point without then having to console him and tell him how great he was. We couldn't have a normal conversation if he'd had a bad day or bad week and I felt like his therapist. You can think what you want about yourself, but it's on you to change things you don't like about yourself and not your partner's job to tell you you're perfect just the way you are and to be ready to give you such reassurance whenever you two speak. The first step is therapy."
rel_2079918,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,257,"First of all, I'm sorry for everyone involved in this situation. This sounds extremely trying for everyone. 
Unfortunately, I fear there's only so much you personally can do to help your husband. Right now he's in probably one of most difficult situations in his life. You've indicated that he and his father have a strained relationship at best in recent years, and that is probably a result of a lifetime of friction between them. Now his father is going to die with a lot of unresolved feelings between the two of them. I imagine that's at the heart of his suffering. We don't want to go to bed angry, and we don't want to lose a parent with resolving our issues. I think it may be useful to reach out to any family on his side and see if this may be the case. If there are issues, it may help him to reach out to his dad and try to settle their problems. You can only help so much here because while you're his new family, you're not his old family. You don't know histories and dynamics well enough to wade into it with him. But you can encourage those who understand the situation to reach out to your husband and help, and you can support him through this still. 
This may be your best course of action because his father is going to pass soon, and his grief may be enormously more difficult if there's unresolved issues between the two of them.
Best of luck."
rel_36098926,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,259,"So frankly, a movement is the people who make it up, yeah? Are there absolute misandrists who are very loud online? Yes. However,  I have met FAR more rational intersectional feminists than I have extremists in real life. If the majority were extreme, you could say your point has validity. The vast majority of people who consider to themselves feminist are not extreme and I've hung out in these circles since about 2002, and you can't just exclude the rational ones just because the misandrists speak louder. Now it is a legitimate criticism that the quieter feminists should be criticizing the man-haters? Absolutely, because they should be. I even try to give some mra groups the time of day, too, because I know there are legitimately some rational people in that group who do just want to promote equality, too. You can dislike the misandrists all you want (and as you should), but call them what they are - misandrists. There's a reason there's a specific word for it. There are still a majority of people who are for equality under the feminism banner and I'm not about to see those people get trashed since what they actually are looking for equality, which is rational. And you know what, I believe the same thing about MRAs who are for equality, too. My trouble is that I have actually met MRAs irl who do believe I'm lesser for being a woman, so it's harder to find the true equalists in that movement for me, but I know they're there too."

I think in a lot of ways this is the real issue. You are stuck in a relationship with a sack of sawdust because you fear the isolation that will occur if you break ties. You need to find friends, independent of him, that you can rely on so you have a social support system that is your own. Let's be real: he is probably conscious you are stuck and that is part of how he manipulates you.

Don't get caught up on semantics. Who cares if it is technically cheating. Even sidestepping that what he does is selfish and cruel and completely indulgent. Why should you keep burning yourself alive hoping he magically changes when let's be real: he has no reason to change, he can be shit to you and you just accept it. If anything he will only get worse. 

You aren't happy. I would start reaching out socially, attending events [covid allowing], slowly building up a life independent of him. This is something that you need to have in every relationship, independence within a relationship is still important and all the more so when you date someone toxic."

Had one night stand. I thought it went well and texted her the next day with something light and saying is love to take her out. Tries again the next week. No response. And now over two weeks later she says ""I don't know if you understand but I'm really not okay with how things went down."" 

How we met:

We met at a music venue on a sat night. We hit it off and got physical, exchanged numbers, and promised to go on a date. Went to the same music venue next night and met her there by accident. We hit it off again. She had ridden her bike instead of driving that night, so I offered to take her home at the end. She was fine with that. Her friends were there and saw all this transpire. We get there and start making out. We then transition to her place. We make out and start taking her clothes off. She says she doesn't want to have sex. She kind of wanted to go on the date. I said that's fine. She verbally invites me to her room. We go there where she blows me. I offer to go down on her. She refuses. I say that's fine. I suggest we watch a movie. Were chilling for a bit but thing start getting heated again. She says she wants to do it and we proceed to have sex. I'm chilling afterwards there for awhile and everything seems really positive. She says I can stay the night. I decline as I have to do something kind of early and leave her place e at 4 am. Tried reaching out for another date day after and another time one week later. And just got the above response. How should I proceed?

Edit: I called one night stand but look like I misunderstood its definition. I thought we would see each other again"

Did you fuck up?  You bet your ass you did.  From what you told us, he didn't do anything to deserve what you did to him.  This is beyond simply protecting yourself because he 'felt trapped', you intended to hurt him emotionally and financially.  I'm glad that you feel remorse over your actions because that means that inside you know how wrong you were.

The next thing to consider is, what can you do to make things right.  
What can you do to repair the damage he's suffered?  Give him back his share of the security deposit; he's going to need the money.  Give him back a prorated amount of the lease this month.  Go to the landlord and take over the lease immediately.  Get copies of the paperwork he can keep for his records.  Don't let him suffer unnecessarily because of what you did.  
What can you do to redeem yourself?  Fucking apologize, for throwing him out, for ignoring him, for endangering his belongings, for the police, for your parents.  Tell him he didn't deserve what you did to him and that you'll help him get established in a new place anyway you can.

If you ever cared about him, you'll do these things.

Just some additional things to consider:  Find a new therapist.  One that won't suggest you break the law.  Know that he has grounds to sue you in small claims court for all the expenses incurred as a result of your actions.  Take care of him and hope that he doesn't decide to come after you for moving costs, hotel rooms, or anything else he can convince the judge he's entitled to."

Especially if by ""crazy"" you mean speaking outside of our inside voices, being sassy (AKA insulting) and being extraordinarily sensitive when it comes to anything that could possibly be mistaken for any form of denial in the bedroom. 

It's not cool to be called vulgar things by your SO and I am by no means advocating or defending that, but at the same time you need to understand that A.) she was just feeling horny (booze tends to have that effect) and B.) She just wanted to ride your dick into the moonlight until her cows came home (&amp; probably yours too) - C.) you interrupted her glorious homecumming with your astute consideration (such a douche) and D.) she in turn interpreted that (in her soused state) as you not wanting anything to do with her. 

If your going to spend your days turning every drunken misinterpretation and over exaggeration into an opportunity to practice your mental illness diagnostics, I at least recommend purchasing the DSM-5. 

Also for the love of all things fine and mighty on this earth, PLEASE do not suggest to her that she may be suffering from a bipolar disorder - you ain't never gonna get ur dick rid after that.

I don't know and I don't care, and folk are advising on masturbating in relation to enabling the health of their sex life. Their age isn't really relevant to the issues they're facing, and trying to take a high and mighty road they shouldn't have sex doesn't address their issue.

Cause, and stay with me on this, human beings of a very diverse range of ages can have a sex life. Telling them not to might as well be like telling the wind to stop.

So try to stick to the actual topic OP is bringing up. And I understand where you are coming from to a degree, but you should try not projecting what you think is right into advice concerning sex for others.

And there's also an element of what looks like trying to shame folk for masturbating. Maybe you're extremely sex positive, maybe not, maybe I am, maybe I'm not- but those preferences don't really have to do with OP."

She has schizophrenia which means she could very well be imagining all of it. How would you like it if your partner jumped out of bed and started accusing you of drugging them and masturbating over them while they slept??  To her, it would be very real. But it might not actually be happening. And it’s really hard to know because of the mental illness. I’m not gonna jump on the bandwagon that he’s gaslighting her and doing all these terrible things, when she has a mental illness that might make it seem like he’s doing these things. I’m also not gonna say that he’s going to sabotage all of her relationships with Doctors and her appointments and everything else and that he’s gaslighting her because we don’t know that she is being gaslighted. It might all be in her head and in that case, he’s a boyfriend that’s being accused of awful things and he’s just trying to get her help.

I guess I’m giving him the benefit of the doubt, because of the illness. I really hope for her sake that he’s not actually doing these things and that she can come back from this and that they can have an OK relationship again."
rel_8862187,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,317,"We had been dating for two years, had applied to grad school programs in the same cities, lived together for about a year, and saw each other at potential life partners. We also both knew that we were in our early 20's and dealing with the chaos and unpredictability of young adulthood. 

It is hard to remember, because it was 13 years ago, but I believe I was the romantic wanting to be with her forever and having a lot of expectations for the relationship. My wife was much more practical, level headed, and wanted to see where it went. She's a statistician/scientist and it's reflected in her personality. But, by the time we were engaged, I had spent time with my nephew and discovered I liked and wanted kids. I am sure my wife wouldn't have agreed to marry me if that hadn't happened.

OP's comments about conflicting religions while in a relationship in his early 20's, and his girlfriend's position, sounded very similar to my experience. I wanted to comment that people change in their 20's. Many people grow and become more accommodating and willing to compromise. People also learn what they really want, outside of their upbringing, be it religion or wanting children.

Seeing as OP and his Girlfriend are both non-religious, but come from religious traditions, I could see both their expectations for how to raise children changing as they reach their 30's. I could see OP's girlfriend being more willing to compromise with her partner about the children's religion. I could see OP standing up to his parent's threats about how OP's children must be raised. OP could marry someone with his parents religion, avoid that conflict, but grow more assertive in his non-religious stance and be isolated from his wife and kids. My point is they are young, they are going to change, so I'm kinda sympathetic to OP's girlfriend's position."
rel_34765566,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,108,"That sucks and honestly I'm not sure if I really have any advice for you. It's not fair for him to want alone time but not be understanding of you also wanting it.  Maybe it's because your alone time is on a trip instead of at home? Did you tell him about the trip before planning it?

And maybe you spending time in the office would help but it's not a gauruntee. I know some people really like alone time at the end of the night so idk if he would be picky about it at all. But he should be willing to make compromises if you are."

rel_38061185,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,188,"Love is choosing to be with your partner and working to be in a good relationship with them. Words can affect us in many ways. Take time to actually think about how you feel about your girlfriend. Think about the kind of person you want to marry, what you expectations and wants are. What do you want for your future? Do you want children? If so about how many? How would you raise them? Would you be strict or gentle parent? Spank or speak to them? What do you want sexually, emotionally, spiritually, mentally and physically in a relationship. Once you know what you want for you and your future then you can talk to your girlfriend. Ask her the same things. See if they align and if there can be a compromise. If you are too incompatible then I wouldn't recommend thinking about marriage or at least just yet. If y'all are compatible then reflect on wether you would want to do all that and spend the rest of your life with her. If so then y'all can start to discuss it and one day get married."

And sorry but 13$ is a lot for a drink especially when shes saying she has debt but thats just coming from someone who manages their money well and has no debt. Also She could have talked to him like an adult just as much as you are calling him a man baby that cant talk to her? you only know one very biased side to the story, as again… neither of us were there or are in their relationship. 

you really seem like the single type that obsesses over other peoples relationships and wants to give advice you don’t know much about! Enjoy doing that i guess! And have a nice day though! I was trying to give real advice unlike your “go talk to him something is wrong”"
rel_97484,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,383,"That's the thing. I'm constantly telling her and showing her how much I really love her new shape. Whenever she mentions she's fat or gross or what have you, and I protest and tell her otherwise, she'll roll her eyes and give me this look as if saying, yeah right. It's like she doesn't believe me or doesn't want to believe me. I don't know. I don't know how she's rationalizing this, even after I have sat her down before and told her I find her incredibly beautiful now. I don't want her to think I'm just saying these things as my duty as a good boyfriend, or to make her feel better, or even to hint that I want her to lose the weight, which I'm worried is what she may be thinking.

But there have been positives in this. Sometimes when I'll comment on something about her body, she'll agree that that particular shirt *does* look very good on her or whatever. But I'm also concerned, in this respect, that she'll think I didn't like her body before since I'm responding so positively to this new body. 

I've been thinking about this for a few weeks. I don't know what I'm doing waiting so long to talk to her directly about this, but these are the concerns I have. If I talk to her about it, will she think I'm implying any of these other things? Not that I think she'll jump to those conclusions because she's not an irrational or overly emotional person, but this is all very new for the both of us, and I don't want to fuck anything up.

I'm really sorry you had a difficult experience going though the same situation. People really suck, especially family; my girlfriend's mom is the absolute worst and she's been very vocal about the weight gain. And I'm happy for you and your boyfriend that you've found a way to move past this--for you, it was accepting this new body. I don't know what that will be for my girlfriend, I just really want her to be happy in the end. Granted, I do have a bias and I'm rooting for a particular outcome, but I wouldn't love her any less and I'd definitely support her is she chose otherwise."

Coming from having my daughter's who have completely different opinions on fashion....wedding dress shopping went exactly as I knew it would. One daughter is more reserved than the other so although they look the same at first glance...they looked completely different on their wedding days! It's your day and its all about you so please try not to think too much about what your Mom thinks od your body type. All that matters is that you are comfortable in your own skin. And my last point...both of my daughter's are 5'8 and one works out but the other doesn't, she is a runner and the one who works out weighed 168 on her wedding day but doesn't have an ounce of fat on her, she is more shapely than her sister who weighs 20lbs less and they look identical in size.

rel_27843024,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,258,You’re right to feel insulted and frustrated. It sounds like you have adapted your life around her for a quiet life to make her happy. The fact that she doesn’t like your friend’s wives should not stop you from seeing your actual friends. It shows real insecurity and jealousy on her part. Sounds like she is worried you’ll bump into these wives and speak to them but also that she’s jealous of you spending time with your friends. She’s accusing you but has no evidence. She’s also being really picky and showing that she’s keeping a close eye on you describing which way you drive down the street. It’s all way too intense and not normal. I also did wonder if she’s projecting and if you need to consider if someone has such a suspicious mind is that because they judge you by their own standards? Unfortunately it is classic behaviour of someone who has something to hide - to accuse the other person. This alleviates their feelings of guilt but also due to paranoia about their behaviour they wonder if you’re doing the same. The trust is clearly not there and you deserve not to be questioned and grilled. It’s disrespectful and is emotional / mental abuse. You could be locked in a cupboard and she would accuse you of talking to someone. I wonder how she would feel if you started asking her about her whereabouts?…maybe try it and see how she reacts. I bet she’ll panic and try to put the diversion back on you.
rel_1417184,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,149,"The two aren't mutually exclusive as I see it. There's nothing wrong with wanting to connect with someone.

I love to spend time with my wife, but I also have a long list of things that interest me outside of the relationship that has nothing to do with her. If didn't have anything else that made me happy, that would be concerning. 

I think the point of the advice in question is to avoid co-dependence. You can and should spend time with someone who you want to spend time with and feels the same, but you should also have a life outside of that so you don't start defining yourself in terms of the relationship. Having your everything tied up in connecting with others is not the underpinnings of a healthy relationship. "

From my understanding of American family Court out side of the ultra religious states most judges don't care about who pays the child support as long as its not the state.

Even if a guy can prove he's never slept with a woman claiming he's the dad never mind show DNA he's not the kid some judges still shackle the innocent guy to suffer and pay for some crazy woman's mistake.

Here you have what sounds like a successful enough mother in her career with a respectable partner with no question of drug use the OP would be lucky if they don't use the  messages from the OP and his mother admitting he knows he's the biological child but ignoring legal responsibility to bring charges against him for abandonment and leading to a termination of any parental rights a positive DNA test may normally bring."

It doesn’t sound like it’s a big thing to him at all, more like an ego being hurt. You’ve done the right thing in my opinion, age is just a number but 24 and 30 are still very different stages of life. Ask yourself, if you could put all emotions aside and ONLY consider your own, not his, don’t worry about how he feels, don’t worry about what ifs, just you for yourself.

rel_4120792,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,436,"Depression (additional depression I should say) around the forced attendance at community college vs. where she actually is qualified to be seems like a very likely explanation for this sudden shift in mood. That must be so painful and disheartening, especially as friends or acquaintances that went off to 4 year institutions are probably loving it so much right now and posting all kinds of exciting things on social media. Despite Reddit's love for community college being a financially responsible alternative to starting at a real university right off the bat, it's really a night and day experience, and CC must feel like the 13th grade to her right now, except 13th grade with none of her friends there by her side, and not what she'd been looking forward to for so long. I bet she'd thought that attending a university would be transformation to her life and maybe leaving all of her hardships in the past and truly beginning life as an adult, which would lead her into stages of empowerment to never be anyone's victim ever again etc, and to be her own independent person.

Yet sorry man, no matter how much she loves you, if she does, being dependent on living with a boyfriend at only 18 yrs old could also be an ugly reminder of how desperately shackled she is and can't break free to turn her life into what she wants it to be, or to explore enough independence to really decide what she wants. You might be super nice to her, but in many ways, she could consciously or subconsciously be feeling like you're just the next keeper of her freedom. If she had money and had a better overall supportive family experience before this point, she straight up would not be living with you. She'd be off at school, making friends from all over the country, going to football games, expanding her horizons academically/professionally/socially at and explosive rate, at every turn.

If you want to be supportive, maybe see if you can help her begin to organize how she can get herself back on the track she wants to be on in life, no matter what the consequences are to your relationship with her. Like, are there ways she can apply for loans and ask the university to help her attend in the spring or next fall. 

I'm making a lot of assumptions here of course, so forgive me, but she just must feel so unlucky in life, and the greatest 18yr old boyfriend is just an 18yr old boyfriend. It's a band-aid in the grand scheme of things. "

This is the voice of future regret speaking. This is a peak into your interactions with him from here forward. Were your feelings hurt? Did you feel ignored, disregarded, a sex resource and nothing else? 

I am not talking about your past with him. This is the question you’ll be asking yourself every time in the future that you wonder if marrying him was a bad idea. But by then, of course, you’ll have children and you’ll be too financially afraid to leave him. Do you a favor, do your future and any children in that future a favor. 
Cancel that date. I’m not one for all or none. I don’t usually believe that there’s no middle ground. But when it comes to people who are emotionally and psychologically under-developed in a deep area of his core personality this is one of those things that is taught as well as pre-exists within him to be this way. He doesn’t respect you. And that’s in the early stages of a relationship. It doesn’t get any better from here. If anything it gets worse. Disrespect leads to resentment which leads to emotional abuse which often leads to physical abuse and now you’ve lost 20 to 30 years of your life. Wishing that you could have that time back. I’ve met a lot of women who’ve done this. And they all say the same thing: “I wish I would’ve known how he was back then!”

You mention self-respect. If you wish to value it and truly stand behind it then I strongly urge you to walk away from someone who’s willing to expect and except less."

I got a visit from the police for telling the daycare, because over here there is no public record and “he did his time”. Despite him doing it again after his conviction. He didn’t get arrested again because “no sperm, no crime” despite a staggering amount of evidence and testimonials. Because the police stopped me once, I decided to simply go to the biggest gossip of my old neighbourhood and told her. Not to destroy his life, it’s because he lives in a courtyard with tens of young children.

He did lose his job. He has no place working around possible victims, he studied to be a chef and belongs in a kitchen.

As you can probably tell, I’m still livid. I 100% believe in rehabilitation and helping people but he is being enabled. All he did was serve 3 months in jail in a foreign country and he hasn’t had therapy (at least not during both cases). He doesn’t want to change, he’s still harassing his victims and the police refuses to do anything about it. My “mother” helps him in harassing his victims.

I am also a veterinary specialty nurse of almost 20 years. The advice I am about to give is based on my years around animals, my own experience, and experiences of people I know well. 

1. Although our mothers feel they know best and can be overbearing, they need to keep their unsolicited opinions to themselves. 

2. Dogs are beautiful creatures and I love mine dearly but they are animals. They are and always will be unpredictable, especially in new circumstances. Babies for instance can create stress within the home. Children, once walking, will be at the eye level of a dog and they stare without knowing it. 
This is a sign of aggression in the animal world and horrific accidents can happen.

One of my best friends had a beautiful, sweet lab. She was also a veterinary nurse and when her daughter was born, she kept them separated when she could not supervise dog and baby together. Otherwise allowing them to live among each other. When her daughter was 4, she was alone with this dog for a brief moment, she gave her pup a big hug and looked at him. He then attacked her face and she needed emergency plastic surgery and luckily came out with minor permanent damage. This dog had never given one single sign of aggression. 

This is not common, but it is also not rare by any means. Big dogs or little dogs alike can react in ways we never thought possible. 

When I was pregnant with my first child I knew the power of a big dog and have on multiple occasions during my career, almost been attacked so I can tell the signs of an attack before they happen. I let my 90lb pitbull, who was the kindest dog to date I’ve ever known spend lots of time with baby. But I was also very careful because there was always a worry in my mind. With all the children I made sure he was involved and that his own space was protected from them. He deserved a break of his own too. 

I would suggest reading lots of books and getting in touch with specific, special trainers once your baby is able to move around freely. Always educate yourself on how animals and children interact with one another to prevent any tragic events. 

We owe it to our babies and fur babies alike to teach each one how to appropriately behave with one another. For instance, people who allow their children to climb all over their dogs, or pull on their dogs are not only putting both at risk of injury but not respecting your dogs space and boundaries. 

I wish you the best and I’m sure all will be well. But please be informed."

From the cheating to the threatening to break up and telling you to cancel your flight. She doesn't sound ready to be in any relationship, let alone something as hard as a long distant one.

rel_28386467,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,186,"Legal doesn’t mean it’s not an abuse of power and easily abusive. You’re 22, you probably think you’re “mature for your age”, but you’re not, that’s not a real thing, you’re young and immature because that’s what a 22 year old is. Maturity comes with time and experience. 

Not all age gaps are problematic, if you were a fully grown adult and say 30, then a person 10 years older isn’t a mismatch because you’re in the same life stage. But at 22 you are easy to manipulate because you have no life or relationship experience. You say you wanted someone mature to marry but you are dating a 34 year old man who’s not mature at all, you are too ignorant and inexperienced to even know what maturity is.

Your boyfriend is with you because you let him treat you terribly because you simply don’t know any better. Someone his age would never put up with any of his shit because they’ve had the time and experience to learn what is and isn’t normal or ok in a relationship and they expect better for themselves."

rel_30885725,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,322,"&gt; You should apologize to Mark. I would write him a letter and have a friend deliver it. A handwritten letter is so much more personal than anything electronic. He deserves at least that.

This is creepy, invasive, and rude. If someone accused me of rape half a decade ago I would be absolutely enraged if a random stranger **showed up to my house** unannounced just to give me a fucking letter. 

A hand-written letter is comforting from my grandmother. Not someone I haven’t heard from in years who caused me immense harm. I’m not thinking, “Oh how *personal*”, I’d be thinking “How the fuck do they know where I live.” Especially if I’m home and see them walk up to my door? 

How would I even know it’s the real person apologizing and not someone trying to bait me into some kind of entrapment scheme? I have no idea who actually wrote a random letter or what intentions they have or why they’ve apparently lost their mind &amp; forgot cell phones exist. 

It’s 2022. Text messages have been around for almost 30 years. I at least know it’s most likely the actual person. I can choose to reply. If they message on social media, I can block them if I don’t want to respond. 

Do not under any circumstances send a stranger to someone’s house to deliver anything. Especially if you hurt them and especially if they haven’t contacted you in years. It’s probably because they don’t wanna talk to you. And someone who doesn’t want to talk to you definitely will not appreciate the anxiety of knowing the person who hurt you knows where you live and came to your house. Just be a normal person and send a damn text or DM. I’m not tryin to get Fatal Attracted &amp; I don’t wanna worry about finding a rabbit boiling on my stove the next time I come home lol."

rel_1031229,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,387,"Many great points! i will try to answer some of them

&gt;Are you two genuinely okay knowing the other believes differently and will, by course of action, act differently?

I've always been fine with the fact that she is a believer and I am not. Thusfar, it hasn't affected how we act towards one another. However, it doesn't seem that she's fully ok with me being agnostic (though i have been transparent about it early on). It seems to bother her more in recent times than it did in the earliest stages of our relationship.

&gt;Are you two genuinely okay knowing one will go to church while the other stays at home?

I'm willing to go to church, with the understanding that im most likely just going to keep up appearances and go through the motions. I love her that much

&gt;Will this difference in beliefs cause impacts in sex and communication?

So far, it has not

&gt;How will the difference in beliefs affect decisions with money?

So far, it has not

&gt;How are you going to raise your kids?

This is the golden question! I would say this is the thing that is perplexing us so much.

I am fine with them going to church. I just don't want to have to blatantly lie to them. I feel like, with or without church, my children will be indoctrinated to an extent. It's just a product of the society we live in. It's very unfortunate, because i feel like concepts such as God, sin, death, heaven, hell, and eternity are just too heavy for young children. It's not fair that it's immediately in their face from a young age.. even if they aren't in church.

on the other side of that, i also don't want to be a father who does the opposite (e.g. ""sorry, kid. there is no god. they are all lying to you""). i think it has to be their own personal journey that will lead them to a true conclusion on the validity of a supreme being. and i think we all have a very personal and different journey. As for how to raise them with this in mind? I have no idea. I hope i (and my SO) can always just strive to have open, and non-judgmental communication lines with our children"

You literally told us that your dad knew people on the inside and got you full custody. Do you know how rare it is for one parent to get full custody? And make ALLLLLLL legal, medical, school decisions himself? They are extreme cases. We’re talking heavy drug use, abuse, and oh wait….. SEXUAL ASSAULT OF A MINOR. Hey that’s crazy, didn’t your *dad* do that? Your mother is concerned because she knew she was with a pedophile once she reached a certain age. Now she was in a marriage where he knew everyone in town. She KNEW that if she left, this is what he would do. Your mother was groomed and statutory raped by a man in his 30s when she was a CHILD!!!!!! You are a COUPLE YEARS away from being the age she was when she was preyed on by your father. Pedophiles don’t stop being pedophiles one day. They don’t EVER stop. And they don’t care if you are related to them, they will STILL rape and molest you. Being a pedophile is extremely disgusting, vile, and fucked up. So do you really think that’s the only fucked up thing he’s ever done? People like him have TONS of issues. I don’t care how many times a day your mother calls you. Your father is a fucking psycho, not your mother. She is extremely scared for your safety and life. Please please please take these comments seriously and recognize that your mothers whole entire life and youth was stolen from her. She is a victim.

rel_19475797,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,377,"I would advise not only POA to begin with, but someone needs to step up as her guardian when the time comes. I had POA for my mom and took over paying her bills for her. She had a neuro cognitive /dementia screening with a neuropsychologist. The doctor could not believe she was still living alone and especially driving. On her advice we took my mothers car away and sold it, depositing the money for it into her savings account. At that time, I had POA. She was pissed (kicked mo out of her house etc.) and said she would go out and buy herself another car. Now, I was 4 hrs away from home so I went to a hotel. The next morning I got an attorney and was in court for her county to obtain temporary guardianship. All I had to was explained to the judge why I needed guardianship and he granted it. Guardianship meant that I had control of her bank accounts. I spent the rest of the day visiting all the banks she did business with to close accounts and have the funds electronically transferred into a guardian account. Returned to her house after setting up help for her, (taking her to get groceries, have her hair done, a few groups she belonged to etc.). Turns out she wasn't even capable of getting a grocery list made. Nor cleaning out her refrigerator. I was in contact with her main caregiver 2x/week for updates. 
I am granted permanent guardianship a month later. A year later move her into a very nice 2 br apartment in an assisted living facility. That was another fight involved calling the police to take her to the facility. She ended up slugging a nurse, who was helping her dress, a few years later, apparently just for the hell of it. 
The whole dementia thing I would not wish on anybody, either as a victim or a caretaker. 
When she died, so many people who had known her, but not seen her in the past decade sent their condolences. Honestly, by that time I was just so done. My mother died years before her body did. By the time she died, she was not the mother I had known."
rel_29551162,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,228,"Before I had to stop therapy because of the pandemic, I was taking a DBT class that focused on using Mindfulness to help maintain our emotions. If I was thinking something negative? Once I catch myself doing so, I replace it with a positive. For example: 

&gt; feel like I’m unlovable, overly emotional and like I can’t control my emotional responses

""I feel unlovable, but I realistically know this isn't true. I have people in my life who love me. Everyone struggles with emotions at some point, so I need to be more accepting of myself the way I would be if my loved one felt this way. My emotions feel hard to control, but I am learning to do so. ""

If I became overwhelmed with anxiety, or negative thoughts, and *couldn't* come up with the positives I needed, I would do an activity and say every action I was doing.

"" I am taking the pan out of the cabinet. I am quickly washing it. I am drying it off.."" ect. 

There should be some self-led mindfulness teachings online for you to work with if you can't see a therapist. I admit it can feel pretty silly at first before you get used to it, but I have found it has helped me a lot when it comes to controlling my emotions and reflecting on them."
rel_1029959,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,258,"In addition to drivingthroaway's *excellent* advice which I really hope you follow, I'd also add -- as someone who was also in an abusive relationship -- one thing to be aware of is that survivors of abusive relationships (myself included) have often had their independent coping skills stripped away by the abuse.

What that means is that we can be very vulnerable to search for a ""rescuer,"" someone to fill the hole of control left by the absence of the abuser. That person may fill it in a kind, supportive and caring way -- but it essentially still comes down to switching one type of dependence (an abusive dependence) for another.

So absolutely, it's *incredibly* good that you have a friend who you feel is supportive of you. But when you get out -- and you will, and you will get on your feet and I believe absolutely in you -- one of the most valuable things you can do to heal is continue building your own ability to assert yourself independently, to have effective self-sufficient coping strategies, and to be able to claim your own power.

So that's the value in not being over-reliant on this friend. I'm glad he's there to support you. I hope he continues to be. But when you get out it's going to be very important to ensure you're not leaning on him entirely to carry you through -- because the best thing you can do for yourself is re-learn and heal the independence that your abuser has taken away from you."
rel_2539106,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,218,"I'm so sorry to hear that. :( That sounds so hard. Honestly, if you've already put yourself out there multiple times, expressed your feelings, and she has her mind made up, I would recommend maybe thinking about doing the same thing-I.E., working on yourself. As much as this might hurt to hear, when you put yourself in your ex's presence day in and day out, you're not allowing yourself to process the breakup. Additionally, you're not giving her a chance to miss you-not that it should be about that, but think about it. She's still getting all of the emotional support, affection, and validation from you, with no commitment. And if she's going and visiting another guy, and telling you about it, you're torturing yourself. You sound like you have a good heart. Don't do that to yourself. Let yourself be happy. 
I would suggest removing yourself for a little while. Work on yourself. Find new hobbies. Make yourself happy. Let her notice your absence. Maybe she'll miss you terribly. Maybe she'll beg for you to come back. Maybe she won't. Maybe you'll have a change of heart. Que sera sera. Let go with love and know everything will work out, everything will be okay, and the future is uncertain, but someone, somewhere will reciprocate your love someday. "
rel_13802750,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,266,"Hey there buckaroo, my father died twenty years ago when I was just a kid too. First let me tell you - This is going to hurt and it will hurt for a while. It will take a bit for you to get out of the shock state, it'll probably be the smallest thing that makes it real, but when that happens all the emotions that hit you will come out hard and ugly. Don't force it, let it come naturally. If and when it does, don't hide or suppress it, just find your own corner of comfort and let it all out. 

I won't lie to you, it will never really get better but it will get easier. You will miss him, no way around that, and at times you will wonder what could've been and how it would be like, and during those times you will be sad. The best memories will hurt the most, but make sure you cherish them. Know that life does go on though. Soon enough you will grow older, days will come and go, you won't even notice it. Allow time to pass, don't force anything. Soon enough you will learn to cope with it.

I do recommend having someone to talk with. Not about your father or his death, but about anything. When my uncle died, who was like a second father to me, my good friends and I went to the game store and played games the entire day. It helps because you feel normal again. I promise you, time will seal that wound. Best of luck."

rel_1002503,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,387,"I don't think *you* know how loans work. When the op asks mom to co-sign, OP is saying ""I will pay this loan, I need you to agree that I am responsible enough to take on a loan, so responsible that you would bet on it, the bet being that you take on the loan if I can't"" when mom takes out a loan she is saying ""I am going to pay back this loan, instead of putting the burden on my child"" OP knew mom wouldn't pay back the loan, which is why OP was trying to make it their responsibility instead of mom's by having mom co-sign, not take out, a loan.

there was no discussion of where the extra money went or who spent it, I see absolutely no implication that OP did, though we can assume that yes, the loan was spent. 

now why would OP pay the bank $8000? this statement just straight up confuses me. to you mean save the 8000$? that's what I did with my extra, saved, gained intrest, borrowed less extra next time. or do you mean returning the extra money to the gov't, who lent it out?

here's a big difference in the story. had OP taken out the loans they planned, with mom co-signing, they would have paid it back, same as they are paying back thir own loans. Mom did not pay the loans back, and has therefore gained more interest than OP would have otherwisely had to deal with. This is why it is not the same as OP getting the co-signed loan. interest, great interest.

OP should return the $12,000 to mom, $20,000 if the extra did not go to mom (see extra loan money is given out by the school as refund checks, and depending on the school they are writen to either the student, or whoever took out the loan, so there is a chance that extra money went into mom's pocket.) if anything. However the extra interest is not OP's fault, and I still believe that when mom took out her own loan, she was doing so to take burden off the child, and that was her gift, taking on the burden of the payments herself, and therefore OP doesn't *owe* her anything, just could repay as a thank you."

Let her know that you can live in a trailer you found on craigslist for $500.  It needs some work, but it's *not a big deal*.  You even found a place out in the woods where you can park it for free.  Did he mention how much he loves the outdoors.  No running water, but there is a river near, she can just carry it to the trailer in a bucket.  It'll be just like living in the wild west!  Totally cool!  And you can poop in the woods just like the animals.

Don't forget to throw in tons of ""I love you SO MUCH!"" and call her non stop.  

Keep it as legit and as ""possible"" as you can, and be totally serious.  Get upset if she tries to back off.  Cry if you can.  Crying on the phone is even better.  Swear things will get better, you are spending all your spare cash on lottery tickets.

rel_17014569,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,227,"Ok, so your girlfriend's friends are worse than the relationship advice subreddit if they told her to break up with you over this. 

You guys agree that flirting is cheating, do you guys think that K cheated with all the boys since she sent them all the same flirty message? Should J break up with K? I feel like you guys might answer no. 

 It's very obvious from the telling of the story that you had no intention of actually flirting with or hooking up with K. You were just playing a game, a game I still frankly don't understand. So while one detail shows flirtiness(the messages themselves) there was no actual intention to flirt. So no cheating occurred here. 

If there is some plot twist where you knew K from high school and had secretly hooked up with her at prom and spent days leading up to the game night texting each other while telling everyone you are ""just friends"", then maybe. Otherwise, the fact that you have been fighting over this for 2 days is ridiculous. 

I guess the real question is does your girlfriend want to break up with you? If she does then it won't matter what logic any of us bring to the table. If she doesn't then she is putting you through the wringer for her own personal form of torture."

From the outside looking in it was a brilliant relationship. 6 years in and she did a 180 from no where. Abuse, gaslighting etc etc followed for 2 years. One day I had enough and upped and left and never looked back. It didn't take me long to get myself together as I guess I was going through the break up during the last 2 years of our relationship. I thought I could never ever live without her and that she was the one and that I'd never ever be as happy with anyone else or without her!!! I was very wrong!! I have never been happier. Basically after all that what I'm trying to say is that once you treat her right and give her everything she asks of you then I think that's ok. She's happy and you're happy to have found a decent companion. You can both be happy without each other too!!

rel_6836248,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,420,"She, uh, doesn't owe you anything. Which is a hard thing to swallow, but it's true. She likes her new guy, she's interested in him, and everything else is taking a back seat. Her flimsy excuses are your showing you what she's like. She probably also is aware you'll not like her focusing on someone else. Perhaps in the past *you* were more of her focus, but that's changed now. She still doesn't owe that to you, her wants can change, her focus can change, she's her own person and you cannot control her or what she does.

I guarantee if you send that 10 page document, or let her look at it or whatever, you're going to alienate her. You're going to start a fight and ruin your friendship. Next time you're with her, just casually say, 'Hey, is it okay if we put our phones away when we hang out? I feel like we don't really get to spend quality time together like we have before.' Easy. Don't make it into a huge deal. It's not. You're asking for her time and energy, you can't demand it. 

You're basically stewing on anger and resentment here and not communicating with her at all, and you think dumping all this information on her is going to.. what? She's not going to apologise and mend her ways. She's interested in a guy, and your throwing a tantrum is going to be too much to deal with. She will feel attacked, she won't read the whole thing most likely, and she'll turn around and get angry at why you won't support her etc. Airing out all your grievances is going to make you feel bad too, by the by. You'll come away feeling worse and you'll have lost her. Less worse than that, you guys drift apart and you're not close friends. But telling her 'you're not my best friend anymore, you're just a friend' is *so middle school* I can't even. You're an adult. And people change over time. In fact 18-25 is the time that people change *the most* mentally. 

Also you're jealous of Joe and you need to let yourself acknowledge that, and then get over it if you want to remain in this girl's life. She'll have other boyfriends, she'll focus on them too. She's allowed to spend as much time with him as she likes, it's her life, she doesn't owe you her time *no matter how much effort you've put in*. That's just how life is."
rel_652482,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,231,"This is why staying ""friends"" with former partners tends to be a bad idea.  The real problem here is that while you technically ended the relationship, you really didn't.  You still kept talking to each other (likely about emotional and intimate things), you still visited her, and you even still had sex with her.  The reason you are jealous is because regardless of your official status, your brain thinks you are in a relationship and feel like she is leaving you for another guy.

Obviously you might want to take this as a sign that you need to put a lot of distance between the two of you.  You need to actually end your relationship.  Since I doubt you would listen to me if I told you to cut all contact, you need to at least cut certain types of contact immediately.  

First of all, never have sex or anything close.  Second, don't visit her besides once in a blue moon.  Third, while it is fine to talk about things, avoid intimate or personal discussions.  You shouldn't be the person she talks to after a hard day or about your feelings.  Keep it to things like books, news, movies, and more general topics of conversation that you might have with a coworker or new friend.  Fourth, move on.  Start looking for a new girlfriend to spend you time and energy on."
rel_38267847,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,230,"....this isn't a good sign, hon. I'm sorry. I was in an abusive relationship that started off just like this.

Everything seemed pretty normal, we bickered but usually resolved it. And then while making light of a disagreement we were having, he started hitting me with the Subway sandwich bag he was carrying. Just hard enough to make a point, without being so hard it would draw attention from others.

I know. It's ludicrous. Who hits someone with a lunch bag for any reason? Ever? It would have been funny, except that I saw his eyes. I cannot describe what I saw there, but I knew one thing for sure--*he meant it.*

Right now your BF is testing your boundaries to see just how much garbage you are willing to tolerate. (See: frog in a boiling pot analogy). Then he'll amp it up more. 

A common mistake is to believe that abusive relationships are rare, or only look a certain way. Please do not fall into this trap.

What clinched it for me though, was his reaction. He doesn't care that he hurt you. That's why you're still upset, but you need to realize *why* he doesn't care---because ***hurting you was the point all along.***

This won't get better. I'm sorry. Just know it's not your fault, I don't care if you folded his socks into an origami middle finger."

She was allowed to keep male ""friends"" but I couldn't even have female friends at work, just as coworker friends. 

The word ""friend"" to woman(some/most?) Is code for I already slept with him, I'm currently sleeping with him, or I plan to sleep with him in the future .

The guy I caught her in an affair with in may, was just a friend. I have the protection orders and her writing on them to prove she claims he was just a friend.

I told the guys wife less than 6 hours later I had protection orders out on me, she filed for 100% emergency custody of our son. Told them I'm suicidal. So. I got a mental health evaluation, 3 court dates down, 1 more to go, I'm paying $90 a week to see a counselor to help me through this. I don't want a counselor, but she jammed me up so good, it just looks better to do it.

Oh, and the friend dumped her to save his marriage. 


So, put your foot down and stand your ground more. Her true colors will come out, she won't like it if you tell her she can't have opposite sex friends if you can't, but it might save you some time and hassle In the future.


People will always have opposite sex friends, just be Leary of the one who has them but says you can't. Its a red flag I should not have ignored...lol"

Today I wouldn’t let him be affectionate with me, I’m very hurt that he did this to me. He asked me calmly if I wanted space etc. and I told him I think so. Since we are on lock down due to COVID 19 I don’t think it’s a good idea to go see a therapist right now, so what do you suggest things we do in order to heal and be together. I asked him this morning if he could answer questions, I asked if he wants us to end and he said no, that he loves me. The other day he was crying so much when I told him that it broke my heart to see those messages. I was so hurt. He told me those were his mistakes. So I’m hoping he does prove to me that he won’t do that again. I told him if I ever find out that he does that again I will not get back together with him, I made that clear to him."

Then one day she just said “I can never love you as much as you love me” and she ended it. It was horrible. Because my whole life was about her I didn’t just lose a girlfriend, I lost myself. We tried it again later, but she was still in a bad place and broke it off again. I was sad for years, but the second time she ended it, I didn’t blame myself. I realized that her health and life are her responsibility not mine. And then I finally allowed myself to be angry for all the times I showed her endless support but never got any.

He’s already told you she looked familiar and she also gave her response. Everything else is your skepticism. Your liberal use of quotation marks and your reasoning about him leaving his wallet all point towards your doubt. 

You obviously have little trust in anything your sister says. And that has poisoned your view of him. I don’t know if he’s done anything to damage your trust with him or maybe your sister has snagged one of your men in the past, but you obviously don’t believe either of them and are here looking for support for your doubts so you can continue being worried and suspicious. 

Nothing either of them say at this point will make it better. This little seed of doubt will form a wedge between you and your bf.

I usually try to be positive and supportive, but your running on pure suspicion. There are no texts, pictures, or confirmation from people that know them. Without anything like that, you’re just sabotaging your relationship. "

(Stalin later turned on them and executed as many as he could and he was actually making plans to ship the remaining Jews to Siberia before he died.)

Figure out his love language.

On the topic of suspicious activity, have you ever brought it up? Asked why he needs Tinder if he has a girlfriend?

Accepting it and saying nothing tends to make it seem like he can get away with that.

I think a good heart to heart is needed between you and him and what you want out of the relationship. Because as the relationship matures and changes so does your expectations.

rel_27950497,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,225,"At your age the difference in life experience of a 24yo who has been out in the world with a job, looking after yourself, and having had to deal with the things that life and people and relationships (not all of them pleasant) throw at you, can make a big difference in your wants and needs and thought processes.  You, at 18yo, are new to much of it and may not be as aware of the differences or when you are being used or manipulated.  So Yes, there can be some dangers in dating someone 6 years older.  

However, if you approach it with a sensible head on your shoulders, maintain a good support network of friends and family around you, and can say ""No"" to someone you are romantically interested in if they're asking you to do something you arent completely comfortable with, then sure, I think you can give it a go.  Don't be surprised if it becomes obvious that the two of you want very different things in life - or if he only wants one thing. Be careful, be safe, and a sensible exit plan for any dates and let people know where you are and where you are going and with whom. All the usual safety precautions really.

As a new couple she needs to learn to give each other time.

She needs to put all that extra time in a hobby, a job, spending time with her friends &amp; family. And you need to be willing to point this out to her.

Too much time with someone, especially in a new relationship can possibly burn you out. This needs to be brought up in conversation &amp; if she isn't willing to compromise you need to kick her to the curb. Especially if these are major red flag for you, Which they are."

Is someone’s potential something you should look for in a relationship? Absolutely yeah. It’s not wrong to not want to be with a deadbeat. But their potential isn’t what characterizes them as them. Get to know the person, figure out how they operate and if you want to claw your own eyes out being with that person or not. 

Sometimes people have great potential, but end up throwing it away or be a terrible person to you and that’s what you should look out for. If they have great potential, and you actually like being around them, then I’d say go for it."
rel_10877467,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,370,"I don't have any actual experience with this issue, so maybe take my comment with a grain of salt. But as I write this no one else has said anything yet, so I'll give it my best shot.

According to your post it sounds like your gf is maintaining friendships with people she was previously romantically involved with. On its own this has a chance to be bad. Then you say she's talking to them daily. How often do you talk with your platonic friends (male or female)? I chat with my friends maybe once a week, though if we were the Snapchat type I might send at least one image every day to maintain a streak. So the frequency is potentially suspicious, though not necessarily.

The use of Snapchat seems a bit suspicious on its own (since you won't be able to read their texts), but it really only counts in combination with other factors.

The thing that concerns me is this:

&gt; there has been times where I feel she swipes super quickly or hides the phone when I come in the room 

If this is true, it seems that she's intentionally hiding stuff from you, which is a pretty solid bad sign.

I think the first thing you need to do is have a more serious talk with her. Why is she Snapping them every single day? Why is she trying to hide it from you when you enter the room? Obviously you *want* to believe you're the only guy she's interested in, but when she's Snapping other guys every single day (which IMO is a lot more intimate than texting) you're having a tough time.

Another thing that might help you is to meet the guys. Once you've met them you should be able to tell if they seem like they're trying to get with her or if they're as platonic about it as she claims they are. Who knows, one of them might even become a good friend.

Just going to end this comment by repeating the note at the start: I have no experience with this issue, so my advice may be incorrect. If you take it, you do so at your own risk."

Learn to cook if you don't know how, get a dog or a cat, find hobbies u want to explore, and maybe one day just one day.. when you done one of these things ull meet someone by accident. Just keep talking to people in the meantime, strike a conversation to anyone, especially girls without having the intention to date them, but rather be interested in what kind of people they are. To conclude, hope this helps and never give up man. U rather live life doing the things ur heart wants to do regardless of what's the circumstances or outcomes.

You're on the bounce, I'm sorry to say. Been there myself. More than once. You'll make bad decisions (""my impression is to trust ...

Just stop it. Please. Seriously. Tell him you're not dating right now, that you never date people at work, and tell him to take you off Facebook.

All of the points you made are things I have mulled over in my head, but I don’t end up committing to telling him I love him (I do) because ultimately I’m afraid to be vulnerable and get hurt. But I think the alternative of just breaking things off without fully communicating/leaving question marks would be a bigger mistake.

Agreed that there may be an underlying reason he hasn’t said it, or maybe he is waiting for me. What I have struggled with is feeling like I’m the only one pushing the relationship along (I was the one who asked for exclusivity when we first met, I was the one who asked that we be in an official relationship, and I was the one who brought up marriage the one time we talked about it).

It sucks, it really does, but that's just how it is sometimes, and it's nobody's fault.
But I don't think that matters as much as you think it does. Or, at least, it has as much value as you decide to place on it, but the end point is it doesn't matter. The relationship is over, and knowing why she broke up with you isn't going to make you feel any better, nor is it going to prevent you from ""making the same mistake"".
Most things heal with time, and I'm confident that this is one of those things. It may not feel like it now, but I promise you it will pass with time. See a therapist if you have to.

Think about the end point of that line of thinking: You're afraid that if she fake-kisses another man as part of an acting scene, she'll enjoy it so much that she'll throw 3 years with you away to have an affair with him.

That's kind of insulting to her, as it assumes she's got a very fickle mindset and lacks commitment to you.

Certainly I understand feeling *some* jealousy, but relationships are about faith. Have some faith that your GF can handle this without the kiss acting as a magic spell that makes her run away with him. The kiss isn't about romantic feelings.

When someone you love cheats on you it’s a traumatic experience that can take a long time to recover from. My best advice is to set yourself a little time initially where you’ve got no expectations on yourself at all other than to keep breathing. Take a day or two from work and make sure you’re somewhere safe and comfortable for you  (parents are great sanctuaries for this or close friends). Once that day or two is up then you’re going to have to start re-building a lot of your life one day at a time.
It sounds cliched, but it will 100% get easier. Even more so if you have a good support network around you.
Use this opportunity as a bit of fuel to get your goals in work / fitness too as there’s no revenge more sweet than a life well lived.

rel_12420429,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,288,"Get a lawyer. He will have to petition the court where you live for a paternity hearing. A judge will court order a dna test. He will likely need to pay for it. You won’t have to see him, you’ll bring the baby to a lab by yourself and they will swab her cheek with a cotton swab. When the results come back, and the baby is his, the judge will award him paternity. Depending on the court and the petition made by his lawyer, they may give him visitation at this hearing, or they may schedule another hearing to decide that. 

Unless he has a criminal record, or a drug problem, he’ll get visitation at least, but he’ll also have to start paying child support. You can have your lawyer push for a “breaking in” period of supervised visitation where someone you trust can stay and watch them until your daughter is comfortable with him.  You don’t have to be there and you certainly don’t have to get back together with him.

If you live in another state, he’s going to have to do all of this through a lawyer in your state and he’s going to have to show up in court in person. If he gets supervised visitation, it will have to be local to you. Depending on how far away you are, he may not have the time, energy, or money to do any of it. The good news is that if he does jump through all those hoops it’s a good indication that he’s serious about being a good dad to your daughter.

rel_28455214,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,244,"So, my (27F) partner (29F) also snores very loudly due to sleep apnea. You have already received good advice about sleep studies/going to a doctor for a CPAP, etc (which you should definitely do!), but I wanted to share the system we use that honestly works for both of us. Our quality of our relationship has improved greatly.

Basically, we will spend the evening together in the main bedroom, watching tv, cuddling, talking about our days, any, ahem, adult activities, etc. She goes to sleep earlier than me, so when she mentions she is going to try to sleep, I kiss her goodnight and head to our other bedroom, which I have kind of taken over and made my own.

Society has the general conception that long-term couples/married couples should always sleep in the same room/bed, and that they have an unhealthy relationship if they don’t, but this isn’t true at all. We are very happy with this arrangement. We both get better sleep, she doesn’t have any guilt about something she can’t control, and I am able to have my important decompression/alone time in my room (I have ADHD). In addition, I’ve been able to make the room a little bit of my own, with decorations, style, etc, so we each have a space that feels like “ours” in our apartment.

rel_30469526,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,283,"You have a lot on your plate. It sounds exhausting *without* the demands of a committed relationship. 

Communication is key. And I don't mean wait until an issue surfaces. You need to re-evaluate your free time. Make sure you have time for yourself as well, to decompress. Your current workload is temporary, but you still have to take care of your mental, physical and emotional well being, in the meantime. Sit down and discuss all of this, before it blows up and is no longer salvageable. Stop with the bedtime stories for now, she can utilize the many apps available for this very thing. Or limit it to one night a week (then its more of treat, less of a routine). She may be patient, but if she doesn't empathize with the stress you are under, and you continue like this, you are going to pay the price, and the relationship will inevitably fail anyway. 

If you don't communicate, she can't know what you're thinking or feeling, and you aren't giving her the opportunity to be supportive. Waiting to talk(argue) when emotions are in a tangled mess, is not effective. Arguing and sweeping it under the rug adds up over time. You need to set up some boundaries for self care. If you are exhausted all the time, of course you are going to get snappy. And I'm sure that doesn't make either of you feel good. And its exactly one of the things that needs to be communicated ""I don't like getting to a point of exhaustion that I'm snapping at you and feeling impatient. Especially because its not about you. I need some time to relax and shut off my brain."""
rel_11719722,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,361,"Thank you! Your comment is really helpful and gets at the crux of the issue. Some other people called it envy, but it isnt that simple. I dont mind him getting praise, and I feel like I generally get positive feedback on my main work... but it was jarring to get no direct positive feedback from someone like my supervisor, especially when she *looked* impressed. How hard is it to say something? 

It could just be her personality though. She gives praise but doesnt *gush,* which normally doesnt bother me. Maybe it just didnt occur to her to say something at all in this case. I'm someone who's sensitive to noticing when people feel left out in social situations, and do what I can to include them. If I had two underlings, Id give them feedback on something as big as those presentations were regardless... but especially if I noticed one was getting a lot of outside feedback and the other wasnt.

I still dont know if its worth saying anything to anyone. I dont want to seem petty. Im guess Im extra sensitive because I had something kind of similar happen in my last workplace - but in that case the person actually was a really solid employee I enjoyed working with. The only thing that bothered me in that situation was people *constantly* talking about her, and casually comparing her to me, to my face. I was a really good employee then too, she just had some skills I didnt. In this current situation, Im the one with more skills but the other person is still ""winning"" the praise game, lol.

Which, it's not a game or a competition! But Im guilty of having ""scarcity mentality"" at times, lol. It just disturbs me to see praise given for an average/below average performance when I put in so much work to make a great performance, but youre right, I should just see it as them trying to boost up someone who *needs* the boost.

It also helps that someone approached me on their own today and said I did a great job &amp; my presentation was really informative. Yay 🙃"
rel_8444137,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,254,"You’re out of the honeymoon phase... I made the same mistake when I was about 24 and married... I thought that because I wasn’t feeling that excitement anymore that I didn’t love him... I’m happy with my life now but I’m a little older and wiser and look back and think I should’ve tried harder. 

That feeling you get when you’re really into someone and it’s new thats lust not love... that’s like mental illness. You think things you wouldn’t normally, act in ways that isn’t like you. You’re fiercely defensive and at times very jealous... all that craziness is done with now and you two can just get on with deepening your connection to each. Work on strengthening your bond. 

This is a really good time in your relationship... that fun part at the beginning it doesn’t last but you see people in their 90s still together and happy... my nan and pa were in their 90s and their connection was so strong, when pa died, nan following him just a week later. Ask your grandparents and or your parents about this.

This is something I was only told recently. Love is a choice, not a feeling.

I really wish I knew that sooner. Hang in there. The only reason I could see you guys breaking up over is that one of you grows and changes or you grow apart but not after a year... just hold on. Talk to him, get to know him and ask yourself; do you love his soul?"
rel_867456,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,456,"&gt;. And if she makes the choice to take a pregnancy to full term in the case of rape, she has the right to do that. But, in that scenario, I really don't think it's fair for the man to be able to opt out of paying child support. He raped her

Again, rape is a lot trickier, and I honestly haven't thought it through entirely.  Most of my thought has been ""legal paternal surrender"" in non-rape cases.   

&gt; it doesn't mean that she should suffer the consequences of an action that she had no power over.

One would argue that actually having the child is really the only ""consequence"" that is permanent and that she is choosing not to fix.   

On one hand, I obviously see the (that I personally think would be very rare) case where the mother does want to keep the child, and as such, should be able to support it **properly**.  

On the other, I see potential room for abuse (rape is already the highest falsely accused crime by about 4x)... it doesn't need more incentive.   Making a special exception in the case of rape would just be a bad idea in my opinion after taking into account this reason. 

Secondly, the rapist will probably be in prison... where's this money coming from?    Personally, I would be for government assistance.   

I don't know, as I said, I really need to think on it more, but those are my initial (and jumbled) thoughts on it. 

&gt;But, like, if a the man needs to give consent to take care of the child, as described by OP, would he not also need to give consent to terminate the pregnancy?


Two things:

1) I think that consent would at least be assumed to start, and it's only until the father chooses to ""opt out"" that it's assumed he will have no responsibility to the child.  

2) No they would not need his consent to terminate the pregnancy.   It's still her body.   The father choosing to opt out of financial help and fatherly roles is not actually forcing the mother to do anything.  It's just allowing the mother to make a choice after being informed of new information.     If she wants to have it she still can, and if she wants to abort it she can... the only difference is that she won't be getting the fathers legally obligated help.    

But requiring the fathers consent in order to abort, is actually putting the choice directly in his hands. As I already said, it's still her body.  

&gt;Haha, I was asking all those question to try and point out what's wrong with that... In retrospect, I should have been more definitive about my own opinions. 

it's okay. "
rel_8904732,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,461,"There’s a lot to unpack here. I get that high school is a hard time and they everyone is insecure and everything but that doesn’t mean you should let someone control your life. Some people on this post are saying that Carla is an instigator but all she has done, according to OP, is sit by him and text him a few times. If you have any thought that Carla might be egging this on talk to her and ask her to clarify her intentions. It can be as easy as “Hey, we’ve known each other a long time and we’re good friends, but Jane thinks there’s something going on between us, to be clear you’re not into me like that, right?” You have every right to be friends with someone of your preferred gender. 

 Jane is insecure and I get it, I was a 17 year old girl who thought that the world was against me at one point, too. Jane needs to understand that you can’t just rely on her to fulfill all of your needs as a functioning human, by which I mean you have to have friends. Different friends fill different niches. I have friends that I go to when I need logic and I have friends I go to when I need my emotions validated. All of these people are important for a strong support network. 

Talk to Jane. The most important thing in a relationship is communication. It sounds like the most over used phrase in the world but it’s true. Tell her that you want to remain friends with Carla and that you have no interest in her romantically. Tell her that she needs to better communicate her feelings (which can be hard) but can start with something as simple as “This upsets me because...” or “I feel that...” find out why she thinks that you would (pardon the ancient phrase that sounds better than cheating) step out on her with Carla. 

If all else fails and she doesn’t get better about communicating consider taking a step back. I know you’ve been with her for a couple of years and I know you love her but you both deserve to be in happy, healthy relationships and it’s clear that she currently doesn’t trust you and that should probably worry you a bit because if she doesn’t trust you than what does she think of you as a person. 

Don’t let the relationship drag on if it doesn’t have trust and communication. Don’t play games with her because it’s an exhausting waste of time, effort, and emotion. Don’t sell yourself short, and if it gets to that point, don’t breakup over text/phone/at school. Try to show her the level of respect that you would want."
rel_26128210,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,417,"So, first off, way to bury the lead to my fellow commenters and to you OP.

This isn’t about nudity, and least not mostly.  

This wasn’t her and small group of trusted friends going skinny dipping together….this was her establishing as an incoming freshman her position as the ultra-“free spirited”, life of the party, I’ll do anything for a reaction person.  She did this not because she’s comfortable with her body, it’s because she wanted everyone to know how much she doesn’t give a fuck and how much she is willing to do to entertain others.

She probably told you thinking it was a brag of how much she doesn’t give a fuck, and you know what, to many, it will make her cool, she will be invited to parties, many girls and guys will want to be her friend….but they will expect her to be that person all the time.  What your saying here is, she probably can be that person, and probably wants to be that person, at least for a while.

Dude, she’s a new freshman who is the “no rules” life of the party.  I was one of those, as a dude, but still a pretty good looking and witty dude, who was terribly inappropriate, but in a very fun loving and non-threatening way….flat out, if this is the persona she wants to put out there, the person she is going to be to make friends, there will be expectations of her.  Many of my friends of both sexes were like this as well, and I can say, that lifestyle doesn’t really work with monogamous relationships.  

Again, I put myself in that group early in college, like a lot of freshman also do, I don’t know a single damn one of them us, at least who wasn’t the crazy funny fat dude, that didn’t do something’s you shouldn’t do in a relationship, or break up with their SO before they did that.  

That’s okay too, none of us planned it, or did it premeditatedly, we were just figuring ourselves and this world out.  She’s finding her new life, the new her….I’m sure this version of her will get replaced as well….but not by the old version, it’ll be something different than both.  This is one of those things that happen when you go to uni, at least for some.  

Maybe this is enough to break up over, maybe not, but get your heart ready in either case, some changes are coming my friend."
rel_34046802,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,265,"OP, although her attendance at parties without you is innocent enough, you have let her know that it makes you feel uncomfortable.  It's a precedence to allow her to be seen in a compromising situation and she HAS prioritized her friends over you.

To keep her, have a discussion about boundaries and what is acceptable and not.  You must both agree and support this limitation.  If you cannot both agree, end the relationship.  As innocent as it MIGHT be, it will cause friction between you two.

Advise her that you are not denying her anything, if she can't make that commitment then she is not for you and you are better off breaking up.  Despite this possibly being a great relationship, it takes dedication, commitment, and trust from both of you equally and not just one sided.

I feel for you, OP, and hope that you can find a solution, one way or another, that you can be happy with.  Don't be her safety net when she wishes to be with her friends, if you can't go for whatever reason, then reschedule, or not go.  She may not go for it, which will let you know what her true priorities are.

My last warning, I hope will never apply to you, but follow up on any suspicious behavior, this is a serious red flag, that even if she agrees she will be tempted to break it.  Have some support system/conditions to warn you of anything and act on it.  She may make a bad decision to lie to you, so catch her.

Good luck, OP"
rel_20125176,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,261,"I find people who are constantly insecure about everything really annoying, no matter their gender. Everyone has insecurities, but I don't want every day to be about that. I've been used as free therapy for so long (by both genders) I'm at a point where I want to have a nice time when I hang out with someone, I don't want them to dump their traumas and insecurities on me anymore. If it's a matter of opening up and getting closer to your partner that's great! It can't be every time you see them though. 

One thing I've noticed with men is they keep everything inside until they identify a safe person to talk to about it then they'll go overboard with that person and completely overwhelm them and when that person says something the guy will flip out about how men are supposed to be stoic and how unfair it is. When the reality is it's too much for a person to handle even if it was from a woman. Women tend to have multiple people they can talk to and they're fine getting a therapist if they need to, so they aren't overwhelming one person. Although I've been overwhelmed by women as well, the ones who dump on people frequently tend to drive people away and are left with so few supports they end up dumping away on what's left and can't build things back up again because it's continually driving people away. 

Emotions and insecurity are normal, it's good to talk. However. There has to be balance. :)"
rel_29176602,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,427,"Rev, your W's abusive behaviors cannot be excused -- but perhaps can be explained, especially if you would speak to a psychologist in your city. They may be due to her having very weak control over her own emotions (i.e., a lack of emotional skills she had no chance to learn in childhood). My exW has that problem. If it is an issue for your W, you likely would be seeing 4 other red flags.  
  
**The first** is a strong abandonment fear. I therefore ask whether, a few months into your relationship, she started showing strong jealousy over harmless events involving other women -- or tried to isolate you away from your close friends and family members? She would view your spending time with friends/family as your choosing THEM over HER. Moreover, she usually would hate being alone by herself.  
  
**Second**, you would be seeing her rely heavily on black-white thinking, wherein she categorizes everyone as ""all good"" (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me"") and will recategorize someone -- in just a few seconds -- from one polar extreme to the other based on a minor infraction.  
  
Because she also uses B-W thinking in judging HERSELF, she would rarely acknowledge making a mistake or having a flaw. Doing so would imply, in her mind, she is ""all bad."" She thus would blame nearly all misfortunes/mistakes on you and view herself as ""The Victim.""  
  
Further, to ""validate"" her victim status, she would keep a detailed mental list of every infraction/mistake you ever did (real or imagined) and would not hesitate to pull out the entire list to defend herself in the most insignificant disagreement with you. Moreover, this B-W thinking also would be evident in her frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions like ""you ALWAYS..."" and ""you NEVER....""  
  
**Third**, you generally would not see her directing her anger at casual friends, coworkers, or total strangers. She usually gets along fine with them. Rather, her outbursts and temper tantrums almost exclusively would be directed against a close loved one (i.e., against YOU or her parents).  
  
**Fourth**, you are convinced that she truly loves you. But you often would see her flipping, on a dime, between Jekyll (loving you) and Hyde (devaluing or hating you) -- often making you feel like you're walking on eggshells. Such flips would occur in a few seconds in response to some minor thing you say or do. A few hours or days later, she can flip back just as quickly. Rev, have you been seeing strong occurrences of all 4 of these red flags?"

If you want to change that, it seems like you have to address the root of the NC. That may be something this is too painful for you to consider, as it could lead to a revelation that you are, indeed, at least partially responsible for his death. That seems like something no parent would want to confront/admit. But short of tackling the root cause head on, I’m not sure how you can repair the rift.

rel_32057920,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,295,"So he thinks that there are multiple people out there he'd rather be married to, but he married you. 

Do you know what that means?  It means that you'd be happier without him.  It means that he lied when he married you - but it also means you believe that lie enough to keep ignoring when he's telling you the truth.

Single women are typically happier than their married counterparts.   Google it.  A guy has to be your BEST friend, you have to be his, in order to make the risk of marriage worth it.  I've been in relationships that I would've pushed through to marriage because I wanted that kind of love so bad, and it wasn't until I met my husband that I realized how hard I was pushing- and shouldn't have to push - to feel like it was a good relationship. 

Yes, marriage is hard.  But it also is supposed to make things that seem impossible achievable, it is also supposed to make you incredibly happy and loved enough to power through the hard.

Keep a journal and document how many times you interact with him and he makes you feel bad, and document when you feel ""happy,"" is it because he understands you,  or because you are pushing hard to try and be happy.

If you are pushing yourself to make happiness, and it's not coming from him, just imagine how happy you could be without the dead weight of someone who is bitter about their life choices.

There is always at least one person out there who can make you happy, and that's you.  You can find other people - even if it's not a romantic partner - who are happy they get to live life with you, too."

My advice is maybe he's dimwitted and doesn't understand what he's doing so you could try talking, but if he pushes you away.... if he kicks dirt on the fire you're single handedly maintaining... What can you do.

You're not the only one going through something like this. I got ghosted after something bad happened in my ex's life and the next reply was she fell for someone else because he can actually be there with her. The day before she said she loved me and called me her future husband. 

Kind of cold hearted, but not unexpected especially seeing as she put out more red flags than china, and it did hurt... but i understand, distance is hard, and there are needs others can fulfil. If you care about someone you let them do what they think is best, even if it's without you. 

All that said, communication is one thing couples absolutely need. Some people are stronger than others, more standup, more committed through thick and thin. If you got friends talk to them, it's nice to have comfort if it's available so it isn't all on you."
rel_34124084,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,321,"Here's the way I conceptualize it. 

A toy is a toy, but when used by someone that you have an emotional, physical, sexual, deeper connection too, it transforms that toy into a sexual tool to enhance the experience (and in a way i think it becomes an extension of your partner - them putting their sexual energy into the toy). Let me give an example. 

I have a vibrator. My vibrator can sit in my drawer, or I can use it on myself with masturbation. One time, my fiance grabbed my vibrator to use it on me. I was so hyped and excited that he was the one using it on me, that I literally orgasmed before the toy even hit my body. My body anticipated the use of the toy WITH my fiance so much, that I came from it. 

A toy shouldnt make you feel inferior and/or unworthy. If anything, I hope it would empower you and bring you and your partner closer together for sexier deeper connective sex. I would any day of the week prefer my partner to use my toy on me then use it on myself. As a society, we have this idea that If we use toys that we are awful at pleasing our partners or are unable to please them ""naturally"". To me, that's bullshit. I feel closer and more connected with my partner when I am feeling him please me, whether that be his hand, mouth, or a toy. Toys shouldn't scare us away. 

Also, toys can be for BOTH men and women. It's more stigmatized for men to want toys used on themselves, but if anything it makes the sex better by enhancing pleasure. I understand how you may be feeling the way you are right now, but I hope that this is something you guys could try and something that can be accepted into the relationship. You got this :)"

Oh darn, how dare you listen to what she communicated last time AND be conscious of her cramps/pain.

The serious input is that this girl gets off on the power trip of ignoring you and turning that down. She’s 26, your 30. Stop playing these stupid games.

So I told him that and he hated me. Now he thanks me and I make fun of him.

I hope this helps"

Cops who can easily investigate a matter, do it daily on different crimes, and you can't work out that de-escalation of a hostile scenario isn't doing anything? To investigate, at least on a more baser level, is not doing anything? To check for injuries on said possible beatings on BOTH suspects isn't doing anything? You're not only vile, lazy, and cruel, you're lacking in any level of human empathy or understanding.

It's easy in this situation to become resentful, on both sides. If he's joking/talking about hurting himself, though, then maybe you can look into some help for him - helplines, the anonymous text-based chat services maybe, counselling (whatever resources you have in your area). A lot of insecurity in relationships seems to come from people thinking that they have nothing outside of that relationship. What does he have, that you can help him see/build on, outside of this relationship that can help give him some purpose, maybe? "

She got a lot better after she was in college for a couple of years and matured. We actually ended up living together for a year after she graduated. I think that girls can be nasty sometimes and she probably needs a couple years to mature. I would continue to just be as nice as possible to her, and remember that she’s just immature. That way she doesn’t build more negativity towards you and has no examples of you being a dick to her to cite later. Best of luck!"

After figuring that out, make a list of them. The ones that over lap are top priority. The ones that aren't g9 further down. Make an effort to fulfill as many as possible.

Secondly, if you're interested in kink, take the bdsm test, (ideally together, you'll learn more about each other) 

Thirdly, communicate. You're not going to get anywhere if you don't say anything.

rel_16565160,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,239,"Now hold on a second. Do you actually think this is about a slideshow? That Monica is upset that she wasn't in a fancy picture reel?

That's not what this is about. 

This is about how someone hated Monica so much that they decided to cut her out as if she never existed. This is about how someone intentionally excluded her and NO ONE ELSE in a slideshow at her grandmother's funeral. This is about how someone sounded a huge dog whistle that Monica wasn't welcome in the family. This is about how after all of that, everyone is telling her to move on and not even letting her express the anger and frustration that comes from being excluded like this.

 That's what this is about. Obviously you can't turn back then clock and include her, that's ridiculous. What you CAN do is listen, let her know that she isn't crazy for feeling upset, and call out whoever made or influenced the slideshow. I'm still not clear on who made it, but it seems obvious Lucy had a big hand in either picking all the photos or removing ones of Monica.

 My advice to you is to stop ignoring the real problem here.

 Best case scenario: your family thinks so little of Monica that they forgot to include her.

 Worst case scenario: someone actively targeted Monica as a not-so-subtle way of telling her that isn't welcome in the family."

There’s a massive difference between enabling and supporting someone who has decided to make steps to change

Its very likely the only thing that will jolt her into taking an honest look at her life is her relationship status drastically changing
She has to truly decide to change first before she can expect support, not enablers, on her new path

If you love and respect the best part of her (at this point, the best part of her is maybe her potential, so if you love and respect her potential), then make the hardest but best decision for the two of you (the best parts of the two of you) and do what needs to be done

rel_35032273,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,151,"It's the complete lack of care for another living being. You're all that cat has and knows. It's not going to understand why it's been dropped off at a shelter, just that it's in some unfamiliar place. 

You and your girlfriend are downright stupid for thinking that this cat would act any differently than it is. It doesnt even sound like bad cat at all. Oh but we didnt know we weren't cat people guys it's not our fault. Fuck off with that 😂 you just didnt think it through properly and now she wants to get rid of it for literally just being a cat.

rel_30404326,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,598,"Ok, the first thing that immediately jumps out to me is that both of you don't have good communication skills. At all. And that's slowly but surely taking a toll at your relationship.  


You, for example, are hugely dissatisfied with your sex life. And your response is to...read love stories, listen to tales of your friends' orgasms and faking noises in bed. Did you, for once, sit him down and straight up told him how you feel? And I don't mean ""Maaaybe we could try some new position once in a while"" but straightforward ""I've never had an orgasm with you and it's making me sexually miserable"". Does he even know how unhappy you are (with regards to that aspect of your relationship)? Or have you never told him and then wondered why isn't he doing anything?  


Second example would be your ultimatums to leave which you're not following through. Look, threatening to leave your partner is a serious business. You never do it lightly, but when you do it - you mean it. By this point, he's probably realized that your threats are toothless and he can just behave the way he wants anyway. As for marriage - it's obvious that you want it; but it's equally obvious that he doesn't. Or that he's extremely indecisive or that he doesn't know what he wants; neither of which is good. After such a long relationship you should have realized that.  


You boyfriend, on the other hand, isn't winning any ""Communicator or the year"" award any time soon, either. It seems that his go-to response to problems he doesn't want to face is to smile, nod and then do nothing. Seriously, if that's how a grown man goes through life, it's not a good sign. And forgetting you on a Valentine's day is just off-putting.  


The two of you have been together for 10 years. You've built you entire lives around one another. You know each other's virtues and flaws, nooks and crannies, desires and needs completely. And judging by your desire to get married; you (hopefully both of you) are looking to spend the rest of your lives together. And even with all of that in mind, you both seem terrified and at the very least uncomfortable to discuss issues that have been bothering your relationship. You're both content to let these issues grow and fester because too afraid to have a serious discussion with someone you love and care about. Problem is, these issues won't go away by ignoring them.  


I'm not going to tell you to work on your relationship, or to attend couples counseling or to dump him or any of the usual shtick this subreddit is full of. Whatever of these if correct, if any, is for you to figure out. What I am going to tell you is to work on yourself and your communication skills. For example, you obviously desire for more passion, romance and intimacy, both in and outside of bedroom. So show it. Express it. Have a healthy discussion with your boyfriend about it and don't let him go into his usual ""smile and promise; and then ignore afterwards"" routine. State you wishes and face your relationship issues in a straightforward manner. By all means, be polite, constructive and considerate of his feelings while doing so - but do it regardless. Otherwise this lack of communication is going to hurt you for the rest of your life, until hopefully you've had enough and fix it. Well, don't wait for that moment - fix it now.  


Good luck in any case."

rel_16423447,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,323,"You should *probably* just drop it and move on, though there's all kinds of asexuality and it could potentially be okay if you are both open and honest about your needs and how to address them. If she's sex-repulsed, that's going to likely be a problem, where a gray asexual might not mind sex as a bonding activity but not really be super into the sex itself - I'm guessing from the way you're putting this that it's the former case. If the interest in a relationship seems mutual, you need to have an open and honest conversation about what each of your needs in a relationship are, and be ready to let it go and move on if those turn out to be completely incompatible. From the way you describe it I suspect that would be the outcome, but people can surprise you sometimes. The important thing is to approach the conversation without judgement and with honesty, and be ready to accept that you might be better off as just good friends than as romantic partners.

In either case, it's okay to have desires and urges, that's completely natural - she's a person you're clearly attracted to, after all, and it doesn't make you a monster to *want* to have sex with her, people are sexually attracted to people that don't want to or can't engage in sex with them all the time, and you can't just decide to not have the desire. What is important is what you do with those desires, if you make them her problem or try to push it when she doesn't return the interest, yeah that is a shitty thing to do, but there's nothing wrong about the desire itself. Have all the private fantasies you want, enjoy them during times of personal self-reflection, whatever - just understand that moving those fantasies into reality, even just in discussion, is going to require consent on her part."

That's just part of a relationship evolving. 

That said, the things you're discovering sound to me like pretty major incompatibility issues. If trying to get her to do things you enjoy is like pulling teeth, it's time to have a serious conversation. Sit down and explain what you're feeling (probably skip the downtown apartment fantasy lol) and ask about how **we** can work through this.

I trust that he will make the effort, but we will see on our upcoming trip. and when I explained how I value having dinner together, he has made a point to have dinner together every night since. and we discussed the cleanliness of the house, he has started doing the dishes nearly every day while I do other chores, but he still only really has the stamina to do 30 minutes to maybe an hour of cleaning, so the place never quite gets clean. it is getting better though...the video games though are where he doesn't seem to understand my needs. I talked to him about the importance of coming to bed with me most nights, and he does, but he sits up playing games on his iPad. I really value that particular time together and he doesn't so much. every time we are in the car, even if its down the street to the grocery store, he brings his iPad and plays games. sometimes I feel more alone when I am with him than I do when I am alone because of this.

No, it's not normal that a husband sneaks away to spend time with another woman and her family. 

No, it's not normal that you only met this supposedly close friend only once and it ended with her evaluating you and finding you lacking. 

No, it's not normal that your husband doesn't stand up for you and treats you badly. 

No, it's not normal that he is a “historically bad communicator” as you put it so nicely when he's in fact simply nothing but keeping information from you.

But with the shady address thing I think he's up to something illegal and she's in it with him. And when he sneaks put to go over they're working on whatever shady stuff they're up to.

rel_19354720,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,402,"This is a great response, and you pose a lot of good questions. I don't think marriage is primarily ""about"" kids for him, so much as he is trying to control the factor of feeling pressured to have kids once we do get married. We've also discussed various possibilities, such as what we would want if we couldn't have biological children, and even thought marriage and a family are a future we want together, kids aren't the primary reason either of us want to get married. Where we do differ slightly is that I view marriage as more of a gesture of commitment than he does, in fact gestures of commitment in general and even words of affirmation are important to me. In his eyes, being with me IS the gesture of commitment lol. And by extension, when we get married isn't a big deal because we are committed to each other so we both know we'll get to it. This is something we've had to communicate about and understand each other better, he's great about working to meet my needs and I'm better about just telling him exactly what I'm wanting without having certain expectations and being upset when he doesn't even know what's on my mind. Marriage is just not something I was ever exactly in a rush to get to, we were on the same page in terms of being cool with knowing we both wanted that. However, some of the questions you asked are the same ones that are kinda throwing me. Namely that I went from not in a rush but also thinking it will happen sooner than later to wondering if this salary thing could potentially be an indefinite wait. Tbf in his industry it's entirely possible to make that much in a year, but anything can happen. I guess I just would have preferred to have already known this rather than thinking the time was likely approaching and what I was waiting on was him getting to propose the way he desired. EDIT: wanted to add that we've also discussed things like me staying home after the first year and childcare arrangements/expenses. I'm an elementary school teacher so the likelihood of me making all that much money is low, though it's much more realistic with his profession. I know he does feel the pressure to make the money that will keep a future family stable."

I understand the difficulty seeing a SO have the kind of family you've always wanted, and that at special events the feeling of loss and exclusion can be exacerbated and that you especially don't want to feel that on YOUR day...but the thing that a lot of brides forget is that it's the groom's day too, and that the whole point of getting married is that you are joining your lives and families together. You will have family at your wedding, what's his is yours and what's yours is his, and they are your family. You may not see it as a rejection, but believe me it will be one. You will be making sure that you always feel like an outsider or excluded from his family the longer you keep from embracing the idea of NEEDING them at your special events. You are gaining so much more than just a husband when you get married, find comfort and joy there. Ask his dad to walk you down the isle or something to that affect, I'm sure it would mean so much to all parties involved. The longer you hold onto the identity of being abused or abandoned, the longer you will feel it. Adversity doesn't define us, what we do when faced with adversity is the true measure of who we are."

Your fiance went the opposite route, tried to downplay everything and make it seem like she was being taken advantage of, and yeah I could see it with the age gap there being a bit of a power dynamic, you said her parents were incredibly strict so I could see that playing a part too, but she was absolutely dead set on ruining your SIL and your nieces life so she could keep taking your brother's smelly dick. 

At first I thought maybe they didn't know that you were related, but you mentioned that they've seen each other multiple times, so they've actively hid this from you, I would imagine they've had at least one, probably a lot more conversations about how to keep this from you. 

At the end of the day, what's fucked up isn't that she banged your brother years before you met her, it's the active deceit throughout your entire relationship, I understand the argument of it was before you met, hell I even understand the argument of trying to keep it from you because she loved you and that would have sucked to hear. 

All in all, you've had your world rocked, what you need to do right now is focus on yourself, take a couple of days to just accept and experience the emotions you're going through and then decide what will make you happy.

Please tell me you’re not a massive idiot, because if you’re considering buying any real estate with her, DONT. Seriously, don’t. I wouldn’t recommend it with someone you’re not married to who ISNT throwing up all these greedy red flags, but if you buy an apartment with someone like her, fully expect to lose a good chunk of the equity you’re paying for, as she’ll try to get all of it if you split. Never buy property without very clear paperwork from a VERY good attorney that very clearly lays out who puts in what, and who gets what in the case of a break up, in a good market, a bad market, etc. and also handles repairs, renovations etc.  this is a ton of work to do right though, so just don’t bother and DO NOT BUY WITH SOMEONE YOURE NOT MARRIED TO."
rel_20586097,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,248,"Tell her you think it could be because of something intimate the two of you did together, and you're concerned that you inadvertently did something that negatively affected the health of her vagina. Tell her you feel guilty that you could have accidentally given her an infection and don't want any harm to befall on her because of your actions. This will make it seem like her smell is an unintended consequence of your actions, and therefore not her fault. For reference:

1. If you ever cum inside her, the semen can throw off the pH of the vagina, leading to issues.
2. If your fingers or dick ever had some bacteria on them when you penetrated her with them, it could have lead to an infection. I'm not calling you dirty here btw, it's just totally possible since sex can happen spontaneously and in situations where people aren't 100% clean. 
3. If you accidentally drag bacteria from her anus to her vagina, it can give her an infection.  

At least this may convince her to go to a doctor who can then determine if the smell is coming from downstairs or not and what she should do...

Alternatively, if you have a close relationship with her mom/sister/friend/coworker who she regularly visits IRL, maybe ask them to gently let her know she smells without telling her you told them to let her know? Yes it's going behind her back but I think in this case it is justified."

It's great that she told you this now, because trust me it will save you from so much heartbreak in the future when you find out that she fulfilled her goal without you.

The honest truth is this brother, if this is not something you want in your relationship with her you must tell her ""HELL NO"" to that idea of having a threesome period. Because, the very minute you agree to fulfilling her desire of doing this you will undoubtedly open pandora box. I don't want to say it, but with or without she's going to go through with and there's pretty much nothing you can say or do about it, because it's a burning desire in her to do it. And when that opportunity comes knocking and it is within her reach, she will go through with it with or without. 

If this is absolutely something you don't want in a relationship tell her that and make it explicitly clear of that, and if she can't accept that you have to move on to someone that shares your values. I'm warning you, don't open that box of a threesome because it will start off great and end miserable for one of you two, but more likely you because this was not your idea from the start, but hers."

Non-monetary contributions can be massive, especially from the women. Managing the household, child bearing and raising, cooking, cleaning. Even when jobs like cleaning are hired out, it is usually the woman who has to find the housekeeper and make sure things get done.

Your bf has shown you that he has already determined that YOUR non-monetary contributions are worth ZERO to him. 

ZERO. 

Every night when you clean up after dinner while he goes back to his home office to finish up some work, YOU are doing unpaid labor while HE is advancing his career. He will continue to outpace you in earnings but NONE of the work you do to help free up his time will count. Dry cleaning pick up? Zero. Hosting events for his clients? Zero. Scheduling his doctor’s appointments? Zero. Sending holiday cards to his family, friends and business associates? Zero. Doing his laundry? Zero. Shopping for his clothes? Also zero. 

The time you take off for maternity leave? Worth ZERO. 

Every time you attend a child’s school conference? He’s telling you up front how much value he places on that activity to care for the child: ZERO 

If you give up any compensated working time to do normal things like birth and raise children, your lifetime earnings will decrease substantially. What did he just tell you that was worth to him? ZERO.

I have found these ""red flags"" AKA ""hints"" mean a woman wants out:

- Gains a *significant* amount of weight, complains, but does nothing about it.

- Starts/engages in fights frequently

- Loses her desire for sex

- Depressed or doesn't want to do things any more

- Won't talk to you about what is going on

Withholding sex should be the #1 way to get a guy to dump a woman, as all men want and need sex.  

You tried to dump her, and she ""got so sad"" that you could not do it.  Of course she got sad, but it's a TEST to see if you were firm in your decision.  You were not, so you have failed the TEST (I call it the Man Test) so she is not happy with you.  If you had dumped her, you would have passed the test.  Conversely, this would have been a GOOD thing and she would be MORE attracted to you.  The drawback is that you've dumped her, and if you take her back then you fail the test.  It's a catch 22 at this point.

Now she is sleeping on the couch downstairs.  I would say this is a VERY big hint that you need to break it off.  She is unwilling to work on the relationship, have sex, or other things.  She may be a great person, but she's not SO caring about you to do anything to make it work.  That's a BIG red flag in my experience (not opinion, experience, this has happened many times in my past until I figured it out.)

I am going to suggest you think about what she is doing and not doing, and what would happen if you were to do the same things in return to her.  Would a normal happy woman allow you to treat her like that?  Probably not, she'd probably dump you.  I suggest you do the same ...

Best of luck.

P.S.  The advice which is ""rude"" is more ""male"" and ""honest"".  If it's hurting your feelings or upsetting you, then you should pay attention.  Life lessons are rarely painless and easy.  These guys are speaking the cold, hard truth, and while they may not be written from the perspective to kiss your ass, you're an ADULT and they are assuming you will understand that it is not personal and you need a kick in the right direction.  :D"
rel_17369159,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,137,"Your MIL is a gold digger and she raised a woman who only cares about money. She *cheated* because she was afraid she’d “never be anything more than middle class.” AKA you, and the life you’ve made, isn’t good enough for her. I agree with others’ speculation that MIL was implying your wife should leave you for someone richer who could offer more ‘opportunity.’ 

Your wife isn’t insecure, she’s vain. She thinks of no one but herself and how she can get ahead. For her to claim that she didn’t disrespect you because she didn’t talk shit about you in professional emails just shows how out of touch with reality she is. 

Divorce her. Show the court that how you were instrumental in building this business by supporting her, and take a good chunk of her money/business."

A full time job sucks. Its hard, its tiring and when you work all day, you feel drained and want to recharge. 

Recharge means shutting your brain off and not talking to anyone.

That doesn't mean he doesn't want you or love you. It means he needs space so he can do something he enjoys in the few hours he has before he has to go right back to work.

Sure, you want him to enjoy talking to you more too.
But ask yourself this.
Do you fight every time you talk? How often do you cause him stress? 
You're his girlfriend. You're supposed to be his release from stress. You're supposed to be his partner.

Apologize. You put up a fuss, got overly angry in a stupid argument and told him to never talk to you again in a immature and petty way.
Hes doing exactly what you asked.

Unless you admit to him that you were being petty and immature, and actually have an adult conversation without fighting or whining or putting up a fuss (meaning let him talk about his feelings without cutting him off or getting upset), youre probably going to break up.

rel_3036165,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,269,"I can't say I've exactly been in your position, but here's what I can offer:

1) You are still young

At 26, you have PLENTY of your best years ahead so do not feel at all pressed for time. While I was single at around your age, I too felt hard-pressed to find love. I was under the impression that I only had 5 years to find love for some reason. Some of the best relationships I know started in their late 20s or early 30s.

2) Stay vigilante in what you want.

Understand that there is nothing wrong with being picky about who you date. For those who seek a lifetime partner, you reserve the right to pick someone who is going to reach the attraction levels you desire- especially given that you are wanting to spend your remaining days with them. With that said, make sure your expectations are legitimate. The higher your standards are, the longer it will take to find that special someone. This is not to say don't completely lower your standards, but have a compromising balance. 

3) Love yourself

Take it as you read- LOVE YOURSELF. If you stay active on the hunt, you will eventually come across the right person for you. In the meanwhile, LOVE YOURSELF. Take care of your body physically, emotionally, and mentally. Do things you really enjoy doing and things you want to experience. Doing these specific activities will help you develop not only self-appreciation, but self-confidence as well, which goes a long way in the dating world. 

If you wish, feel free to message me as well."

‘ Marital rape is considered a form of domestic violence and has been illegal since 1992’

That’s in the UK. Several other western countries had similar legal norms until around the same time period. And multiple societies TODAY have the same norms. And, coincidentally or not, porn is illegal or severely frowned upon in all of those societies (muslim and african mostly). But sure, i’m batshit crazy. 

I never said porn saved women from domestic abuse. I meant that your wildly outdated ways coincide with the same time period during which OTHER wildly outdated ways were considered the norm. People thought porn was evil in the same time period when people thought it’s okay to rape your spouse. 

Yes, obviously some women can climax in under 5 minutes. But is that really the amount of time the average woman would prefer their sex to last? Foreplay included or not... my partner prefere 20-25 minutes and i have no idea whether my masturbation habits have caused me to last longer. I strongly doubt it, since despite these habits, my main struggle, as is the struggle of every man i know, is to NOT cum, not to cum. If porn would cause me to last longer, i would certainly welcome that. 

Men who overuse porn and masturbation can indeed develop ED and other issues. Doesn’t sound like OP’s bf has or is developing any of those issues, nor does it sound like he is masturbating excessively. Studies quantify excessively as more than once a day. I’m certainly against porn addiction and people addicted to porn should have access to proper treatment. 

And cereal is an evil industry because nestle and the likes pray on african tribes, countries and people for cheap labor and steals their direly needed water supplies. I do hope you’ve never had cereal, otherwise you’re a horrible person who supports an industry preying on impoverished men and women. 

I wonder, if i only watched porn made by wealthy and willing porn actors, would that make my habits acceptable in your book?

You don't even know what work OP's husband does. Not all jobs are that demanding. You're just assuming what he does is harder.

Personally, every father I know can't spend more than an hour alone with their kids before nearly having a mental breakdown. They prefer to have a full time job over doing childcare. That says a lot. 

Childcare is a lot of work, even with just one. Especially since she's breastfeeding. You've likely never been the primary caretaker of a newborn/toddler since you minimize the amount it can actually exhaust a person.

Spending time with family isn't work, but being the primary caretaker of a toddler is a lot – there's no breaks unless your kid is good with frequent naps. You're attempting to belittle the work she does while assuming what he does is harder, based on absolutely nothing. 

&gt;He just wants to receive back the affection he’s putting out.

What affection? OP never mentioned him doing anything romantic or affectionate whatsoever. He works, that's what a parent does – both of them work and do important jobs.

I sincerely hope you don't have children, unless you take on the primary childcare role. If not, your poor wife..

OP doesn't owe him sex. They have a healthy sex life, she said they've had sex 3 time this week. He's just excessive. Above all, there's no valid reason to be rude &amp; intentionally make your partner feel bad about not being in the mood for sex, even if it's been over a week+

Do you believe that you can remain friends with her without a) Being cold and distant to her, or b) Resenting her for rejecting you, and possibly dating other guys?

If you believe that you're able to manage these pitfalls, then what you suggested is a good way to move on. Closure is important. At this moment, she has no way of knowing what you're thinking. She doesn't know if ignoring you on this topic will allow you to get past it, or if you'll continue to romantically pursue her quietly. And that is easily a friendship killer. So, whichever path you decide to go, you owe her the courtesy of being transparent and cluing her in on your decision.

Note that for some people, they can only get over a friend they have feelings for if they have distance from them. But that does come at a cost, as it often hurts the friendship permanently. But even then, it's far more preferable to being ""stuck"" in your feelings for someone who can't or won't return those feelings. 

Others are able to deal with their own feelings while remaining friends with that person, without causing them grief over it. This is better for the friendship, but considerably more difficult.

3. He clearly has major self control issues.
4. Also self destructive. Depression and mental illnesses can be hellish to deal with, but if you don't try to work through things to a degree they're even worse not only for you but any potential person you might get into a relationship with.

In summary he's a lying, cheating drunk with self destructive tendencies and impulse control issues as well an unhealthy mindset.

People who do shitty things are also capable of doing nice things, I'm sure the ex he cheated on thought he was really sweet too afterall.

There's a saying over in r/rpghorrorstories which is ""better no D&amp;D than bad D&amp;D"" (and also the reverse) and I think it adapts pretty well here to ""Better no friends than bad friends"".

1) Call one of your good friends or family. Near or far, I'm sure they'd love to hear from you and commiserate about the shit your ex pulled. But lets take care of the immediate.

[https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/)

3) Pull out a copy of the lease.   Somewhere in there are early cancellation provisions.  Usually something of up to 2 months rent penalty with 30 days prior notice.  So while an expensive hit, you could put that on a credit card and limit the financial bleeding.  Maybe one of your friends could help you out with some of the $ to float you moving/airfare costs.

4) Are you in a space too big for you? Is there a possibility of relocating in the same building to something smaller that you can afford?  Some places will waive any penalty if you just switch within the building.

5) Craisglist is a big resource to find roommates.  You can create a post right now and start interviewing candidates.  you can also take a look at current listings and see if there are any more of a financial fit for you and someone with a good fit.  Either way can be an easy way to make a new friend.  I'm friends with a bunch of former roommates.

6) Unfortunately a lot of young service men have an experience like this relationship wise.  Why don't you give that  Veteran Crisis Hotline a call 1-800-273-8255 or text 838255 like u/Physion suggested?  Or you could mozey to the local VFW or some other waterhole with fellow military brothers?"

How this often plays out is that he will offer to support you, pay for trips, move you into his home, buy you things. Maybe encourage you to not work, or work only casual jobs so your schedule is flexible and you can do whatever at the drop of a hat. Which sounds great, right? So much fun! Until you realize that you've not built a career of your own, have no financial security of your own, and are stuck because you're dependent on him. Once you're dependent, he may begin to manipulate you into doing things you're uncomfortable with, or cheating, or treating you badly/being abusive, and you won't have the resources to get away. Even if he does none of those things and you just decide you want to break up, it will become clear very quickly that you don't have the money or work experience to stand on your own two feet. 

It's common in age gap relationships for the man to either dump the woman when she's out of her 20s, or when she starts to catch on to the manipulation tactics and begins to question his behavior. Then he'll gaslight her so she thinks she's the problem, and the abuse continues.

Physical appearance isnt everything and he chose you over someone who he couldve been more physically attracted to but perhaps wouldnt love since for him it sounds like its very important that he has a caring and a woman who makes a great mother, these are way better qualities than being physically attractive. Personality &gt; Physical appearance, always.

If I was you, I would tell him to stop speaking to others about this because definitely it isnt respectful and also he needs to clearly and truely tell you what he loves about you so you can feel the true love he has for you in order to move on from this."
rel_1137912,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,427,"I read your entire post and can relate in a few ways.  I'm going to try to provide a simple of explanation as possible....

Relationships can be very difficult when they begin during childhood/teenage years and move to adulthood.  Everyone has their fantasy of their ""dream"" person when young, but people change.  People change the most from their teenage years to adulthood.  Often, people hold on to the nostalgia of the past ""high school sweetheart"" mentality because at that time, relationships are not bound by ""real life"" challenges.  Those relationships are full of emotions and classic times.

I believe you and your husband are now two different people, that you have both now transformed into adults.  You two are struggling with the change and might not make it.

As teenagers and young adults, love is often defined by a feeling and bond you have with another human being.  It's a great feeling that one should embrace.  However, adults first respect their partner as another individual and out of respect show love to that person.  It doesn't sound like you two respect the other person for who they are as an individual.  Having respect and showing respect are two different things so please don't mix them up.

You touch upon many ""issues"" with your husband, but I think most of them are ""small"" in nature.  However, these small issues are exposing some fundamental flaws and themes you should be aware of....

1. Your husband sounds like he is using his friend as a buffer between you two.
2. All the little issues you touch upon show that there is a lack of fundamental respect for the other person as an individual.  Maybe more so on his part.
3. You two have grown up and your expectations of this married life were defined when you were younger and had it all planned out.  However, you two are now adults and the reality is very differert.
4. His confiding in another woman is not ok, but again, shows that the young man still may have sexual fantasies that young men have.  Sounds like he didn't get it out of his system.  

I don't think you two are bad people, nor do I think you sound that horrible to one another, but I do think you two have grown up and as a result, apart.  You need to forget about the past and either focus on your future together as two grown adults or move on peacefully.  Having a history together is not reason to stay together. 

What do you think?"

This also depends on how you do it would it be like 3 months visiting all of Europe or would it be 2 days somewhere every two weeks because if it’s the month one your making your relationship a ldr to travel. I’m also kinda in the same boat as your family because as far as I care solo travelling when your young is more for quick romances having one in each country you visit I don’t know I fined it hard to believe that you would visit France to see the Mona Lisa rather than hook up with some hot French dude. I’m not saying that you would cheat I’m saying that that is what I think of when I hear 20 something solo trip. I would also look up how to be safe and place where to avoid because you are a young female alone . What really matters is your bf opinion and your own

Tldr I think solo trips when your twenty are for sexing across the world not looking at the famous buildings and don’t if you meet 50 diffrent guys in ten different countries a “mistake” won’t happen. But in the end it’s your decision and if your bf trusts you"

My bf would always push me to go to the gym and make comments about how i was “a little fat” he himself is 300+ and i love him no matter what and never have said a word to him about needing to lose weight bc i know hes sensitive about it. though i try to push him to make healthy choices like eat better and go on walks so he doesnt have health problems. so some comments he made were etched into my mind forever. my ED came back into full force during the pandemic and now i’m down to 110 and hes disgusted by me, told me i was turning into a sack of bones during an argument about my phone slipping through my thighs. even at 160 i barely had tits or ass and now i guess its worse, it feels like he wanted me to lose weight but be curvy as well which is just not in my DNA i dont carry fat in my ass it goes straight to my stomach and face. and idk what to do im at a loss. i think we get compared to alot of women on social media and they dont understand that not everyone is set up that way. some people are blessed or get work done."

rel_935799,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,392,"I was going to give you a bunch of advice, but I think what you need  is guidance from people in long term relationships. 

Being into romance myself, I've asked older couples about love, and they typically say things ""you'll know if they're the one, you can feel it"". People who are still married have told me that.

Ask older couples (or anyone who is in a long term relationship) ""Hey, do you think you should feel ______ with your significant other? What if you dated for a long time but still don't feel attached and in love?"" get advice from them. Because I totally bet you that they will say you're not with the right person.

Granted, someone can be ""right"" for us fundamentally, as in, treat us well, love us, the whole shazam, but are they right for *you*? 

I think you aren't doing the relationship any justice by staying with her. It's not right to her. So I think you should ponder what you truly want out of a relationship, your feelings, and think ""if we were to stay together for much longer.. is that a happy thought? Am I excited? Would I regret not taking a chance and getting out there?""

Yes. From a ""moral"" point of view, you are going to look like an asshole or someone who doesn't know what they're doing. ""Oh, you've dated for so many years, you can't just leave her like that. If she treats you well, how can you go wrong with that?""

Do you see yourself being happy that you chose her as a future partner? Because I really think you're cheating both of yourselves if you don't. Relationships get stale, and with constant effort, there is a great chance it become lively and well again. But is this something you WANT to put effort in? 

Please take some time to think about this, talk to other people with more experience and are content with their relationships. Get more insight. Once you've come to a decision, I think you deserve to discuss this with her eventually, if you feel she isn't the right one for you. People can be beautiful creatures and love us, and we can love them. But it doesn't mean they are one of ""the ones"". 

In love is a thing. A great thing. It's out there. "

Ignoring all the filth and disrespect you spouted (and have continued to in your responses) and focusing on your second sentence it seems as though you should break off the engagement. If you weren't jumping to say yes then you aren't ready for that commitment. You don't ever have to be anyones, friend but common courtesy and respect is always welcomed and appreciated. Your opinions of her best friend and women in general it appears will seep through if they haven't already, which would almost certainly end the relationship/engagement anyways."

But I want her to really think about talking it out with her parents next year about her relationship with me. I want her to ask them to just hear out our feelings and emotions for each other.

inducing a miscarriage is even more cruel to the child than to get an abortion done, how could you even say that it’s a better solution? i was over 20 weeks pregnant when i found out, and by the time i managed to get a referral letter from a clinic to the hospital to schedule an appointment to access my eligibility for a labour induction abortion, it was too late. 

the post was made to reach out to the reddit community to get support for myself, of course i expanded on my thoughts and feelings. you completely missed the whole point, and now you’re trying to say that i’m being selfish? don’t even try to say that you’re thinking for the child bc you suggested self-induced miscarriage as an alternative solution.

you’re incredibly cruel and i hope this makes you reflect on what kind of person you are. i am not trying to suck sympathy out from anyone, nor did i expect to receive only love from making this post. you must have a lot of pent up anger and frustration from a different source to make you speak up like this and i’m sorry that you feel this way about my situation. but please do not say that i did not take my child’s well-being into consideration."

Honestly if I were you, I would treat them as misogynist as possible. I know if sounds horrible, but it worked on my sister and mom. My sister hates me for being born and used to always gives me an attitude. You just have to take your throne. When your sisters start talking and are being annoying say ""did I give you permission to speak? Women must be seen, not heard"" and when they get snippy, just reply ""Listen, I'm the man, and what I say goes. It's just his the world is. I'm sorry, but what I say is just objectively more important "". Make sure you laugh too. They'll be confused and take it better because they'll think you're kidding. You just need that kind of attitude. Make them realize how much power you actually have. When they need someone to open the jar or kill the bug, they'll go to you. Also, women generally love it when men treat them like trash. Not all, but a lot are subconsciously attracted to it. I'm going to get a lot of downvotes, but it worked for me, and it might work for you. Or you'll get kicked out lol. One or the other. Anyway, I'm sure if you start demanding some respect, you'll get it. At your point, I'm sure you give them respect and they don't give you any. Now it's time to switch it up. Demand they listen to you and when they try to speak, let them know that what they have to say isn't that important. Instead of being a weak beta male that worries about what your mom thinks of you, literally just act the opposite of how you feel and you'll get what you want.  You got this.

The rent issue though is more of a grey area. While I believe he should pay a third of it especially since you said he has no other home and he is full time living there. Your roomate might see it differently because he is sharing her room so she might not see the need for him pay.

Yes herpes is most contagious when someone has an outbreak BUT contact with an active outbreak is NOT the way herpes is most often transmitted. Genital HSV2 on average sheds asymptomatically, without symptoms to the host, on average 15-30% of the time. Herpes is transmitted up to 70% of the time asymptomatically. 

So you are right, people infected with herpes do not have outbreaks all the time but they do shed the virus at various times without the infected knowing."
rel_34316574,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,263,"Take a second to really listen to your gut about this. If he started washing his towel and stopped eating his boogers, would you still be having doubts? Because if that’s really the bulk of it , you should just kindly tell him that these things gross you out and make it hard for you to feel comfortable. 

If it’s more than that tho, maybe consider taking a break from the relationship to see if your emotional connection is really as special as you think it is. I’m not trying to be harsh, just speaking from experience as I was in a 2 year relationship where I felt the same way and it wasn’t until I met my current partner that I realized that what my ex and I had was honestly really never that special and the connection I thought we had was just what comes naturally when you spend so much time getting to know someone and could have been formed with literally anyone. 

The way I feel about my current partner (been together a year now) is so far beyond what I’ve ever felt before that my perspective on what “connection” looks and feels like has changed completely. It’s like I have this feeling deep in my gut that I’ve found “the one” and even if we don’t work out, at least I know what connection is supposed to feel like. My current partner and I have seen each other in some truly disgusting states (I’ll spare you the details) and it has never wavered our attraction the one another."

The whole thing is insane. 

But I wouldn't worry about having to take your kids out of their swanky school districts, because there is no way in hell you'll be able to leave with the kids unless he lets you.

The money disparity can really come back to fuck you with rich people, so you'd better be able to trust him if you have children.

rel_12400117,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,252,"I'll be honest here and admit that, I too, use to be ignorant towards my partner smoking weed. 

Maybe perhaps because I didn't smoke it and had no good experiences with the people smoking it... the only time I had been around people doing it was with friends, everytime they did it they would just sit there laughing at the most ridiculous things, one of them even changed colour before vomiting and falling asleep with their head halfway in the bowl, so I can't exactly say it left a good impression on me lol.

So when I entered into a relationship I felt like they ended up needing to be high to enjoy their time around me and to enjoy me in general, in a way it made me feel like a dull, unenjoyable person to be around but that was my own ignorance blocking what it actually did for him and that it had nothing to do with me at all lol

Overall I ended up getting over my ignorance towards it because it wasn't harmful and didn't change how he felt towards me.

Has she said why exactly she doesn't like you smoking weed? (Apart from the heroine friend) To give an ultimatum like that doesn't seem fair.. Although I feel you could have been open and honest about smoking it again before she found out on her own, that can't have been too thrilling for her and might be an extra reason for her to respond in such manner."

And breaking up over a thing like that line is better than trying to be manipulative or plot out traps.

rel_18528760,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,403,"He should be seeing a therapist more than once a month... sexual assault can do so much emotional damage, he needs more support. Weekly or bi weekly therapy may help him more. 

And so do you. You are also in this situation and while you didn’t experience the assault, it’s deeply effecting your life. Sudden loss of intimacy can trigger a lot of feelings. They deserved to be addressed. 

The sooner you talk with him about this, the better. But speak to a therapist first. Make a plan on how to approach this so everyone feels supported and heard. Some people are able to resume sexual intimacy after assault, some are not. Therapy doesn’t always help people move on. So him abstaining permanently could be an out come. And if that’s what makes him feel best... then that’s the right move for him. But you are also in this marriage. You have every right to say that sexual intimacy is a must for your marriage to work and for you to enjoy your life. You both are allowed to make the right choice for yourself even if it means the other is no longer included. 

Many people become incompatible over time for many different reasons. But fighting for your marriage so you know you did all you can to help him heal and make it work... that’s very important. Don’t give up yet. Individual therapy for you both and then couples therapy seems like the best move here. There’s a reason that vow is in there... for better or for worse. Well this right here, this is the ‘worse’ part. So hold on tight, give it all you can.

If he refuses to communicate with you or seek further help... it’s not your job to sacrifice your life/happiness for someone else who won’t seriously attempt to help themselves. Almost every couple faces times when sexual intimacy gets put on hold or stops. Cancer, injury, assault, mental illness, etc. But there’s a big difference between getting help and trying to resume life vs. refusing to even speak about it. What happened to him will change the rest of his life, some people need more help than others. Do your best to make sure he has ample opportunity to heal. 

I wish you both lots of love and luck. This is a tough road to walk. I hope it ends up happy for you both."

He said he wouldn’t be trying again which is the biggest point of the conversation. His approach he took it in was a bit harsh, but his feelings are hurt and despite our breakup there’s still love there between us. Despite our differences I still want him to be happy and I’ll always love him as he was the biggest person in my life for a long time, but I’ll always care for him. I just hope one day in the future we could rebuild a friendship and still have each other in our lives, but I know the chances of that actually happening are minimal.

He knows my ex hasn’t been taking the breakup well and has offered to step in if he ever crossed a line I wasn’t comfortable with. I just want to approach my conversation tonight by explaining my conversation I just had with my ex and that I shut it down for good. I don’t want to create any unnecessary anger or jealousy in my current boyfriend for someone he doesn’t need to worry about.

Shit happened during the summer and we stopped talking as much for a month before I cleared things up. And it wasn’t even until I got drunk one night in college that I confessed everything again and my friend texted her saying I wouldn’t stop talking about her all night.

Anyways, point being, just shoot for the stars, worry about the now. If two people are truly in love, it’ll work out. I know I’m still relatively young but I feel as if I will eventually end up marrying this girl, 9 years from now.

Goodluck, you got this"
rel_27374409,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,415,"You’re probably not going to like what I have to say but hear me out. You’re in the wrong here. It’s not appropriate to try and stop your boyfriend from going on vacation with his friends. Now, I could understand if they were going to Vegas for a bachelor party why you’d be a little uncomfortable, but it sounds like he just wants to go and spend quality time with his buddies...which he is entitled to do. 

By stopping him or making him feel uncomfortable or guilty about going, I promise you that you’re hurting your relationship. Not only will he feel “restrained”, but resentment is close to follow. You need to let him have experiences without you. It will strengthen your relationship bond and his feelings for you. 

The first trip is always hard. I remember the first time my partner went out of town like this, and I was sad to see him go. I thought that the two weeks he’d be gone, the house would feel empty and I would feel lonely. Well the house did feel empty...and I loved it! I didn’t feel lonely at all. We talked everyday and when we weren’t I was focusing on keeping myself happy and entertained. 

Here’s my advice. First, ascertain why it is that you don’t want him to go on vacation without you. Do you not trust him? Has he given you reason to believe that he’ll betray you or disrespect you while he’s gone? If so, this is what you guys really need to be discussing. 

If it turns out that you’re just nervous to be alone and without his company, which is normal, make sure you think of things that will keep you busy while he’s gone. Drink some wine or smoke a joint and start a new TV series. The time will fly. If that’s not your cup of tea, go out and reconnect with nature, spend time with friends, pamper yourself and have self care nights, every night, go out dancing with a girlfriend (depending on COVID restrictions in your area) or go get a coffee and window shop. Whatever floats your boat but make a plan and start to get excited for it. 

If you let your boyfriend go, and make sure he knows that you’re ok with it, his homecoming will be all the more sweet, and who knows? Maybe he’ll miss you tons and will want to bring you along on future trips. 

Good luck :)"
rel_35455478,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,461,"&gt;There have been many fights and many arguments about it.

So you've tried to work through this problem and communicate about it multiple times.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;He stopped playing on the weekends for a while, but then slowly starts up again - rinse and repeat.

Any time he has tried to improve, it never lasts.

It seems extremely clear to me that he is never going to change, just based on these two quotes alone. You've done your part - you've communicated, encouraged, supported, tried to help - and he hasn't done anything. So why are you still banging your head against the wall expecting a different result?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The other side of this coin however, is that over the last 2 years, he has become mean, cruel, nasty, rude, melancholic, angry and short.

So he doesn't ever want to spend time with you or his own child, and on top of that, he isn't a nice person to live with or be around. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We have a child, and I don't want to break up the family

This one is really stupid to me. What kind of family are you ""breaking up?"" Your child is living in an environment where their parents hate each other - that affects them. They are living with a man who doesn't even care about them, probably lets them down constantly, never shows them any love, and is as you say ""cruel, nasty, rude."" 

Kids are not as dumb as you think. Being raised in a toxic environment affects them a lot, in ways you wouldn't think of. It can make them underdeveloped in certain areas such as emotional maturity, emotional expression, etc. Because everything they see from their parents hating each other, they reflect in themselves as well. 

You are not doing your child any favors by ""not breaking up the family."" You are willingly keeping them in a toxic environment.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Our relationship gets no attention, he cracks the shits if I ask him to go do something as a family. 

He literally has shown you over and over again that he doesn't care about you, doesn't care about your child, etc. But you're going to believe him when he swears he loves you? You're going to forget his actions and stay with him just because he said some words anyone could say? Time to judge him for his actions - not his words.

So now that you know he won't change, it's up to you what to do with that information. You can stay with him, continue hurting yourself and your child, knowing it will never improve, or you can decide to leave, work on your self respect/esteem/worth, and raise your child in an environment that will nourish them instead of deplete them."

When I discovered I'd blocked him I cried so much knowing I might have missed my answer. I guess I'm hoping his reaction will tell me if he replied or not. If he says no, but he did reply to me, then I'll believe him. If he says no but didn't ever reply to that last message, then I wouldn't. If he said yes I think I would be ok. It's where all my friends jumped to anyway. In a way I would also feel like it justifies my thoughts on my deformity. It's exhausting having people constantly tell me it's not that bad, when it clearly is. I would see his ""yes"" as ""proof"" that it is impacting my chance of a romantic relationship, and I can start seriously looking into having some sort of surgery. 

I have had therapy and he was blunt and pointed out that is it not normal to have your first relationship aged nearly 30. Something is affecting it, and I need to know why, so I can fix it. I don't believe that there is someone out there for everyone. To counter to your point b, no one is owed a relationship. We have relationships with someone we want in our life. There is a reason why people don't want me romantically in their lives, and there's no point having more therapy if it's not my personality that's the problem. When I was with him I never questioned myself. I felt like if I could find it once then I could find it again, but hearing it was my looks has filled me with this awful insecurity, and I don't know how to get over it if I don't ask him. But I know it's an awful thing to do to him."

I'm sure she can tell - there are a million tells when someone isn't into it and of course that is upsetting.  It seems like she's checking to see if you want one and getting mad/upset/frustrated at the situation goes along with that. It feels shitty. 

But then you kind of got in a real world situation and panicked. So maybe not.

If trying date nights feels like a relationship then do more of those. More of those probably mean less fights. Try refocusing and actively looking for the good.

If you need to get yourself out of the hole and learn to communicate and get out of bad habits- both of you - then go talk to a marriage counselor for a short while. They can see/notice things we are too wrapped up to notice ourselves that can illuminate the issues - and sometimes translate. Find one you both like. 

What determines what happens next is your intention. you can break it by continuing to be negative, doing nothing aka helping the ship sink - or you can look for ways to improve, reconnect, and fix it. It's truly up to you."

Unusual or irregular periods? Doesn't mean you're infertile. Haven't gotten pregnant yet? REALLY doesn't mean you're infertile. Had your ovaries removed or made non-functional due to cancer or another condition? Infertile. Gone through infertility testing and they found blocked tubes, uterine issues, low egg reserve: dealing with infertility, but in some cases not impossible to get pregnant without assistance, just highly unlikely.

The fact that you’re open to possibly being the abuser in the relationship is very telling. It means that you have the ability to recognize the ways you have contributed negatively to a relationship. Don’t fall for the narcissist vs victim propaganda because honestly people are more complex than /r/NarcissisticAbuse would have you believe and they honestly throw the phrase around too freely (myself included)

Relationships aren’t always as binary as “one victim and one abuser”, both people can be unique victims of the unique abuse from their partners. Physical, mental, emotional etc. all of these types of abuse can be at play between two people. I recommend individual therapy."

Old house that needed a heap of bits n pieces redone. I understand totally at times I got frustrated at myself with how things were progressing and of course the amount of time everything took. Can't tell how many thousands of trips to and from the hardware store I made for stupid little things that really pissed me off, at time's I wasn't the happiest guy on the block either. 

Add pregnancy old dog &amp; projects all taking far too long our relationship suffered too. Dirty nappies and nail bags seemed like all there was too life.

At times it did all get too much, your stage now I'm assuming.  My wife planned a little getaway on our boat and within a few days of not having to be constantly busy I started to feel better and see things more clearly. 

I got back and got things done as to our talked out priority list. In no time I was ticking off the to do list and eventually got to the Dada be done day.

Few years down the road there are times I look back feet up at the projects and I can see through the walls if that makes sense to the mess it all was, then a little smile kicks in.

I know this is gonna come off as patronizing. I’m really trying not to be patronizing. But every bad relationship starts off like this. Every single time a man tells a girl she’s so mature, it’s just him trying to cover his tracks. Please look critically at this relationship. He can’t get a woman his own age (no 30 year old woman is going to agree to care for his aging mother for him). You’re reliant on him for housing, for money. You essentially owe him a lot. So there’s a power imbalance. If there wasn’t a power imbalance, you would just tell him “no I’m not caring for your mom.

I love you and we have two issues here:

1) behavior that is putting lives at risk (tying my boots)

2) how we treat each other. We have both failed to respect each other and that had gotten in the way of our happiness and others’ safety.

a) I failed by losing my cool. You were afraid of my anger, and I took responsibility for it. I want you to feel safe and happy, and one way I can help you do that is by not losing my temper as much as possible.

b) you failed by dismissing my concern for others’ lives and my job (even if not life-threatening, performing my job well and in a timely fashion is important.) You did not take responsibility for this. I want to feel safe and happy myself, and one way you can help me do that is supporting me by not making me lose precious time for emergency calls.

c) I failed by being petty and “teaching you a lesson.” I want to take responsibility and move forward. We both deserve to be safe and happy, and one way we can do that is by sharing and respecting our needs.

I basically have no friend beyond my housemates because I struggle a lot with being social, and currently I'm more worried about them not wanting to be my friends anymore.

If you can get your man to go to a gym with you then even better but if you can't you still have options.

Avoid fast food, processed food - meaning anything in a jar/can for the most part, anything with added sugar, all colas, and etc. Spend some time each day, even if it's 10 minutes, planning on what you're going to make for dinner. Find fresh ingredients and make dinner from a recipe rather than sit in front of a TV. This will soon become normalized and that's what we call a lifestyle change. Not a diet, not ""a plan"", but a change in the way you fundamentally live with food. My wife and I spend hours each week just centered on food stuffs and cooking together is a fun experience we do almost every night together. We go to farms and farmers markets together on weekends to get super healthy stuff instead of sitting around on computers and TV. Look around your area for local farms and markets where the good stuff's at. Find good sources of local produce that is real and organic (not purchased from Walmart and put on a display table). Have some fun with it, we have a ton of fun going to farms and stuff, so much so that it's become kind of a de-facto hobby for us.

When you say things like ""Don't listen to people who say porn and masturbation isn't wrong"" it sounds like you're saying that they are and OP's gf is implicitly in the right. When you say ""do her a favor and go"" it comes across as OP having done something wrong for not reading his gf's mind because she never brought up her feelings on the matter. When you say ""try and get on her level"" it sounds like you're saying he (and by extension ANYONE who does the same) is beneath her for occasionally enjoying porn and masturbation.  While you may not have intended it as such the comment reads as very judgmental and condemning, and OP even stated he'd be willing to give up porn for her.

I supported him whatever he wanted to do with his body. I decided if this is the look he likes, I can get used it. I did get used to it and found he looked just as good. Eventually he changed it up and grew his hair again.

If your fiancee wants to try something different with her hair, support her in it. Let her enjoy it. Looks are going to constantly change. What if she lost hair due to illness or something like that? Hopefully you would be supportive."
rel_28976659,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,101,"I understand that I can't expect her to be someone she isn't, but this isn't her. This time six months ago she had a regular well paying job with plans for future career growth and was even talking about going back to school and getting a second degree. Then the relationship issues occurred, then the job issues, then the money issues all snowballed within a couple of months. The cleaning is the same old Dani but everything else is new, which makes me think it's a mental health issue. I know I can't make her help herself but this isn't her."
rel_1831943,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,165,"In relation to what you want:

1. When did she say she would probably be available after next monday? did she tell you this recently? if so, how was the conversation.
2. Avoid this, you're asking to be rejected (unless if its closure you really want).
3. ~Play the game~ I don't suggest you doing this unless she flakes on your next get together. 

It sounds to me like she is probably in a tough spot in her life (perhaps talking to someone else or just rough times) and she needs some space for herself. If she really likes you and she has no reason to be with any other person but you, then she will talk to you. If she has lost interest then doing #3 will probably be your best answer. I would suggest you act on #1 before doing #3 though. We really don't know much about this girl besides that she *could* just be in a tough time in her life."

Good luck, girl. Turn up the porn, make some noises, get some toys. When he finally comes to investigate remind him he got up and walked away all mad. Shouldn't ruin your night."

Abandonment is not HIS issue.

You got time to research this online and do what it tells you to do.

You’re going to push this boy away. 
Do you want to push this boy away.

Then you must learn how to control your anxiety better. This is on you not him.

He’s not your daddy 

He’s not your superhero

What he wants out of the relationship is sanctuary and sex and fun and comfort. There’s enough craziness going on right now that he doesn’t need extra crazy

Who the hell am I and how do I know?

I was extra crazy, panicky, needy terrified of abandonment and guess what - I’m not anymore. 

And here’s why:

I pushed the boy away

I set up my own abandonment

And I suffer through it and I can live here. Faced my fear. There’s no medal ceremony

So you got your guy right there - research on the Internet about abandonment and anxiety and attachment styles and codependency 

Start understanding and modifying your behaviors 

you got plenty of time to practice now is the time - do not push the boy away!"

Shes going to need some time. Having 3 scary men in your home as a woman on your own is SCARY AS HELL, she probably wants distance from that. You may feel a bit numb to those kinds of feelings being deep in it for so long, but to someone not living that life, its scary, unknown and legally wrong.

You guys are not married and if so you cannot expect him to pay more just because has a higher salary and a fortunate amount of low expenses like rent and car insurance.

If you tell him he should pay more he'll rightfully get upset. You are young and have a career. Try improving yourself to get higher positions like a principal for ínstance. Or try to learn the stock market and/or crypto and try to invest the little you have.

Many people in my age use their money to party, go on vacations or buy the newest LV bag or whatever BS is now trendy. I saved up money over this summer while doing an internship and plan to invest in an ETF that I plan to use for my retirement, while also investing in cryptocurrencies and having money in general for harder times. And I am only 21 years old btw - those are things many people do in their 40s and it does not turn put so well for them.

Your BF made some very smart decisions, but also had some fortunate factors in it like his ridiculously cheap rent and parents cooking for him."

So you can maybe try and reach out and apologize but that decision while good for you is really hurtful. But also, you were respecting yourself and your emotions and needs and that’s okay too. It just comes down to the future now. I think we all can work on being more communicative about our feelings and problems. I know I have had these kind of moments but I’ve also had people do this to me and it is so confusing and sad to lose someone you really had by your side. 

And it sounds like he just wasn’t in a place to make the changes you did. That can be a hard thing for you because you clearly wanted to help him and support him and encourage him.

I think there was a lot to talk about with the relationship, definitely why he exploded his feelings on you. 

I’m sorry this all happen. It’s a tough situation. I know he blocked you but maybe finding a way to attempt an apology but also acknowledge how you were feeling? Or give your response to the things he said rather. 

If that all isn’t an option, you are going to have to learn from it and just move forward and come to terms with what happen.

rel_6237129,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,337,"Does he have toutettes?;I ask because I was diagnosed in grade school. I did not have the constant blurting of cusswords type, but more of the nervous tics kind. Head jerks, eye blinking, some soft vocal throat tics only I could hear ( I hope). I eventually grew out or learned to control the majority of all of it. Now as an adult, it 8s only when I'm really stressed out or anxious about something I blink my eyes more than I feel is normal. And I blink them harder than normal. (If that makes sense). To the point my eyelids feel fatigued. I normally am aware of myself doing it and although at times difficult to stop, I have been able to, once I calm down about whatever is bugging me, stop and blink normally. Often times my eyelids (normally only one or the other ) will twitch off and on like a muscle spasm for a while. Sometimes a long while, which can trigger the harder eye blinking. As to your question, I know this was oddly specific, but perhaps he is stressed and this is his bodies stress response. Maybe not.

Edit: After reading some other replies to this post. Pointing out the twitching (or other nervous habit, whatever it may be) or telling them they need help for it most often causes the twitching to intensify because it causes the person to be even more self conscious about it and stressing even more that they are do it. It takes time to control but the best thing (for me anyhow) is to just pretend like you dont notice it. It is hard at first and may take some time but one eventually learns to catch themselves and consciously unlearn the habit. It's like you have to make a habit of not doing the habit. Eventually I found that it stops very quickly without thinking too much on it.  It also helps to identify ones (bad) stressors and mitigate as much as one can."

I do not understand why you think we do not live together?

rel_27281889,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,261,"No, i dont think youre in the wrong. And i doubt that you'll ever meet her expectations. Whatever is going on with her, you'll never be able to fix it, either through changing yourself or pleasing her.

Some people are like this. Nice and sweet to others, probably you too, until you got married and she feels like she can treat you however she wants b/c you cant get away. Idk why shes like that. Itd take a therapist to figure that out.

It can get more complicated the longer youre together b/c your lives and finances become more intertwined. Like if you buy a house or a car, depending on the laws where you live, she'd be entitled to half. Even now you might have to pay alimony, etc. And if you guys have kids then it really gets complicated, and she'll be a part of your life for the next 20 years.

Do you feel like theres any relationship worth salvaging? Even if she was willing to try? But it doesnt sound like shes willing to work on things, she just wants you to meet her demands. And she'll always have more demands. Regardless of how you feel about her, it doesnt sound like she has much love for you. Get out now.

rel_9486411,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,288,"&gt;deleting chats, swearing on lives, accusing me of cheating.

See, I find this more of an issue than someone who drunkenly kisses (or even fucks) another person and then comes clean with their partner. 

When you get to the point of deleting messages and accusing your partner of cheating, you are making choice after choice to be a liar. 

That's a huge red flag. 

And the fact that it happened more than once means it's all pre-meditated. It's not something that just happened in a moment of vulnerability or stupidity. 

&gt;the blatant lying to my face

Honestly, this is really what makes cheating cheating. And I would think very hard about whether I wanted to legally tie myself to someone who makes an intentional choice and then lies to my face about it.

&gt;We've been together for so long I don't know if I could even be without him.

Yes, you can. To think otherwise is not healthy. It's codependent. You might not *like* to be without him, but you can definitely do it. 

You can sell the house and each take half of the money. You can share custody of pets. You should each have your own friends even if you have something of a shared friend group. 

&gt;He's also never done anything like this before

Maybe not, but he did it *multiple* times and then *lied* to your face about it. 

I'm not telling you to break up. 

But I think you need to postpone the wedding and do some hard thinking and communicating. 

Probably with a therapist.

&gt;He does genuinely seem sorry

Someone who is genuinely sorry for their actions does not try to pin the blame on their partner. 

He's sorry he got caught."
rel_15115305,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,533,"Well every Sunday my mom and I would wake around 8:30 and get ready and leave to make it to Sunday school by 10. Sunday school is broken up by grades, my church is rather small so a class on any given Sunday could be anywhere between 2-12 kids, just depending on who was there that Sunday and if they brought friends. 

My mom was my teen group leader. Teen group was a little bit different from the normal Sunday school. We didn’t join the rest of the kids in the “church” part of the church (where the sermons took place) where they would learn songs and play a little bit of bible quote trivia and have a small devotion/lesson and prayer. In teen group we learned about the “adult” things we were gonna face in life that would impact us and our Christian lives. My mom is a very good teacher and went so far as to include economic planning in her lessons. We all have open conversations about hardships in our life and we are allowed to bring honest questions to the group without judgement. While Sunday school is going on one of our pastors would be leading adult bible study in the dining hall where u get a more “historical” look of the Bible and the stories. 

People wear basically whatever they want. Most of the older people dress up a bit, suit and tie, dresses and hats, but my mom typically wore a blouse and jeans or a dress, just however she was feeling. I usually just wore a sweatshirt and jeans, sometimes I would dress up but I’m not one to wear uncomfortable clothes for no good reason, I genuinely do not think god gives a single shit what I wear, Adam and Eve were naked so my jeans shouldn’t be an issue. A lot of the young boys would wear athletic shorts and tennis shoes because we have a nice playground and lawn and a good supply of foot/soccer balls so they enjoy playing with their friends afterwards. 

The sermon is usually in 2 parts: the first is the law, pastor picks a lesson/commandment/teaching and talks about the sin and where it comes from, the second part the gospel, gods ever lasting love and mercy for us and redemption through his son Jesus. 

We have communion on the first and third Sunday of ever month and we practice closed communion so only members can partake but that is because we believe that partaking in the holy sacrament is a confession of faith so if u partake without actually believing it would be essentially a lie. 

Also we believe and encourage reading the Bible and other holy texts and literature, also the exploration of history and science. We believe that god created so many wonders in this world so that humans could explore and learn.

Wow sorry this turned into a wall of text, I’ll stop here. If u want to know anymore please pm me, I’ll give u a link to my church’s website and our Synod’s website so that if u like u can look for one in ur area just to see what it’s like."

Break up with her just do it I know it will hurt and it will be a heavy task but just actually do it don’t talk about it don’t discuss it just break it off. 
Now I say this for multiple reasons but here are the top three
1) You are both young enough to move on and find people you are more compatible with
2) she is fully aware you are frustrated that the relationship has become sexless and has done nothing in 18 months to even try and communicate or compromise with you (having sex bi monthly is not a compromise)
3) I’m telling you from experience I spent four years with the person I thought was the love of my life 3 of those years were sexless and I mean zero and she never once committed to “work on it” just broken promises we talked about it and communicated really well but she just never actually did anything to try and get help. I know I’m a complete stranger to you and this is only advice but I’m telling you now sometimes love just isn’t enough I’m still very much in love with her and we have somehow managed to become friends and I hope that it falls that way for you but trust me your young and you will move on you have an incredibly long time left on this planet don’t let yourself fall into a relationship that is one sided it will kill you!"
rel_10862339,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,358,"Solid advice from bardolphhhh. 

I’m older and been trying to find this recent thread I read somewhere on Reddit about how everyone is so young and impressionable on the relationship subs. We’ve all done it, tested the waters of dating, mixed emotions, uncertainty, etc. but if there’s something most of us older ppl agreed on the thread it was that all these young people asking for advice unnecessarily jump to sticking it out and getting married to people with bright red flags waving left and right and all over. Part of living is being young and dumb to an extent. We have to live and make our mistakes to grow and you will do whatever you decide to do. But there was a common belief that I too hold that is when younger we tend to put up with so much shit we should not have put up with. In your 30s+ you have more incentive to work harder to make things work in a relationship. But in yours 20s- you still have so much life to live that it’s silly to keep forgiving red flags for uncompelling reasons. Not saying don’t try to work things out but stop putting up with unhealthy shit just cuz it’s easy or less risky. 

My point with all this is you are NOT weak and pathetic just because you may be in a weak spot right now.  You may not have the best dating experiences YET, but you deserve the best especially when you’re giving your best. You will do whatever you do but I urge you to do what is best for you and oftentimes what is best is not easy. You deserve a life worth living and you should focus on that right now; uplift yourself and if you’re in a relationship, be sure it’s one where you both uplift each other. That means never calling the other a bitch or crazy and that also means trust in your relationship/not putting the other on surveillance. It doesn’t seem like you have this at all when you should have it in a positive, healthy relationship. Wishing you all the best."

As for the other dirty talk I do say those too, like ""yeah cum for me"" or ""what a hot, sexy cock you have, would love to ride it."" Or something like that.

You did take it too far calling the cops on him unless you were actually being beaten. There’s a difference between smacking someone vs punching/stomping on them. Were you left with bruises, physical scars, broken bones, etc.? What kind of punishment did you expect to receive from them? What did the cops do/say?

No. No no no no no no no. 

There are so many great, wonderful, intelligent people who end up in shitty situations like this. It's part of the trap. Often times relationships like this start out great! The abuse starts little by little, people end up feeling trapped, they end up feeling embarrassed, ashamed, at fault, none of that is true. You know what's great about you? That you're going to get away from this and you're going to be better and stronger for it. 

If a friend came to you for help to get out of an abusive relationship, would you really think anything negative about them? 

Start calling divorce lawyers and see if any of them will do free consultations. There are no good reasons not to do this, just speed bumps you'll have to work past.

You said that you do a lot for your partner and expect nothing in return, but that's not true. A few sentences before you made a huge list of what you expect from your partner. Maybe you should first figure out how to be happy and fullfilled without a partner so you don't expect them to entertain you all the time. You can use toys on yourself when your partner doesn't want to have sex or isn't into your kinks. You can try to find something that's keeping you busy without involving your partner. I don't feel like you're doing as much for your partner as you think you do. In a relationship you have to listen to the other person and figure out what they really need. Surprising someone with something you'd like doesn't mean you truly care for them. It seems more like it's for the purpose of pushing your self-confidence so you don't have to admit you're not perfect, you do so much for others after all. The thing is no one is perfect. A partner isn't there to make you complete. You have to be complete by yourself when you want to have a healthy relationship.

And also, keep in mind that everyone needs friends. Your text sounded a bit like your whole life focuses on your partner and his purpose to entertain and sexually please you. Don't forget your friends and maybe go on a ladie's night one or two time a week when your partner doesn't want to have such an active life."
rel_9504838,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,338,"&gt; he named me wanting to have guy friends as a key factor as to why we shouldn’t get back together. 

I mean he's right, but only because that means you're a functioning adult and he isn't. I've been friends with some of the women in my life for over 20 years - if my now-wife had rolled into my life and demanded I cut them off we'd have broken up pretty damn quickly. But she didn't - she **liked** the fact I had opposite-sex friends, likewise me and her, it's a sign of a well-rounded individual. (Not that if you don't you aren't well-rounded, I hasten to add).

&gt; I would never think of being alone with a guy friend 

Why? Two people don't randomly start fucking each other just because they happen to be alone together. I've gone to the movies with a female friend of mine and guess what? Shock horror, we didn't start making out in the back row, we saw the movie, had a catch up chat, went home. Tada! My wife asked how my friend was, asked about the movie, was glad I had a good time (she couldn't make it that time).

That said, of course boundaries make sense, every couple/person is different, etc. - whatever works for people. But **both** people need to agree - if your husband says ""no male friends"" and you want perfectly healthy platonic male friendships, he doesn't automatically get to have his way just because he's insecure or jealous or has different standards. A reasonable person, even if you weren't on the same page, would want to work **with** you to find a middle ground you were both happy with, not just lay down the law or get mad at you about it - **that's** the sign of someone controlling. If he can't cope with you having male friends you absolutely shouldn't get back together, because you're fundamentally incompatible, and you shouldn't change your perfectly reasonable wants and needs just because he doesn't share them."
rel_10563557,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,477,"I know what you mean but it can still be vulnerable and volatile. 
Earlier this year I met a guy who said we wanted to pursue something more serious, romantically with me, and I felt the same because I felt an immense and deep connection unlike any other before. I thought he felt the same and maybe he did and just got scared. 
Anyway, we tried getting to know each other and were kinda exclusive (he assumed and didnt have the converatjong with me until the last month) for 4 months. Throughout this time tho, he started standing me up and being late, ranting from 15mins (no biggie) to 3 hours late and not showing up at all. And even canceling day of with a few hours notice- for family or friends or for just wanting to spend more time with friends instead. 

It was very clear and evident he wasnt seeing anyone else, he just wasnt willing to put in the work and commitment into a relationship. I ended things one day that he cancelled (btw, he would always cancel when I checked in, he would never let me know as soon as he knew) he had let me know with only 1 he notice after I checked in, during a week when we hadn't seen each other or spoken to each other a lot so it was a big deal kind of date. 

I was direct about things being over then. He never replied and just ghosted me for a month. 
A month later he reached out. After he asking me to go out for drinks 5 times, I finally said yes. He started talking as if nothing ever happened. I finally let him know I couldn't go straight to doing that and he said he wanted to go out a few times and see where we were at, and I said obviously but that I couldn't pretend we were ever just friends. He said he agreed and asked me out for 2 days later. Naturally to him, he never checked in, I finally gave into my old self who almost loved him and checked in half way through the day if we were still on- he never replied, never cancelled, just ghosted me. 

I realized I would never know why, if he didnt actually like me and just wanted to be friends, if I scared him away, if he felt the same but was just afraid of his feelings and didnt want to put in the emotional labor. It just doesnt matter why. Either way, the connection and who he was wasnt what I thought. And just wasn't worth it to me anymore. I still long for that connection again but know it'll just have to be with someone else. Timing and where the other person are at emotionally and maturity wise, is everything"
rel_12027638,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,368,"&gt;Why does it even have to get to this level??

Because she hides how she felt and acted like everything was fine? Because he's under the impression that the current dynamic is acceptable under the relationship? My gf does plenty and more for me at times and I return the favor in other ways. If at any point she walked up and talked to me about how she feels I should do more/less of a certain thing then I would adjust my behaviors and I would expect the same of her if I had issues with something. That's a relationship.

&gt;And it's always because of lazy dudes. Heaven forbid a man clean up after his mess, wash his fucking clothes, make dinner, do his fucking part without resorting to it being a fucking issue.

I hear ""Men are at fault"" from this a little to loud. At this point go back to r/femaledatingstrategy if you want to hate on all men like that. I know plenty of hardworking stay at home/working fathers/boyfriend's who bust their ass working and cleaning for women who don't help in return. I also know women who do that for their S/O who happen to be other women. Your mentality (and I'll quote you here) of ""heaven for bid a man clean up"" is disgusting and I genuinely hope you understand it's not all guys otherwise you really shouldn't be allowed to have a say anywhere on topics such as these due to being biased? 

Back to the matter at hand I repeat dude legit doesn't see and issue and won't until you talk. It doesn't matter if he's got a penis or a vagina the fact at matter is he doesn't know there is an issue as it's probably been normalized with her keeping quiet about it. If she spoke up maybe there could be a healthy relationship change as I would expect in my own relationship. Communication can change everything sorry you can understand that and want to see him be punished for something he clearly doesn't know is happening. I'll repeat there's plenty of behaviors everyone in the world (including you/me) where we wouldn't see the wrongdoing unless called on it."

rel_14898240,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,405,"Couple of things. 

- you need to talk to your wife and get the truth from her instead of trying to piece together a half true story in your head. If you don’t think that you can trust her now or ever to tell you the truth then you can’t move forward with the relationship. Know that it could take time for her to admit to herself and to you what she did. And it is possible that she honestly was so drunk that she just doesn’t remember. See below about counseling. 

- you should not immediately jump to divorce like some people are saying especially since you don’t even know what happened. I’m sure you gave getting married a lot of thought and you should give ending a marriage an equal amount of thought. 

- it sounds like your wife has a drinking problem. This doesn’t excuse any of her actions. It’s one thing to get black out drunk when you’re in your early twenties and don’t have commitments and responsibilities (still not particularly healthy choice though). It’s another thing to do that when you’re a “real adult” with others who depend on you and who are affected by your actions. If her drinking is having a negative impact on her life, which it clearly is, then she needs to seek professional help. You may find that this infidelity is a symptom of the drinking problem. Again this doesn’t excuse what she did or make her any less responsible for her actions. 

- you two probably need to talk with a professional marriage counselor. They aren’t going to try to save your marriage necessarily. They may help you come to the conclusion that this is something that you won’t be able to get past. However, if there is a chance at saving your marriage and you and your wife want to save it, then they will help. They might be able to help you reach a place of trust again. 

Maybe this is worse than it seems and she has been having a prolonged affair. Maybe this is an isolated incident and what really happened was she got drunk and made out with someone like she says. You have to hear the truth from her. Don’t give up. Marriage is hard and and this may be too much to get past. But you have to at least try to get through it. Good luck."

rel_3645590,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,184,"My tip on communication is this: ignore your boyfriend. ""Tell me all the things you're insecure about and don't like it when I do them!"" is a recipe for exactly what happened here. So ignore your bf, and DON'T tell him all the things you're insecure about. He doesn't really want to know; he likes the idea of radical honesty, not the actuality of it. 

Instead, use your discretion and common sense. Tell him the things he needs to know, and keep your own counsel in specific circumstances like this. Work on your insecurities with yourself, not with his participation. If it's something that comes up repeatedly, bring it up to him in a context away from the thing itself (example: a conversation over lunch that goes ""hey, I've realized that I'm not all that thrilled about you following Girl on Instagram, is that something you could not do or is that something I work on myself?""). Bringing it up in a neutral context instead of in the moment helps diffuse his reaction, and gives you time to think about how to say things. "

I also had to find help outside of my family to regain the respect that, relatively speaking, I never deserved to lose. I entered a dark tunnel on the heels of being a victim of intimate partner violence, with close to zero support from my family because … well, I’m gay.  It’s still not talked about. My therapist is the only person I can check in with on my past but I’ve learned to accept that I cannot change others boundaries, even if they’re my mom/dad or siblings. I can only make my own. 

As such, I have found ways to love my family taking the bad with the good. Deep down they are good people.  And when the proverbial sh*t began to hit the fan w my drinking, the veil dropped and they showed up - I wish they had earlier, but better late than never. 

Strict families, especially of privilege, are not built to deal with any of these things. I hope OP knows that their family loves them, even if they cannot express it an operative fashion. It would be easy for someone to reply about how they “wish they could be so fortunate,” but at the end of the day, we are all human, and all subject to struggle in our own unique ways.

It doesn’t sound like you forbade her from going or went straight to an ultimatum that you’d divorce if she goes. It sounds like you simply stated your concern. Maybe told her your preferences for how the situation could be approached?

Your concern does indicate a lack of trust, obviously. Which you have no reason to argue against. Trust in a relationship isn’t unlimited. There are almost always some agreed upon boundaries. So when she says you’re untrusting toward her spending long weekends with a group of single guys, tell her “yes, I wouldn’t hang out and vacation with a group of single women. I don’t think you’d trust that either. Even if you did though, that’s not the kind of marriage that I want.”

Though I would advise you step back and really think about your boundaries and if they’re healthy. You say she goes to her home country frequently. She’s obviously hanging out with these people frequently, whether taking longer weekends with them or not. She has all the opportunity to affair with any of these guys and it’s unlikely you’d know, but you’ve been trusting through many trips previously. What is it about the change in the situation that changes your feelings toward it? Do you think a smaller group gives more opportunity for the guy(s) to start making moves on her? Do you think your spouse is more likely to “slip up” in certain situations like heavy drinking? Because maybe there’s a compromise here to explore."

What I told my then-girlfriend, and what I'll tell you now, is this:

There are various boundaries each partner wants to establish in a relationship, and not all of them have to do with being afraid of infidelity. Some of those boundaries are about propriety and keeping what you consider ""special"" about the relationship just that - special. Obviously something you feel is ""special"" about your relationship with your girlfriend is that you get to touch her butt (apologies if that's crass). The act of someone else touching her butt - *regardless* of their sexual orientation - has little to do with any fear of infidelity, and entirely to do with propriety and your desire to see that act as something special in your relationship. Thus, it's a boundary for you. In general, you don't want other people to get to have the special things in your relationship. In specific, this is one such special thing.

All that to say - You are not wrong to feel uncomfortable. You would not be wrong to bring this up to your girlfriend, but I would explain it the way I did above - about her and your relationship being special, and *completely* leaving out any mention of sexuality."

I dealt with this a while back. In my specific situation she needed help that I couldn't give her. Once she got help and treatment (for anxiety and depression) she got a lot better. That didn't fix everything unfortunately/obviously, but the painful eggshells but was greatly improved. 

So my recommendation is do what you can to get your SO counciling at least and if there are more serious issues maybe those can be addressed too.

rel_9925426,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,304,"Some of this could be written off as misunderstanding or coincidence, but the big red flag to me is that the MIL planned her baby shower for the same day as the OP AFTER finding out what date she planned it.  This is clearly intentional, so you know she's being petty on purpose.  

It sounds like these issues run deeper too, as the husband does not appear to have a great relationship/history with his own father.  While trying to get revenge might feel nice in the short term, starting a petty competition that will only continue to escalate is not the right thing to do, both for the OP and her husband, and for their new baby.  To echo what others have said, the primary focus should be on the child.  Block out the in-laws from social media and non-essential communication, and I would actually advise making it clear to them that you are doing that and why.  Not in an accusatory or disrespectful way, mind you, but just firmly let them know that you are unhappy with the way they have handled that situation and you do not care to associate with them unless they change their behavior.  When the excuses start coming, remind them that it doesn't matter what their reasons are, it hurt you anyway.  If they come to their senses and realize they were wrong, you can all move forward and begin repairing that family relationship.  If they don't, you can move forward as though they don't exist and focus on the family relationships that are healthy.  

Having said all this, I advise always leaving the door open for reconciliation.  Don't compromise your position, but if they come to you asking for forgiveness, forgive them.  This is a really hard thing to do, but being the bigger person always is."
rel_11172726,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,363,"We'll this is how i would handle it if i could think of myself in the best case.

Given that they doesn't seem to think that you have a reason for being upset i wouldn't worry too much based off your description of what happened the only thing i could see is that maybe they misinterpreted you saying *""Hey there. I'm not in the best place  mentally, and I think I need some time to think things through. It's  all happened so quickly, and I'm stuck comparing my old life to this  one.""*  as if they were not good enough for you and maybe some feelings got hurt. But I don't know these people and no one on here will but what I do know is that if they are willing to listen then you likely don't have anything to worry about. and based on the fact that they are asking about it its likely they are going to hear you out. The mood of their text seems a bit cold which makes me think that there was some serious miscommunication in the period that you were taking a mental break.

If i were to be going into this situation i would do my best to remain calm as hard as that might be. In the past I've had some serious downpours of emotion and through experience i know that some people get scared by the proposition that they feel obligated to do something. So don't go into it expecting anything (prepare for the worst but hope for the best) and be prepared to explain the situation as you understand it and don't make any assumptions let them fill in the blanks of the story. And if this is what it seems and they share their point of view maybe you could see it as all one big misunderstanding.

In the case of the worst though and they are being rude, unsympathetic, or just aren't listening then you gotta ask yourself if those are the types of people you want as friends.

If i got any of the details wrong or i missed something let me know I'm happy to talk about it."

UPDATE : guys, thanks for all the comments. Want to clarify that my ex hasn't bothered nor being aggressive at all. After I read all the comments, I talked with my ex about my current relationship which he wished me well. We were friends before we dated that's why we had this friend group and my ex said our 4year relationship is valuable even though we broke up. He doesn't want anything from me now. I also asked my current bf how he feels about me hanging out in this friend group including my ex and he said he's totally fine because he knows I built my friendships for many years as an immigrant. Both of them are emotionally mature and I'm glad I had a talk with them after hearing opinions from ppl here:) 


ORIGINAL : 

I'm 29F and broke up with my ex bf(34M) 4months ago. We dated for 4years.

I'm currently dating other guy and I like him a lot. But My ex hasn't moved on from me and wanna try again. He's a great person and we were always best friends to each other. We have a friend group we hang out together so we see each other often. We still feel like we're friends. 

I want him to move on and be happy and I feel guilty that I moved on. If he finds out that I'm dating someone, he's gonna be upset too. 

Should I tell him that I'm seeing someone? I don't know if I should not worry about him since we broke up but I care about him. What's the best way to let him move on from our relationship for him?"
rel_34541081,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,247,"This is 100% correct. I used to be a total daddy’s girl. We would cook dinner, go camping, go to festivals, etc. 

Then he started dating a woman with 3 kids. I never saw my dad and we essentially stopped any sort of interaction. He actually said that if I wanted to hang out with him I had to go with him to the girlfriend’s house; with her kids that were a holy terror. 

All the kids were older than me, but they were in and out of juvi, kicked out of school, etc. We had nothing in common, but if I wanted to be around my dad I had to be around the GF and her kids. I could tell she didn’t want me there and did everything possible to push me away and build a wedge. 

I ended up moving in with my mom after my dad told me to “get a life” when I tried to talk to him about missing him; I was 15. 

He and the GF got married, I wasn’t invited and only heard about it after the fact. I rarely saw them although they lived close by. 

Now I have almost no relationship with my father and may talk to him 2-3 times a year on the phone. 

OP, think about what this is doing to your daughter and what kind of relationship you want with her. It sounds like Z is forcing your daughter away and she knows it."

I think it's super strange and off putting that you found her clothing so distasteful from the beginning, but for some reason *assumed* that she would change in a direction that suited your preferences later on?

Your issue is a matter of taste and preference, and you can't argue taste or preference. You're not *right* about the way you feel about her clothing. There is no being *right* in this issue.

If her clothing choices are honestly ""repugnant"" to you to the point that you now actually don't feel attraction to her any more, despite the fact that she has *never*, since you've known her, dressed to meet your preferences, you should split up. Your attraction to her sounds super superficial if it can be shaken by something so surface level. If you can't just...get past this, you should split up. I would be devastated to learn that my husbands attraction to me and desire for me was dependent on my style preferences.

All of that being said, and purely out of curiosity, you're not talking about...Lu La Roe, are you? Like, when you say the clothing is nice and expensive designer stuff, we're talking about an ACTUAL designer and not an MLM scam brand, right?

You just got out of a several-year-long relationship *one month ago*. And you've already met and fallen hard for someone else. And you are 23. I know it doesn't seem that way right now when you're infatuated, but the chances that this relationship will be long-term are probably not good.

rel_22755629,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,436,"Your situation reminds me of mine. I'm (32M) Nigerian American, married to a Moroccan(34F). I'm Christian, she's Muslim. Imagine all the possible differences in culture, age, religion. My dad cut me off when he found out we moved together let alone got married. We got married without him knowing and dated for several years as well before we did. He was hoping we would break up with time, but our relationship got stronger because we consciouslly worked on it together. It's not easy, but  its always worth it for someone you love and we both love each other more than our differences. There's easily enough things that could be seen as differences. 

However, my parents were disappointed when they find out we were married, since we didn't have a wedding , just court  only. They changed their tone a bit after they find out my wife was expecting. I've learn over 10 years of dealing with our relationship that some parents over react sometimes because they think no one could ever love their children as much as they do and else no one knows what's best for them as much as their parents. 

We had to have several difficult conversations with my parents in which they apologized not just because we wanted them to, but because they realize after 10years..lol that we all have to learn and grow as individuals to handle things that are not within our comfort zone. Them hearing about your future baby only triggered a longer term perspective for them about how short life is..imo... But at the end of the day, you and your husband both have to feel that they're geniuinly remorseful on how they they treated both of you and not just interested in being grand parents.

I've found out also that's it's even harder for parents from deeper rooted cultures and traditions to accept anything that is different from what they've knonw all their lives and passed on from generations. Its like their world shatters when they see one of their own not following in the same tradition. So trust that you're not the only one and hopefully you both can forgive you the both of you and your future kids, not for them. But its not always easy. I knew that feeling so well keeping my relationship and marriage for 4 years before we all got to a better mental place to accept each other for who we are, not what our culture/religion or country expects you to be. 

Good luck, I hope you guys get there some day and have lots of uncomfortable but meaningful conversations.👍🏽"

rel_1375337,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,406,"**TL;DR: Figure out why you are thinking this! Don't judge yourself based on thoughts! And for the love of god, talk to your damn girlfriend!**

I am by no means the best person to listen to or an expert at all, so take this with a grain of salt.

First off, try to understand where these urges are coming from. Do you not feel sexually satisfied? Or are you simply fantasizing about a hypothetical situation? Or do these urges stem from elsewhere? Sex is a dirty, messy, complex thing, and understanding why we are sexually aroused by something is difficult, but absolutely necessary.

Second, understand that urges are not the same as actions. While you may have thoughts of cheating, you can't beat yourself up for being unfaithful if you've never actually *done* anything. People think about doing things all the time, but it's our actions that hold the most meaning. Don't feel bad for having thoughts. Feel bad if you act on them.

Third, talk to your girlfriend. I'm utterly shocked to see how many problems on this sub can be solved with a good ol' fashioned conversation. Explain to her that you have been having thoughts about infidelity and that you don't understand why you have them. Tell her that you would not ever actually cheat on her, especially since admitting your thoughts is the worst way to hide an affair. Tell her if you aren't sexually satisfied and what you as a couple can do to fix that. Maybe try acting out some of your fantasies through role-play. But make sure, under no uncertain terms, that she realizes you love her and have no intention of ever hurting her by cheating. She may take a while to process the information, but if you are as earnest as I'd like to believe, she should understand and be willing to help. You two are a couple; you'll have to fight this as a couple.

Last, know that any short-term pleasure gained from cheating will not compare to the years, maybe a lifetime, of shit you will put yourself through, the shattered relationship you have with a woman you love. If you want to stay with this girl, which it sounds like you do, think about what kind of pain she would be in if you ever did cheat on her.

If you love this girl, you won't hurt her. Only assholes hurt people they like."
rel_33533079,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,227,"First, I'll try to answer the main post's question.

I personally would be very offended by this, but that being said I am very much mono and would find any situation where my partner was intimate with another person while we're together to be betrayal.  In your situation, however... she didn't seem to act on impulses until AFTER the relationship was opened up, which if you've ever had a one night stand, yeah kissing and more can happen on the first day.  That being said, I don't necessarily know the nuance or details surrounding the rules or boundaries put in place by you guys so I can't really pass judgement here.

Now in response to the replied comment.

It sounds like she might have been a bit deceitful in how she thought about the girl or how she explained it to you.  She was attracted to her but did not view her as a potential partner tells me (in this context) that the only thing stopping her from pursuing was monogomous restriction and not necessarily her feelings towards you.  What I mean is while she cared enough for you to restrict herself because of the nature of the relationship, it wasn't because of how you felt about the situation as a whole.

By opening the relationship, you've opened Pandora's box... good luck from here on out, friend"

rel_24380284,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,439,"&gt;My (50) boyfriend (44) of eight years has never said I love you to me. I said those words to him about 1 year into our relationship and he said he ""wasn't there yet"".  I have never said it since nor has he volunteered it to me. He has always been very secretive about his past relationships to some extent (the longest being a little over 3 years, with someone he was thinking of marrying).  I've always assumed this was the love of his life but he recently admitted that his ""soul mate"" was a woman he dated when he was between 20-22 who died in a car crash.  According to him, this woman was the love of his life and his soul mate.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; So where does that leave me?  We've been living together for the past 3 years and he's thoughtful, affectionate but has always lacked romance. He doesn't celebrate anniversaries, take me on romantic dates, or things like that, there's no pet names for me and absolutely no talk of engagement or marriage at all.  You might ask why I'm still with him, well, I guess you'd say I saw a lot of potential in this relationship. Under other circumstances, he could be the love of MY life but I hold back a lot for fear of rejection.  We have so much in common, get along great and we sync together in the bedroom as well. Now I'm at the crossroads.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I'm getting older and I miss being with someone who is crazy about me.  I have had such relationships in the past, so I know they exist, but as years go by, I am doubting more and more that I will ever have such a relationship with him. Friends tell me that I've invested so much time in this relationship, I should stick it out, and that it's better to have a stable relationship than be hung up on romance. Yet, without a declaration of love, it doesn't seem that stable to being with. Should I move on and try to find my happily ever after with someone else? Am I too old for romance?  He says that we're too old for that kind of stuff when I bring it up.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;What should I do? I need advice here. Help please!!

Its been suggested a few times that i might be on the spectrum (from people i trust and love and a lot more from people i dont), but i have never been diagnosed.

Honestly, at this point it isnt so much about being good enough for ideal person: i try to believe that i will meet the right person eventually, and i know i can because i have met empathetic dates &lt;10 mo, got co dependent and unhealthu, partwd as friends&gt;... its more, i need to be okay to even break the cycle and i am not okay. Been in in patient 5 years ago out pt within the year had theroay until i lost my job.

rel_15219104,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,301,"Plan your exit, don't tell him you're leaving and document everything. I can't stress this enough.

My ex developed a closet drug problem and became very controlling and abusive. He tried to bring me down with him and whenever I tried to leave he used our dog as emotional blackmail, which always worked. Against my better judgement, I stayed and I didn't tell anyone about his issues out of fear of being judged. 

Then one night he was picking me up from work and saw me talking to a male co worker out front. When I got in the car, he accused me of flirting with him. I told him he was being ridiculous and laughed it off. He then drove me to an empty parking lot and we started to argue and he beat me until I was barely conscious. He pushed me out of the car and left me there bleeding. Once he realized I would probably go to the cops he came back and pulled me back in. He forced me to stay in his basement for 2 weeks until the bruises healed. He broke my phone so I couldn't call anyone or take pictures of the bruises. 

That's when I knew if I didn't leave, he would probably kill me. I planned my exit and made my move, I even managed to escape with my dog. I lived in fear for years after that, until I got news that he OD'd last year, but I've never regretted doing what I did.

I can remember one time when I was in high school coming home so high (It was the 70s, everyone was doing it, LOL) I was actually scared I'd done too much. I was so scared, I walked into my parent's bedroom and woke up my mom, telling her everything.

She actually sat up with me most of the night just talking me thru it. She never punished me for getting so high, and to be honest, I never did drugs again, it scared me that much. I appreciated her SO much more the next day. I actually cooked dinner that night to thank her and she was thrilled. (I'm the youngest of five kids and my mom hated having to do all the cooking.)

(I think someone might have slipped something into a joint I'd smoked, because I got WAY too high on one joint and was kind of slurring and blacking out. It was freaky.)"

I think you’re doing everything you possibly can for one person without even thinking about what that person is doing for you and it seems as a result she is getting used to exploiting you like this. 

It literally seems like she expects you to go crazy for her while she does the absolute minimum for you.

I would straight up tell her that nobody who literally has used you to cheat on their thesis and “graduate” can tell you what to do and you need to demand that there be some immediate changes and that she better start pulling her weight in the relationship and dedicate just as much of herself in supporting you as you did to support her. If she isn’t willing to do that, then she isn’t worth even 1% of the effort you have given her sadly."
rel_18022890,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,455,"I agree. I abhor people using their past to justify bad behavior.

I sound like a broken record and have briefly mentioned this twice on here about how I was horribly abused growing up. When it was exposed, my biofather kind of did what Donald Trump did with the 60 Minutes interview (I hope you get the reference) and he knew that once it came out, it would be bad and it would hurt him. Oh, and he was a teacher at my high school and nominated for Teacher of the Year. 

So, he started telling people at school early that there would be a protective order out ""against him"" (he didn't say ""for youreyesmystars"" or anything else) and he warned that most of it was lies, that I was coerced by the divorce lawyer (what??) and that he was trying to get help. he had so many on his side, when i wasn't planning on telling anyone at school. A few weeks in, and a random teacher alluded to it, it brought up alarm bells, and i figured out what happened. 

People attacked my mother and I like crazy bringing up that he was in the Vietnam War and that what he did was wrong, but I needed to be more understanding (easy for them to say, they should see how they feel after being choked and having no airflow or beaten with a broomstick).....and that he too was abused as a child.....blah blah blah. Nothing in regards to my mother and me, and I have been in therapy for over ten years and I'm still very much not over it. I haven't used it as an excuse though to hurt other people like he did. i remember one time telling him this and he said that it was because people react to trauma in different ways (and I could go on and on with this) but my POINT is that people do this to get a pass for bad behavior and we are supposed to just accept it. What about OP's feelings and him working so hard?

I have done many things wrong in my life, but all decisions and actions i have made, have been my own. I haven't cheated on a partner or harmed ANYONE. And I have been through the worst. OP's ex is going to milk the ""I'm disabled/my mom died/abused"" scenario for as long as she sees that it might be working. And those hysterical fits are dangerous. At some point, she is going to feel like she has nothing to lose and do something dangerous as well as exploit tenant laws. He needs to amputate the dead limb before necrosis sets in.

Crying from cramps and getting sent home from school was a monthly occurrence for me. The best decision I made was getting a hormonal IUD, all symptoms (and periods) disappeared for 3 years, it was incredible. In the meantime I advise you get her an electric heating pad and tell her to take hot bathes, heat really helps with the cramps. After 3 years the cramps started to come back. I got an excision surgery literally yesterday and the doctor said I did not have any endo around my ovaries or Fallopian tubes, which is what makes you infertile. Ask your daughter where exactly she feels the pain in her abdomen, that could give a hint where the endo is located. It’s very unlikely the endo has reached her ovaries or tubes by now as she is so young, she really shouldn’t worry about it now. I went through the same infertility scares when I was diagnosed but the infertility statistics vary so widely (every stat I see is wildly different from the last) that I wouldn’t take them very seriously. Most women who have endo don’t even know they have it, so the women counted in those statistics would only be the ones with really extreme cases who have had surgery to officially diagnose it. Getting diagnosed with endo is scary, but once you figure out the right treatment plan it’s really not so bad! Good luck to you both"

Alternately, maybe try online dating, if you’re dead set on trying to form a relationship as soon as possible.

People would be saying op has every right to get into that phone/icloud acct under any means necessary to delete those sexual nude photos if he were female. Like....what if they break up and their SO uses those pics as some sort of revenge porn (which is very common and also illegal in some states) but noooooo.. no female is capable of such things. (/s) How dare he take it upon himself to invade HER privacy like that just so he can delete sexually explicit photos of himself when SHE refused to respect his wishes and delete them herself? Obviously their relationship is on the rocks, obviously he doesn't trust her so why tf would he trust her with those pics of him on her phone?? Clearly she gets off on having the pics in her possession to use them against him in some way (at some point) which is why she refused to delete them. 

That being said, he is old enough where he should know better than to have allowed those pics to end up on her phone in the first place and this is the consequence he has to deal with. However, regardless of gender, nobody deserves to have sexual pics of themselves in the hands of anyone they don't trust that clearly has no respect for them with suspicious intentions with the pics.. Even if they are idiots or made an idiotic decision for whatever reason that they now regret.

Basically, op is responsible for his own stupid choice he made and his girlfriend is unstable for to remove the pics upon: request. As far as up/downvotes...I'm unsure as to why op cares because this9 relationship us ::c' doomed any way. "

From what I’m seeing, she feels guilty and is trying to let you down easy. With that being said, why not just try to be friends at least. I would let her go as a girlfriend and maybe just be friends or friends with benefits.

Becoming like him will not change how you feel. It will not resolve these issues.   


The only way to resolve these issues if you were able to communicate with him. But if he refuses to communicate, it is time to let him know that your ship is going to sail off. And if he doesn't want to be aboard on that ship, that is his choice.  


You want to move on in your life to have healthy relationships, to grow with a suitable partner, to experience great things and connect and build a future.

Few couples ever die at the exact same instant. If they don't, one of them ends up alone, even if they were together for 65 years before the first one died. That's life.

The practical question is how to spend your time now. It may make sense to accept, at any point in your life, that looking for a partner, in one way or another, is not the best use of your time. I imagine most 70-year-olds would be wasting their time on Tinder. Most 19-year-olds would be wasting their time looking for a suitable partner at the retirement home.

It is absolutely true that some people have a far easier time in the relationship market than others. You may be perfectly correct that your own prospects are relatively poor, and that your time would be better spent making money in your chosen career, than going on another singles cruise. That's fair enough. The world may look different, though, in another five years. If you were approached by a good prospect in five years, would you shut it down because of something you were silly enough to 'accept' five years before? What sense would that make?

rel_15789435,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,401,"There’s a lot of good advice here and I’m late to the party but I just wanted to offer the perspective as a woman who has been in your girlfriend’s shoes. 

First of 100% you did nothing wrong and you have every right to say no and have your partner respect that and you do not need to apologize for asserting your boundaries. 

Having said that, I think you two should have a chat about it. I hate the whole hostile “you did nothing wrong and this isn’t your problem” reaction you can get on reddit. Sure you did nothing wrong but I’m a relationship where you care about each other you need to work through these kinds of issues in a way that makes you both feel good about things, and that hopefully also makes your relationship stronger in the long run.

I think the genders absolutely do matter here in the sense that as women we’re constantly told that men always want sex and that a lot of our value is based on our sexual desirability. Now that’s all crap that is on its way out but the message is still out there more than it should be. 
Rejection always sucks but I think men from an early age are told that when it comes to sex women are not always in the mood and so it’s a lot easier to not take rejection personally. Whereas when you’re a woman and you first experience the “not in the mood” rejection it makes you feel like there’s something wrong with you and your partner doesn’t desire you. 

I think you just need to have a nice talk together about how you not being in the mood has nothing to do with your attraction to her and just help reassure her and to understand that you have a varying sex drive just like anyone else and that it’s a misconception that men are always down to have sex. Also I think it’s important to tell her that her reaction made you feel like you did something wrong so that you can talk through her feelings too, I know I got pouty but I wasn’t trying to make my partner feel guilty—I just felt bad about myself. I imagine it’s similar for your girlfriend. Hopefully you two can come to a better understanding that prevents this kind of conflict in the future."

The content they view, what they find attractive, I think is just so much more complicated than the binary view you have. Of them wanting specifically that. It's more subconscious, probably based on their previous experiences, maybe just even what they're accustomed to masturbating to.

I can't think of any logical reason someone would know they have an STD and not get it treated ASAP. If she didn't cheat, it's possible she got tested at some point before her last relationship and knew she was clear. So it makes sense if she hasn't cheated and she suddenly has an STD that the only place she could have got it was her ex.

The symptoms were there and then gone, and then weeks later I was in a new relationship and my partner contracted the STD and that's how I found out I had it. I showed symptoms for a day and then I treated a yeast infection and they went away. There are scenarios people with more knowledge about gonorrhea have presented that show it's possible she didn't cheat and it really was laying dormant.

On top of that, for a cat to respond to YOUR cats name while also being a different cat and only given 1 month to potentially ""train"" it just doesn't add up.

Your cat missed you. Also, if you are speaking in a higher pitched voice I'd suggest changing that. They lose lower and more calming tones. Often the most simple answer is usually the one that is the most likely.

Cats are very independent creatures so her not responding is probably her wanting to be alone and undisturbed. The fact she is wanting to be around yoy just goes to show that she loved you and her responding to her name could very will have been some how passively ingrained into her through your friend wanting to check on her when she was watching your cat."

Her crying and yelling when my dad talks to her has happened a lot before but it was over stupid things that my sister and I were confused about. We would wonder why that would buy her because it would be over stuff similar what is happening during the week. My sisters and I have always wondered what my dad did wrong with that. Her screaming at the top of her lungs is a new thing. I try to say I love you but she has been screaming from her room f*** you. My dad has dealt with so much with her. She was a stay at home mom and now works in a school office.
rel_24751225,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,101,"Sex is meant to be enjoyed by both parties or else it's not really sex anymore. He is practically using you as a flesh light and I hate to put it that way but when you're having ""sex"" with someone who doesn't care about your pleasure that's what it truly is. Unfortunately many women experience the same thing and it's not right and should not be normalized.
OP you are more than within your bounds to ASK for pleasureful, enjoyable sex and you deserve better. I just can't understand why someone would be against pleasuring the person they're having sex with."
rel_31309812,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,134,"That's reasonable, being ignored is not good for our psyche.  That said, sometimes friends are too busy.  Or are choosing something else over responding to you.  You can internalize that, you could consider that perhaps what your posting just isn't meeting them where they're at (you're asking time-extensive questions lets imagine).

Internalizing it though doesn't mean it'll fix it, may actually do your psyche more harm, etc.  Know that you can't change how people act.  That's only on them.  So the other part to this is to distance yourself a bit from those that leave you on read.  Don't let their actions, effect your emotional state as much.  Recognize to yourself where you're at, and what it is that you need.  And that might mean more distance from this group, possibly permanently, possibly temporarily."
rel_13134025,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,257,"Your husband may be a good man but he doesn't have your best interests at heart. He's slowly killing you.

I was once 358lbs (high weight) and I remember how miserable and achy I was. It took me meeting my current spouse to get active and get myself HEALTHY! That's always been his priority with me. Not making sure that I get thinner because he hasn't dated bigger women. He doesn't care about that. We have sex on a regular basis. But he talks to me about food habits because he wants me to be HEALTHY.

My point (as I've sure 100 other people here have said) is to make the change. Do the grocery shopping yourself and serve yourself. The weight will fall off, trust me. Stop the soda, cut your meals in half and start going for a walk after dinner. You don't need to be thin if you don't want to but at the very least 200lbs was a good and healthy weight for you it sounds like and getting it off is hard.

Save your own life rather than feeding your husband's fantasy. He won't find a specialist. He will have to find a regular therapist who can talk him through his sexual habits and make him realize that his fantasy is wanting you to be huge is putting your life in jeopardy.

P. S. Address the fact that he waited until you were married to reveal this fetish. It may have changed your mind about actually marrying him when you were smaller."

You need your own time for your friendships and your hobbies. Games are a great way to connect with friends, relax, and unwind.

You are an adult. You get to manage your own time. HER STRICT PARENTS SHOULD NOT AFFECT YOUR LIFE. How they've raised her if up to her to respond to. Not yours.

She's not just the sleep police, but she the damm life police. She's not your parent. I suggest you have a talk with her and remind her that you're an adult.

I actually am in therapy and my therapist has been pushing me to have this conversation with my ex for months, and express my feelings for people more honestly. I didnt agree with her at first, but I think it will be good for me to be honest so I can move on. 

Of course I hope we can get back together. I am not denying that at all, I just also know it's unlikely, and I wont be shocked when that does not happen. But I think the rejection will really help me, although I know it will hurt very badly.

I dont think this conversation is going to cause a big speedbump in his life (he is not with anyone)--I have considered that carefully. I intend to do it as respectfully as possible, and make clear I dont have expectations of him even owing me the conversation. And if he doesnt want to have it, that is an answer in and of itself.

rel_19733436,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,459,"I think there a lot of small elements that factor into how this goes. 

1. Audience - Just you two. May be an obvious statement when it comes to personal relationships, but I'll never ceased to be amazed at the lack of awareness in some. 

2. Setting - Make sure you are somewhere that you both are able to feel vulnerable or have a history of being safely vulnerable. If it is home great, but maybe car rides are where you sort stuff out. But a place where you both feel comfortable does wonders for the anxious subconscious. 

3. Be prepared - Not only in mentally what and how you want to address the issue, but more so emotionally prepared. Think about all the outcomes that could come from you addressing this, and try to be accepting of the good and bad outcomes before they get there. While you are in calm state, really get to know yourself and how you'd respond to any tough news or responses he may give. They will be a good guide for what could go wrong, and not let you spiral into a place you feel helpless. Know where you're going if it blows up bad. Know who you're going to call, know whether or not something is a deal breaker, etc. 

4. Be genuine, but tactful - If this shit crushes your soul, tell him. Just make sure that it is genuine to how you feel and not said with any, accusation, offenses, or jabs at him. Like don't say, ""This crushes my soul, because I know you look at other women ALL the time!"" But try to keep it earnest and true to how you feel without a rap sheet of suspicions or projected feelings. Let him know that you've taken the time to think about everything, and that the purpose wasn't to offend him, but to help deal with the things that keep you up and are made anxious by. You want to deal with this to grow in your relationship and not cut it off, and that should be made clear. 

5. LISTEN - Not only listen to how he feels, what he thinks, and what is happening, but listen for the content of what is being said, and most importantly what is NOT being said. If it's all defensive and putting it all back on you, there is a strong chance for bullshit. If he hears you out and gets where you're coming from, great. But if you have lines you need to set down, be clear about what they are and listen to how he agrees if he does, if there ends up being some loopholes he is avoiding. Be careful.

I would NOT let it go, jsut forget it and move on and she seems to want to NOT learn how destructive and evil her behavior is.  I would highly suggest marriage counseling of some sort, probably also some serious details about the finances of the house. 

Who pays the bills, do you have a joint account, does she spend your money on these stupid ideas and think it is ok?  You need to make sure she no longer has access to the family financial reserves. her actions are divorce level scary. i am not saying you should file the paperwork but you need to make it clear that her behavior and attitude and threats are crossing the line too far.  They cannot be forgotten. 

Whatever you said in the past, if it was this level, even more reason to seek counseling.  But if it was hurtful but not threatening? then fuck that your wife is crazy and needs a reality check.   "

Different things work for different people. It's OK if this is something he doesn't want (although, I find it deeply weird he wouldn't want you to have your own space, but I'm biased). But it's also OK if this is something you want, and it's OK if you insist on this as a necessary condition of living together.


One thing I don't suggest is waiting a year. When you move in, it **must** - absolutely MUST - go from his home to your(plural) home together. I don't mean legally, of course in ownership terms it's his house, his asset. I mean emotionally. It must became a shared home, and one doesn't wait around a year to see if it's OK for them to claim reasonable personal space in their own home."
rel_29915104,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,313,"You do not want to be in a relationship with him and it isn’t working out to be friends. I think you can express this to him and offer a few options.

1) cut off all contact and give each other space to heal and move on. If you want, you guys could revisit the idea of restating the friendship in a year or two.

2) remain friends but any discussion of sexual/romantic relationships is off-limits. This may be hard because you may find things out through mutual friends or social media and want to ask questions.

3) keep the relationship as is with the understanding that you will be dating and having sex with people and he will need to come to terms with that.

Think carefully about your boundaries before the conversation and make them clear to him. It sounds like this has mostly been about HIS needs and HIS feelings so far… those are his responsibility. What do YOU want?

Also have a plan for if things aren’t going well. For example, if you agree not to talk about relationships and he brings it up anyway, how do you want to handle that.

And by the way, he needs to be actively engaged in answering these questions. It sounds like you’re doing a lot of the emotional work here to find a solution he’s comfortable with. Stop. Tell him, “I want to date people and it sounds like it really upsets you to know that. What do you think we should do about that?” Then let him try to come up with a solution that works for both of you.

Ultimately these are his problems and he’s making them your problems. You don’t have to take that on. You can care very much for someone and not be able to be in a relationship or friendship with them. 

Good luck!!"

rel_10790426,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,263,"I'm gonna go a bit against the grain here and actually say that this behavior typically follows a pattern that doesn't turn out well in the end, and if it's already making you feel like you owe him, you're gonna have to have a chat and tell him to pump the brakes a little, lol.

Now, I am absolutely not accusing your boyfriend of anything or attempting to paint him in a bad light. *However,* I have definitely seen a pattern where people throw a ton of money into a relationship thinking it will make their partner stay, and these people often feel, down the line, that they can neglect the emotional labor involved in a relationship because of the material gifts they gave a person.

Now obviously your boyfriend isn't some cold or manipulative asshole, lol, but he's still unknowingly following an unhealthy pattern. Instead of asking what physical goods you can give back to him, maybe sit down with him and talk about how you can both spend time together and show your affection for each other without buying things. Hell, instead of a fancy restaurant, maybe ask him to indulge in some junk food with you for a movie night on the couch or something. :)

Edit: because I feel like I came off harsh somehow, basically what I meant is that a lot of guys need to be reminded that they don't have to throw all their money and hard work at a person, and that they'll still be loved even if they don't ""provide for"" their partner, lol."

Be careful, and remember that you needing to look out for yourself in *no way* is harmful to her.  It might be unpleasant for her but long term? She *does* need to figure herself out. And if it takes you leaving? Thats fine. 

While you shouldn't be looking out for yourself *because* it will be better for her too, i do know that in situations like these (ive also been in similar spots) it can be hard to put aside concern for the person youve been doing so much for.

rel_27572430,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,274,"I was like this with my ex girlfriend.

I am, honestly, a lazy shit. I let laundry pile up, kept used plates next to the sink and very, very rarely cleaned the bathroom. Every other household task that I DID do was usually because my girlfriend asked me to do it - never of my own volition. Sometimes I would open a binbag and put it next to the bin instead of simply taking the rubbish out and replacing it. 

Not once did it occur to me that while I just spun around living my best life in ignorance, my girlfriend worked her arse off to keep a household. She would wash my clothes, clean the bathroom, sort out the cat litter, and I was either ignorant or wilfully so. 

She tried to tell me, and I joked it off. We argued, but kissed and made up - maybe I'd try for a week, maybe two, but I'd eventually return to my old ways.

When it got to the point that she was ringing the GP to order my prescription and then go to pick it up (while I sat on my computer and meekly accepted it), it was the end. She was not my partner - I had allowed her to become my carer.

This is not healthy dynamic. No relationship can last if these conditions continue. Ultimately, it is your boyfriends responsibility to man up and do what he needs to do. 

Now, in hindsight, I am mortified about my actions. I will never, ever let myself get to that point again. I know what I did wrong, and regret it immensely."

rel_4670321,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,207,"Yes, that’s why you have to not eat the same as someone else who doesn’t have a metabolic factor working against them. You can’t eat/work out the same as a metabolically normal person who is eating at a 1-2lb a week caloric deficit and expect to lose the same. 

And let me rephrase. Weight loss is simple, not easy. There are a lot of mental hurdles you have to overcome to be successful, especially of you have willpower issues, and you have to take this as a life change and not a temporary fix. I say that it was easy for me because once that clicked for me the weight has been coming off steadily and easily. People who don’t think of it as a lifestyle change and just a diet are the ones who fail in the long term. They go back to eating too much and put back on the weight (and if you’re referencing the biggest loser study in regards to long term weightloss that study was incredibly flawed). It’s simple. Calories in - calories out. Adjust accordingly for your own personal circumstances and you will indeed lose weight. Or maintain, if that’s your goal. Or gain, if that’s your goal.

I'm not fully certain how quickly things like this get handled once you report them, so navigating keeping younger brother safe in the meantime without the cooperation of his parents might be tricky to navigate.

Now I feel bad because I know I hurt him by saying how I feel and he hearing it different (maybe I acted impulsive and said things more rude then I should) and he told me he doesn’t want to do anything with me anymore and I really just don’t wan’t that person I truly care about feels that way about me when I never had intention of hurting him. The facts are that his behaviour wasn’t right lately and I was pushing him to see each other and talk about it so me pushing I feel made him close himself more. I really believe that in every relationship there should be understanding from bith sides and rigt now I feel it is one sided but then I think again and my brain plays the game of constant thinking and overthinking. I am just trying to understand is he like this because of his ex or because maybe he was like this in that relationship, too… However, I am truly emotionally drowned and I still care for him and love him. :("

- Fantastic that he wants to teach the kids language and culture from their own heritage. It will make it so much easier for them to communicate with their grandparents. Bonus, it is one of the most useful and widely spoken languages on earth. 

- Highly recommend encouraging the grandparents to talk to the children in Chinese not English. Exceptions of course when in company with others. 

- You will inevitably feel either some pressure to learn too, or like you are being excluded. I’d encourage you to learn the basics - greetings, names and titles, table manners, names of their favourite foods - and honestly that will get you most of the way there. Assuming his language is Mandarin, it is’t that hard to pick up the basics - only 4 tones and very “straight” intonation, not like eg. Vietnamese. If you get the urge you can then take it further; if not you’ve made enough of an effort for it to count. 

- I think it is great that you’re getting into Japanese now! I’m from Australia, where basically everyone outside the Deep North  acknowledges their heritage (the country is only 119 years old and Australian citizenships was only introduced in 1949!!). Melting pot beats assimilation every time ; )"

But I'm in a somewhat similar situation where I'm the older, late 30s guy. Got to know the girl through friends as part of a sort of group activity. She is very attractive, as are many people as it is a more fitness oriented group.  At this point, it is solely a friendship with no intention of trying to make it anything more. It's cool to have someone with a different perspective and vibe. I've given her some career advice and she's invited me to fun activities I may not have otherwise been exposed to. 

There's been guys who assumed I must be trying to sleep with her. I've probably felt the need to over-explain the situation to women I was casually dating, but ultimately that is all very minor in the grand scheme of things.

Anyway, it's best to keep an eye out for warning signs of differing intentions in this sort of thing, but there's nothing wrong with it and can be great so long as everyone is genuine."

I guess I just had the expectation that she would be a reasonable parent and include him in the conversation or at least explain it to him appropriately, but she wants me to look like the bad guy for when he’s sad. Which he’s going to get sad regardless because I have to fly home at some point. She somehow thinks more time will ease that? No length of time will ever be enough. 

Part of being direct with her in my plans is she will then tell me with “it’s probably better if you don’t come then. Come when you can leave your fiancé behind.” It’s all or nothing with her.

rel_32235762,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,666,"**Is it safe to be in a relationship with a person like this?**

No, not at all, Field. With most pwBPD, the abusive and petulant behavior does not occur until you're 4 to 6 months into the relationship. Until then, the infatuation convinces her that you're the nearly perfect man who has arrived to rescue her from unhappiness. In that way, the infatuation holds her two fears at bay. When that infatuation starts to evaporate, however, both fears return and you cannot avoid triggering them.

In contrast, your GF started abusing you only a few weeks into the relationship. Indeed, you had 5 or 7 fights in a relationship that is only 2 months old. Moreover, these fights included her punching you and throwing a beer bottle at you. 

Sadly, if your GF is a pwBPD, you should expect her behavior to get much worse. And you can expect that the emotional damage to you likely will be more damaging than the physical abuse.

**When we woke up this morning, she wasn't okay again... she clearly can't get over a single fact that is so minor.**

If you are in a BPD relationship, Field, whatever minor thing you do or say will be hurtful to her much of the time. A comment or action that pleases her on one day may greatly offend her when repeated a week later. A pwBPD often will perceive you as being hurtful when you DO something and hurtful when you DON'T do it.  
  
This conundrum is due to the position of her two great fears -- abandonment and engulfment -- at opposite ends of the very same spectrum. This means you often find yourself in a lose/lose situation because, as you back away from one fear to avoid triggering it, you will start triggering the fear at the other end of that same spectrum.  
  
Your predicament is that the solution to calming her abandonment fear (drawing close and being intimate) is the very action that triggers her engulfment fear. Likewise, the solution to calming her engulfment fear (moving back away to give her breathing space) is the very action that triggers her abandonment fear.  
  
As you move close to comfort her and assure her of your love, you eventually will start triggering her engulfment fear, making her feel like she's being suffocated and controlled by you. Because she has a weak sense of self-identity, she easily becomes very enmeshed in your strong personality during sustained periods of closeness and intimacy. Yet, as you back away to give her breathing space, you will find that you've started triggering her abandonment fear.  
  
In my 15 years of experience with my BPD exW, I found that there is no midpoints solution (between ""too close"" and ""too far away"") where you can safely stand to avoid triggering those two fears. Until a pwBPD learns how to better regulate her own emotions and tame her two fears, that Goldilocks position will not exist. This is why a relationship with an untreated pwBPD typically is characterized by a repeating cycle of push-you-away and pull-you-back.  
  
Indeed, even if you are sitting perfectly still and not saying a word, a pwBPD who is experiencing hurtful feelings will project those feelings onto YOU. Her subconscious does this to protect her fragile ego from seeing too much of reality -- and to externalize the pain, getting it outside her body.  
  
Because that projection occurs entirely at the subconscious level, she will consciously be convinced that the painful feeling or hurtful thought is coming from YOU. This is why an untreated pwBPD usually BELIEVES the outrageous accusations coming out of her mouth (at the moment she is saying them).  
  
Hence, as long as you remain in a relationship with an untreated pwBPD, you will often find yourself hurting her -- i.e., triggering her engulfment fear as you draw near, triggering her abandonment fear as you draw back, and triggering her anger even when you are sitting still and saying absolutely nothing."
rel_5247890,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,235,"This is a pretty unique dream (first time I've heard of it). So take what I say lightly, but I hope I can help. 

If you're 100% sure about R, then the dream shouldn't be taken literally. It could stand for something; say when you were told she was positive since she allegedly took two tests, a part of you could have accepted the idea of having a child. So, when it didn't happen, that part was let down and now it's kind of questioning what if you actually did have a child. It does not have to mean this specifically because I don't know all of your thoughts and feelings. 

I'm saying this from a similar personal experience where I'd have dreams of getting back with my ex and it would feel really nice in my dreams, then I'd wake up and question if I was over her or not. In reality, it was my subconscious putting her as an embodiment of my want/need for intimacy or a relationship. It messed up my feelings about her because I really thought I might not be over her, when I felt as though I was.  

To summarize, if you are confident enough to say you are over K and you're soulmate is R, then the dream could just be a random nightmare or there are some underlying feelings that you might need to consider thinking about. "

What grown man doesn’t understand a woman in lingerie masturbating in the common area of the house is an invitation to participate? This lacks a basic understanding of women amoung other things. We generally take longer to get started and/or climax. We generally need more then penetration to climax. Many women need to be warmed up more then men so this can be done by yourself or with your partner. Many women assist in the act of sex to arouse themselves to reach climax. This is not an insult to our partners, it’s how we are designed. It’s supposed to be a partnership in the endeavor for a woman to climax, it’s not just someone doing it to her. And who gets disgusted by their partner masturbating? Like are you 12? I don’t care how hurt OP’s husband was feeling or how much he misunderstood what was happening, it was a shitty thing to say designed to be hurtful.

I haven’t been sexually attracted to him for a while, and I’ve expressed this to him in the past, but nothing has changed.

He plays video games all the time, which is fine, but like that’s it besides watching tv. I’ve been working out and going hiking, but he doesn’t want to come. He has a lot of financial issues due to his dad screwing him up, so he doesn’t go out for drinks with my friends and I. I just think my needs and wants are different, and if I saw my boyfriend at a bar and we weren’t dating, I’d look right past him. That being said, I love and care for him SO much.. just not sure if I’m ‘in love’ with him. He treats me well.. he also was my first, but not his first. Help!!!!!

You are no longer sexually attracted to him. 

You have to tell him to do basic things like brush his teeth. 

He does not engage with you in activities (hiking, social stuff).

It was his choice to break up with you, so he doesn't get to question what you did or how you did it (and truthfully, you're an adult, you don't need to justify yourself to him). If you stay with him and nothing changes, this is what your life looks like with him. Passionate is just a very nice way of saying extremely jealous in this situation, and that shits going to get super old, if it hasn't already. 

Honestly, I truly believe he did you a huge favor by breaking up with you initially, and I think he's doing you one now by showing you this streak. You don't owe him any explanations. You've done nothing shameful unless you truly believe in your heart it to be shameful. My guess is that his ""punishment"" is what's is getting you to doubt yourself. 

You say you shouldn't have lied. I'd argue first and foremost it's none of his fucking business what you did unless you're about to give him some communicable disease. Secondly, his behavior gave you no choice but to stay silent about what happened during your break, because all that was going to do was set you up for more abuse. Make no mistake, that's what his actions are. He might not be physically hurting you, but he is doing a hell of a number on your emotional and mental state. 

Do yourself a humongous favor, drop the extra 180lbs (or whatever the fuck he weighs), and find yourself a guy who wouldn't even consider to treat you this way. If the words ""That's not like you"" or any variation thereof are in a man's vocabulary, you should read that as ""You're not who I want you to be, so I'm going to shame you until you become the little doll I want you to be"" and run like hell.

rel_36581805,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,236,"First thing, give it time. You're still young and there's so much that will change in your future over the next decade. If you're worried about legacy, the whole you're still young thing still applies - there are many ways to leave a legacy on this world, and you getting a PhD and putting that to use is one of them.

That said, I'm in a similar boat as you but twice-ish your age. My wife doesn't want kids and I've always assumed I'd have some by now. I am 100% ok not having them. While they are a blessing, they are a burden. Not many parents will ever say they would trade their kids in for the world, but I suspect some of them are lying. It is nice to have freedom, extra disposable income, and less worries in life. I'm sure I'd be a great dad, but I'm also sure I'm a great husband and enjoying my life without kids. I'm not sure I'm really helping with this second part of my answer only that maybe it will help you understand that unless it's something you really REALLY want in life, you can probably do without. If you love this woman - I mean really love her and will spend your entire life cherishing her, then support her. She has made her decision while you haven't, so there's not much argument to be had."

rel_29052130,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,223,"i think there are a few things that need to be addressed here.

first, you are not a failure. i (a woman, for clarification) have a boyfriend who i love very much. i’m very attracted to him and i do enjoy when we do things in the bedroom. however, a problem i’ve had with multiple partners is that i’ve been unable to finish. at one point my boyfriend gave me head for an hour and nothing; although it was very enjoyable. after doctor visits and sex therapist consultation, it comes down to me just needing more extreme stimulation, which my boyfriend was always willing to do. you and your boyfriend should talk about this, it could be the case for him.

but watching porn while you’re performing sexual acts?? uh uh. huge red flag right there. that’s something that you guys need to talk about immediately. it’s been proven that porn damages relationships quite a bit, and it sounds like it’s definitely hurting yours. i would also maybe talk to him about the pros and cons of porn, without being condescending - it’s definitely easy to talk that way when engaging in these kinds of conversations.

but, like many others here have said, it sounds like your boyfriend has a lot of unresolved sexual dysfunction and absolutely none of that is your fault."
rel_17522628,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,448,"""OP you can too by moving past this""

This holds all the truth. OP, I can't speak to what you're wife's true intentions are for leaving initially or coming back now, and I don't really think anyone can. It's all speculation.

What I can speak to you about with certainty is your future. When I met my boyfriend he was in the exact same situation as you. He had married his girlfriend of 5 years, and was truly in love. Believed she was the one.  He bought her a nice home, continued to climb the ladder at work because he wanted to provide for her and grow their family. He helped her on her weight loss journey over the years and completely changed her life. Then she left him, for all these reasons.

When we met he was in your shoes. Heartbroken, lonely, confused. We became friends and eventually started talking. We had THE MOST fun together and it was really magical. Wasn't long after we started dating that she came back. She said that she made a huge mistake and missed their life together. She started moving her things back into his house while he was gone. She hung up all their wedding photos while he was at work. So I backed off and gave him space while he figured himself out.

He decided that now he needed time too, and rejected her. We've been together ever since (about a year and a half).

I'll save you all the details of my insane, soap opera-esq breakups (but believe me, they were really fucking bad lol). But I want you to know that we're not just happy together, were so in love, and it's the healthiest relationship either of us have ever been in. He tells me all the time that I've shown him a whole new way to live. We take care of eachother, support eachother, and heal eachother. 

Point being - I know breakups are hard. Heartbreak is the worst thing in the world. But there are over 7 billion people in this world, and we're capable of loving deeply many times. There isn't just one person for us. She probably did you a favor because now you also have the opportunity to explore your life and find someone that will show you new things and you won't have to question if their motives are pure.

Just know that there are other people out there for you to build something beautiful with. If you turn her away, you're not dooming yourself to a lifetime of loneliness. You sound like a good man. Someone will snag you up and be forever grateful that you're in their life."
rel_973337,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,102,"Don't talk to your friend until you and her are sure that a relationship is what you want and it looks like things could take off. Obviously you don't want to kick that wasp nest over a nonstarter. 

When you do talk to him, I would frame it less as an apology and more as a notification. You're doing him a courtesy and recognising a potential awkwardness but at the same time you don't want to put him in the position of having to give you his blessing nor do you want to give him veto power over the relationship. 

Good luck "
rel_2720871,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,229,"I asked you all those questions so you could flesh things out. Which you have done pretty well, so thank you for that.

In my opinion, it seems that you have some issues that are far more deep than 'my husband wants to take a 4 month vacation.' I'm seeing resentment, lack of trust, fear, and lack of *effective* communication to name a few. None of which I can help you with over a keyboard.

Another thing I am seeing is that it is very easy for you to list your husband's many faults, in a pretty informative way. However, when it comes to listing your faults, it becomes vague. That is, unless your faults are literally just being on the computer a lot and sporadic bitchiness. At that point, I'd say you would be as close to perfect as a human can be as far as a living partner goes.

At the end of the day OP, **what do you want?** Are you trying to rebuild the trust? Are you staying together for the kids? Are you trying to get your relationship back the way it was (an impossible task since it has already changed)? Are you trying to build something new? Are you trying to be successful? Are you just trying to be happy?

What do you want from yourself, from your marriage, and from your husband?"
rel_29738000,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,165,"Just try to be self aware about how this situation is affecting you. It's not for everyone, and even those who do have ex's that remain friends with it wont be universal to every ex. If it's taking too much out of you then you'll need to break contact. There's no shame in that.

If I'm honest I think that's the direction you will need to head down. You still have feelings for her and they don't seem mutual. You will probably have to watch her form new relationships and staying in contact will make it take longer for you to move on. It'll be hard.

My advice if you're looking for a compromise between staying friends or not would be to break contact for awhile. Talk to her and set a date to get back in touch, like in six months or more to catch up. Give yourself the space you need to move on easily without cutting her out of your life forever."

Not all men are like this but there are men out there who deliberately try to take advantage of women, emotionally and physically. Some just think it’s ok to berate women and don’t see them as equal human beings. You deserve respect but that doesn’t mean people are going to automatically give it to you because some people just suck. Just know it’s not your fault at all. Please even if it’s happened multiple times. Maybe you’re just a passive person or quiet whatever. Still, be strong on the notion that being treated like that is not ok. It’s ok to stand up for yourself. You should. There’s always a nice(r) way to be assertive. Sounds like your husband was trying to have your back, if its to a stranger maybe it doesn’t matter all that much if he announces he’s your husband or not although I know how you feel but seriously that guy might take it more seriously if he doesn’t know it’s from your husband who would be naturally protective and think it’s just from a male bystander. Hopefully he’ll be hesitant to do that again to you or someone else if he thinks other men will call him out. Thank him for the effort for positive reinforcement, you can always suggest in the future if you would appreciate he mention he’s your SO. Having a calm conversation usually works best with my interactions with men. Good luck girl, abuse is never your fault. Some women/people can be prone too it if they appear to have weak boundaries or will not speak up against it.

Also I could see how these attacks can make you feel like killing yourself. Don’t. See therapy or research online about trauma or assault which you’ve clearly experienced! You’re stronger than you think, capitalize on that! Don’t succumb to your injuries. Focus on learning to cope with your emotions even though the actions were out of your control. You have so much to live for that you don’t even know about. Keep up with your beautiful art!!"
rel_2761627,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,156,"&gt;I feel it was 100% mutual because I have met the girl before and she admitted to me she doesn't need much support, just someone to ensure she's safe at night time due to issues relating to self harm and such.

Ahem, a woman that is enrolled in a program in order to feel safe at night and so she doesn't hurt herself is an extremely vulnerable person. Even if the sex was still *legally* consensual, he still abused the trust of a person under his care and may have caused her a great deal of emotional damage.

You also have no way of knowing whether or not this is first rodeo... it just might be the first time you caught him.

fast forward to TWENTY YEARS later, we are still friends haha! one day i asked him so how was that prostitute in Amsterdam anyways?? guess what he says!!! he actually couldn't get it up and they never had sex they just talked, he was to scared of contracting an STD!!! what the hell man...

moral of the story tho is when someone breaks your trust (me snooping, him cheating) the relationship is damaged... both parties have to really want to make things work after... but if a break up happens everyone survives and maybe become friends after... im thankful for that break up tho because i had such wonderful boyfriends after him...

There’s a lot of stuff to decompress in this post but to me this is the red flag of all red flags.

If you marry, that person needs to be the most important person in your life and you need to be the most important person in theirs. So the statement that you will never come before him (even said in anger or frustration) is not okay. 

Your family is always important but you’re not gonna share a bed or a home with your parents or siblings the rest of your lives. You won’t be making decisions with them, raising a child with them. You’ll be doing that with your spouse. If you’re not a priority in his life right now, after 8 years and with stable income, then when?

rel_17300999,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,288,"If you don’t have any adult friends you talk to on a regular basis, it seems like he might be trying to isolate you from your family...? As others have said, you aren’t doing anything that even reaches the level of mild annoyance for anyone with common decency. You should be able to talk to your little sister 20-30 mins a day if you really wanted to, and he shouldn’t have shit to say about it. 

I have a brother 20 years older than me, and we’ve never been that close. This is partially due to the fact that he had a kid when I was 3, and she’s more of a sibling to me than him but I barely speak to her these days. My bf of 2 years has literally encouraged me to reach out to her more often. She recently had a zoom ceremony for her undergrad nursing program with at least 50 kids and all their fam in attendance. My mom told me about this ceremony literally 2 hours prior to it starting, but bf was all about jumping on and cheered as loudly as my dad did. My bf and I aren’t even particularly close to most members of our respective families, but I’ve done similar things for his fam over quarantine.  

It’s completely understandable that you’d put extra effort into fostering a relationship with a sibling who was 5 years old when you left home and probably could really use your support right now. I can’t even begin to understand why this is an issue in your relationship, you need to sit him down and ask why he feels this way. It’s beyond childish and is truly appalling behavior for an adult."

She can yell at you without consequences and don't need to pay for anything or show that she wants to be with you in the long run.

A fact is if she treats you like this is because you're letting her. Put your foot down with things you're not comfortable with, don't let her disrespect you. If she thinks you're being abusive and you disagree, she can either accept and work with it or leave. Same goes for you.

Discuss the relationship, expectations and what is acceptable or not, tell her you think she should help with the bills, ask how much she is confortable chipping in (if she makes less money than you, maybe you two can chip in the same percentage of salary and not same amount of money. Again it's a partnership not a charity.

But most important, reflect if that is the kind of relationship you want to have on the long run. I know this post is just a frame in the video of your relationship and she can actually be a nice person.

Clear requirements, like “I need to get flowers on these days, I know you think it’s silly but it’s meaningful to me and I am asking you to do this.” It’s okay to actually say “This is a need for me that I’m asking you to do for my happiness.” Or “I love you and at the same time I’m not looking to discuss, I’m telling you that this is a requirement.” Feel free to literally tell him that it’s pretty fucking simple — you need flowers on certain days and that’s that. 

Make him see how working on your relationship has benefits for him, too. Make him discuss both of your love languages and talk about the concrete things that fall into each category for you both (ie maybe one of your love languages is gifts, and flowers falls into that as an action item for him). 

Tell him straight up that it is simply not okay that he isn’t getting you gifts, because girl that is just mean and disrespectful and he needs to step up on that immediately. Again feel free to tell him that by not getting you gifts or showing appreciation, he is teaching his kids by example to be ungrateful, ungracious, and cold to their loved ones.

But you don't have the time to invest in a relationship and you're unwilling to create a shared existence together. 

You will have basically 2-4 hours a day that you somehow have to cram a commute, eating, showering, winding up and down and you want to have your own space in to which to do that in - so what room is there for him in any of this? On top of that you two have completely incompatible ideas of what to make of your life. It seems that you want to be a leader in your field, but he wants to make you a housewife. There's no way of negotiating around that.

rel_27842429,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,269,"I got married at 20. I’m 40 now and we’re about to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. He’s a year older than me and we were also high school sweethearts. We’re not religious fundamentalists. There wasn’t a pregnancy scare. We didn’t get married for any reason other than that we loved each other and wanted to be married. 

Here’s my advice: wait to have kids. Go to college. Get some work experience. Do young people things like parties and concerts. And travel! Your life doesn’t need to end just because you’re married. You can grow old together while growing up together. But don’t become dependent on your husband for money, happiness, friendship. You still need to be your own person. It is possible to be your own person while still being married. 

My own marriage has worked because of the above advice. He and I both finished college and then got advanced degrees. We started careers. We travelled the world. And then we had kids. We’ve got 3 amazing kids right now and I was able to be a SAHM for over 10 years. I’m back in the workforce now and my husband has been supportive and encouraging in every life change we’ve decided on together. 

He and I each have hobbies we enjoy, both together and apart. We have mutual “couple” friends, but we also maintain individual friendships. What I’m saying is we share a lot but we’re still our own people. It’s all about balance.

To clarify, my girlfriend spend about 90% of our time free time together. The only time we are separated is when I go to the gym or see my parents.

I walk the dog with her, only inside as he is afraid of snow and cold weather at the moment.

I feed the dog a little less than her, as I give push for her to do it since I read it builds a stronger bond (and she is absolutely in love with the dog)

Responsibilities for the puppy is playing with it, cleaning up after it does its business. I generally play less compared to my girlfriend, and we evenly clean up after the puppy. She does a majority of combing, washing and teeth brushing, but I will often help hold him for those.

I feel it wasn't a breakdown, more of just upsetting. I wasn't on the floor dying but I just felt kind of helpless in taking care of the dog, like I couldn't make it happy.

I see her point of view, but I feel like ending our relationship because I was frustrated once is a bit of an unnecessary nuclear option. It's not like I beat the puppy or mistreat it, and I take care of the puppy when she is cooking or busy in the house.

I was thinking maybe it just was shocked to be alone with me of all people? It's usually around 2+ people at all times.

Hope that helps you and others with any advice, thank you."
rel_17110570,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,148,"You leave her and let her grow some self-love and self respect. I had to read some of your comments to understand why you won’t leave her. You don’t actually love her - someday, you’ll find someone you’ll love inside and out, enjoy being with at any time. You just love the idea of being there for someone who has no one else there for her. For yourself, you are sacrificing your own satisfaction to make her happy. For her, you’re holding her back from someone who would love her inside and out, and from her to grow and learn from her fear.

 Most long-term couples that don’t work out have told themselves they’ll love each other forever. And guess what? Things change. Making people sad is inevitable in life, purposefully or not. Either you sacrifice your happiness or be real and let them get over it sooner."

rel_2481026,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,345,"&gt; I don't particularly like being involved in these mind games with a coworker and our rings either.

Then stop playing mind games.  Stop switching your ring.  Stop flirting.  Stop letting yourself indulge in this little fantasy.

You've come in here with the same attitude every cheating partner has.  *""Oh, reddit, I just can't help it!  I don't know what came over me!  It just happened!""  And when told to stop, you act as though there are only two possible states for a relationship to be in:

1) Blissful perfection, or  
2) About to cheat.

It's like saying ""Oh, I didn't mean to steal that car, I just didn't want to take the bus again!""  

You know you're playing games.  You're doing it on purpose - nobody is holding a gun to your head or mind controlling you.  You're not mentally ill or suffer some compulsive ring-switching disorder.

You were attracted to someone else and decided to act on it.

You only have two decent choices:  Stop what you're doing and fix your relationship, or leave your fiance.  Every other choice makes you a cheating scumbag.  

Let me be very clear:  The problem is not that you were attracted to someone else.  That happens to every single person with a working libido.  The problem is what you chose to do with that attraction.  The problem is also that you are now claiming that you're somehow an innocent, wronged angel in all of this, as though ""feeling guilty"" is enough to actually absolve you of guilt.

""Feeling really bad about it"" doesn't actually fix or do anything.  It's sure easier than fixing things, though.

You already know how to fix things.  You just came here hoping for some encouragement and moral support and ""oh, sweetie, you're just a flawed human, and so long as you're *reeeeally* sorry, nobody will be hurt or mad!""  Fuck that.

You're in this mess yourself and it's going to be a painful fix no matter what you do.  Suck it up and fix it.  You're not going to find sympathy here."

rel_36113390,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,232,"It totally depends on the relationship and the agreement. 50/50 is always a reasonable trade, but if you're committed partners it also doesn't make sense for one half of a relationship to unnecessarily suffer when the other person is more than capable of taking on more without badly affecting their own wallet. It's also fair to say that if you're both working equally hard and have decided to be PARTNERS in life that equity trumps equality so that you can both be happy TOGETHER. It's also fair to say that if one person doesn't work that much and there's been no arrangement for the other to help support them that it's less fair in newer relationships to expect that. But also, not everyone gets married so at what point do you decide to be a financial team as well? I'm speaking from the experience of a person raised by two equally working parents, one who made a lot more than the other and always had room for play while my other parent in the married relationship would have to ask for help to get a new shirt for work, etc, which was hardly fair considering they were in fact married and paying equally for anything and there became a power dynamic that was entirely toxic and borderline abusive, so my lens comes a bit from that, rather than from seeing normal relationships."

Somehow it makes me more drunk or at least awake enough to notice being buzzed. I get another beer and now I feel strange. I get some water and ask her for another coffee which she brings out lightning quick. She said she was expecting it so she told the kitchen to have it ready. Her boyfriend shows up.

rel_23518488,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,130,"&gt; If you're committed to one another and committed to your family, what's some words, a piece of paper and some gold going to change? Absolutely nothing.

On one level, you're right -- it's quite possible for a couple to have a long, faithful relationship and raise a family together without ever getting married.  And that's a quite-workable choice, as long as those terms were understood from the very start.  But, in this case, the entire relationship was predicated on him promising to eventually marry her, which it now seems obvious was a lie on his part.  That isn't a ""commitment to one another"" in the sense you mention above; it's a case of one partner deceiving the other for their own selfish benefit.  And that's a *very* different matter."
rel_37724717,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,176,"I had a bf tell me after he went to a conference, and after I moved to a different state for him, that he met a guy who had a practice in Spain he could join. I was like well it was a big thing for me to move “here”, not sure about Spain. His response was, “I didn’t plan on you going”. That’s when I realized I was in relationship by myself. If he is making life plans without you, especially if you already live together, then he doesn’t plan on continuing the relationship. 

If you want to break up then do it. When he’s gone pack his stuff, change the locks, and put it out on the porch for him to take. If he wont leave, contact the police. Or if you have a friend you could stay with, go there. Maybe if it’s just you temporarily, a friend might be more willing. Then leave him in the hoarding situation.

rel_35563454,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,238,"Well, it depends.    
What you want? Do you want to give it a shot? Do you like her? Because, now she’s obviously an adult and no more your student—I don’t see anything wrong with dating her.    

The only thing is, I, as a (21 f) think she’s just having a crush on you for years, like she said it herself—that she “thought” it was just a crush. But she probably have been having you on her Facebook for some time, and hell, does that cause old feelings (or hormones) to boil up again!    

So, in my opinion (cause I also went through the same or similar things way too many times when I was younger—having intense “daddy issues” after my parents divorced when I was 11, and then my dad passed away when I was fifteen)—it is quite improbable and can hardly be love-love, if you know what I’m saying. Which makes it more likely to just be a waste of time and energy for you and a scar for her if it doesn’t work out.   

Yet, it’s so smart, wise and brave of her to confess her feelings (wrong or right, true or untrue) to you—saying she fears she’ll regret it! :)     

No many people do this and yes; they end up “regretting it for the rest of their lives”.

Or maybe she just wanted certain people there, when in labour you need support its about mum and bub not nurses, not you, not the grocery store checkout person who serves you wrong three days prior. It's about mum and bub! 

When in labour your head isn't clear and your body takes over, you solely focus on the process or labour. (I'm a mum of 4) especially when your in preterm labour, and your first labour. It's all new and scary the nurses try telling you rhe process of how they'll need to take baby, or baby could need extra support any mum finds this confronting, my 4th baby was rushed away born at 36w I was terrified (my partner wasn't there either, coz he was sick)

Maybe she told her parents to call you and they talked her out if it or just didn't, you did say they hate you...

rel_24259329,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,279,"Boundaries boundaries boundaries! I promise you one of the biggest lessons you’ll learn in life is if someone tells you who they are or what they’re going to do, believe them. She is going to take the attention from your wedding day, and I’m telling you right now it is NOT going to be in a subtle manner.  If you’re willing to look back in 30 years and be okay with very few of your own wedding photos and more gender reveal photos, or realizing you planned an entire day for someone that’s probably not even in your life anymore or someone that isn’t living up life with or for you, then by all means go for it. But I have a feeling that’s not the case. You need to uninvite her. Trust me, and be real with yourself, would you rather deal with a little petty drama while you’re young, or would you prefer to regret for literally the rest of your life having dedicated the day that you and your partner deserved to someone who isn’t going to be a part of your life for all that long anyways? Oh, and she will wear that wedding dress. Even if they disguise it with a humorous tone, believe people when they tell you they will do something. Your friend is living in a façade to cope with her identity issues, and inviting her to your wedding is only going to encourage her to further inconvenience people and be unapologetically inconsiderate, AND it will worsen in her behavior if you enable her as she’s seeing she can get whatever she wants, however she wants, and not face any consequences."

rel_38386086,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,297,"&gt; You keep mentioning stages of relationships but then saying that they're just dating after THREE years.

Stages are not time.  Stages are by the level of respect and acceptance of making big life moves together.  Some people go 10 years without getting to that point.  Three years is nothing if they aren't at the respect stage.  

And he isn't.  He directly showed he isn't there.  

His actions are based on a lack of human respect.  His actions show why it was a good idea to wait on personal info, but isn't the basis for it.  The lack of respect is.  

&gt; Youre just twisting the situation to fit your narrative.

Is it basic English you have an issue with or just complex concepts?  He has shown her lack of human respect for a while.  Their relationship wasn't past the initial dating stage.  They haven't had life goal discussions working together on action plans.  

His actions aren't the *reason* to hold back.  They highlight the *outcome* of why you hold back.  The lack of respect is the reason.  And respect is needed for the next stage.  The actions he took based on the lack of respect highlight why he wasn't a good person.   The actions came later.  The lack of respect was evident from the start.  

OP did not owe someone that wasn't at that stage her personal medical info.  She gave the info he needed to show he respected.  If he had respected it then they could have moved forward.  He didn't.  

Three years is in the grand scheme of dating pretty damn short.  Highlighted by how little he cared about her if he was willing to sexually assault her.   Stop trying to pretend like 3 years is some amazing length of time.  It's really not."
rel_16690047,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,298,"OK, I know this is hard, but you are not responsible for your friend's mental health. You need to start to separate yourself from her - you are too enmeshed and co-dependent. You can do your best to encourage her to seek treatment (which it sounds like she should do, and she should be responsible for her own mental health, and not her mother's or sister's!). 

Healthy relationships have give and take. It sounds like (due to her own trauma), your girlfriend is 95% take, 5% give. What are you really getting out of it? She is holding you hostage to her trauma, making it yours to manage and worry about it. That is co-dependence. 

(As an aside...I don't quite understand what you mean by ""leaving."" If you're living together I think she or you should should leave. If it means just ""leaving the relationship,"" I think you can turn down the heat on the friendship and be supportive but more distant. Don't be on call 24/7 to solve her problems. )

Look to your own needs, and what you want. If you want to try to make it work with your boyfriend, think about the give and take of that relationship. What will it take from you to build trust? What kind of person do you want to be, with him? Does he love and support you equally to the way you love and support him? Once you look inside yourself, maybe you'll realize you're not emotionally ready to be in this relationship with the boyfriend. Or maybe you are. But if you keep cleaning up the messes of your ex-girlfriend, you will never be ready to focus on your own needs and have a healthy relationship with someone else.

Good luck - take care of yourself."

If he made up same lame ass excuse  but instead he cared more about fixing his affair then the relationship with you. Don’t waste your time with someone like him. He’s shown his true colors. 

The best thing for you right now is to focus on you, your daughter, and your future son. These are the most important people that you need to put first.

I guess it just bothers me that after 3 years, he's fine with talking about our hypothetical future, but he gets weird when it comes to saying for sure what he wants for our future. I've known for over a year now that I 100% want to marry him and would say yes as soon as he asks. I just dont know if I should be concerned that after 3 years, he still can't say (or hasn't said, at least) that he knows that he wants to marry me. Maybe my views are skewed because no one in my family has ever went to college, and they all married fairly young and after 1-3 years of dating. 

I don't need a proposal to feel secure, but I would feel more comfortable hearing him say that he knows he wants to marry me in the future, if that makes sense. We won't be in a position to get married for probably 5 more years, but I need to know that I'm not just a girlfriend that he's still testing out and deciding on for 8 years before he is sure.

The amount of PIED? Or how about the amount of men who started using porn, but then went on to sexually assault women? Men who had to start watching more and more intense porn just to get off because the studies do, in fact, prove that porn is the same as any other drug and becomes less exciting and less stimulating overtime because it’s negatively impacting your dopamine receptors? The link between porn and depression? The amount of women who were raped for porn videos and those videos got to the front page of big porn sites and weren’t taken down despite multiple requests so millions of men were jerking to them? The fact some of the top porn genres are BARELY LEGAL and JUST 18 because men who watch porn tend to lean towards pedophilia as that’s what’s pushed?

we BPDs are hard to deal with , hot and cold , everyday is a new day in our head and we switch our moods constantly but we have NO POWER OVER IT , unless medicated - it´s a constant shitshow about raging feelings and utter hopelesness drifting into giving up everything we know. now imagine this goes on and on everyday and we are lucky to find a time or day to enjoy things.

also it´s a shit excuse to see someone or date someone else because of this , i´ve 0 interest in other women eversince i´ve met her i do not chat or phone other women AT ALL. NONE , 0 Niente , nada!

What you can do is constant talking and being open about it no matter the outcome , he will appreciate it a lot and stress the fact that he is yours , yours only and you want nobody else. as childish and stupid it may sound he will need constant confirmation about the fact that it is him you want to be with , that is if you do .... i probably didn´t make a lot of sense or maybe i ignited something in you that i didn´t intend to , another part of this chemical brain imbalance that makes it hard to sort feelings facts and wishes from another 24/7.
There is none , NO excuse to cheat or see someone else no matter what you are going through in life with someone. Keep that in mind. Confront the other woman in his life and come clean. You won´t be able to heal otherwise imho."

I understand you’re young and everyone is doing their life. This situation was brought upon you with no choice, please try not be bitter. While I can see why you would, everyone else would probably never face your situation. And those who have would say and feel what you’re expressing I’m sure.
Trying to cope with loss and being a parent to a sibling and having you life changed so quickly and by traumatic events.

Talk to your family friends. See if you can both go there. Maybe it won’t work and maybe it will. Maybe it will work for a short time not a long time.

Do what you need to do. You need some support from someone outside of this. Maybe a family meeting with a therapist would be a great help. 

Hang in there, you’re doing the best you can do. You’re incredibly brave and I admire what you’re doing."
rel_34488160,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,267,"The only person I have vented to about my husband or relationship with him was my therapist.

With friends and family.... I paint my husband in the best light as possible. Only a handful of times I've spoken to ONE very close cousin about something I needed feedback on, in fact, I actually only recall one time when I called her crying and she was genuinely surprised, too.

Whether you merely vent on whatever frequency, it's the fact that you feel the need to do so. Not many women appreciate having their male partners confide to another woman on a regular basis.

Btw, in case you are unaware, this is how affairs start. They start with the occasional venting. Then a familiarity brews between the the ""venter"" (yes, it I'm aware that's not a word) and the listener. Affinity builds and thus starts the emotional affair. A physical affair is not far behind as boundaries are inappropriately pushed.

I'm saying you will have an affair with the specific female friends you have now, but you could be putting up red flags that the women you've been seeing likely don't feel like they'll be a priority in your life. When you're married this is crucial. Transparency in a relationship is also crucial to build trust.

No one is saying you can't have female friends, we're trying to let you know that in some way your relationships with these women are throwing up red flags to potential life partners and you need to take a hard *honest* look at yourself, your actions, words, and how you handle these relationships."
rel_20390056,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,233,"I feel for you. You moved in with a man you love and his daughter who you adore, but it sounds like you underestimated the imbalance of power.

He controls the money _and_ makes all the rules in the house. By keeping you so busy, he is effectively hindering you from oursuing your education.

Do you remember when Cinderella wanted to go to the ball, but the evil controlling parental figure gave her so much work, it would take a miracle for her to complete it and still pursue her dream? They never planned on letting her pursue the dream. They just let her believe it was within her power. 

Fast forward from your current situation a bit- what is your future there? Will your BF allow you to go to work once your education is complete, who will be looking after house and child then? What if you get pregnant, will you be allowed to make rules for your own child, or will that also be his remit entirely? If he sais you're not earning your keep now that you're giving him free, almost full-time labour, how much of your paycheck is he going to want as your part of the expenses?

You are being exploited in that house, and it's really not okay. You NEED to get out of this dependence- can you move in with your parents in the interim?"
rel_14413937,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,269,"This is heartbreaking, but it sounds like you know the source of her resentment, which could be helpful. I don't think you should move towards divorce just yet. It's likely she was just venting to a friend, but doesn't actually feel this way. (Although her friend was out of line. There are ways of sympathizing without reinforcing your friend's worst thoughts and impulses.)

There's not a lot of background information in your post, but I wouldn't assume that she's feeling this way just because of your weight. You said she's berated you about it a lot in the past. I would bet that her frustration is because of something deeper than appearances. Do you think you've given her a sense that you're apathetic to your health, her feelings, your relationship? If she's tried to talk to you about these issues and you haven't made any effort to change or demonstrate that you understand and care, then she might feel like you've already decided to emotionally abandon the relationship. Maybe she feels like she has to be your mother instead of your wife and feels drained or unappreciated.

I don't want to dismiss or minimize her comments: they are not normal, and are evidence of real inner torment. You should both consider counseling - probably individually and as a couple. But first you have to both give each other confidence that you want to work through this. If she thinks that you've already given up, then you should be the first to change her mind. 

So sorry for all the hurt you're feeling. Wish you both the best of luck."
rel_4503640,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,100,"True, the pressure being internal is key, but it's the partner who starts the internal pressure. It also important both people meet in the middle, otherwise it's just not a compromise. 

Saying ""have sex with me or I'm leaving"" or ""compromise and have sex with me or I'm leaving"" provides the same ultimatum though. That's what I see anyway, which is why dislike this notion.

It seems we agree with each other and are just argueing semantics at this point. I think we clearly both mean well and endorse open communication within relationships, that's the main thing to take away."
rel_10818637,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,131,"Some people need to have a partner of the same religion &amp; same strength in faith. I commend you for not letting that be a factor for breaking up &amp; instead accepting her. However I think it’s selfish &amp; unreasonable to ask someone to convert or become more religious when they really don’t want to, like you. My advice is not to compromise your personal comfort or literal thought process for anybody. If she’s gonna be firm in her beliefs, so should you. Don’t force yourself to believe something you don’t. It’s good she was up front with you &amp; said she doesn’t want to hurt you. Obviously she has a big heart but truthfully there’s lots of women with big hearts that won’t ask you to change your fundamental beliefs."

My husband who I had been married to for nearly 7 years suddenly walked out on me and my son (6 at the time). It was devastating for my son and,  so when my husband said he had made a mistake and wanted to come back a few months later, it seemed like the right thing to let him come home.  Especially because of how hard it had been on my son.  It's been 4 years since then and my husband has decided 3 times that he doesn't love me anymore and wants to leave... and it feels like a never ending cycle, I always tell myself next time I won't let him come back,  and then I do because of my son,  because it's hard.  If I can just leave you with one piece of advice I would say that I wish I had been strong enough to say no the first time he asked to come home.  You don't have to be together to give your child a good home,  I have sacrificed happiness for years because I thought I needed to keep my husband around for my son.

The point that you keep missing is that it’s actually quite common for people to have their own accounts and have a possible joint account for shared household expenses. But you don’t actually need to necessarily have access or know about the other person’s full finances. It’s not the 1970s. Yes, knowing your spouses’ financial position is important (debt, savings, etc), but people don’t need to join finances anymore. I say all that to say instead of her losing it, she should have discussed what made her uncomfortable instead of telling OP that he should not share HIS OWN financial information with his mother - and forced a boundary on him that he doesn’t actually have to keep! He’s not disclosing her financial info, he is disclosing HIS!

P.s. you do realize that just bc she’s his wife does not mean that she is owed any money that he makes. He could literally leave her nothing if he died and he’s legally entitled to do that. 

Anyways, that’s all for me. Good day 🙃"

rel_35083354,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,286,"When I was in high school I was bullied by a girl that was suppose to be my friend. I’ll spare the details but the first major time she bullied me she spread rumors about me, and turned the entire school against me (small school). She tried to do it again three times after that over the course of two years with no success. I still remained friends with her on and off to the dismay of my actual friends who cared about me and my family. Finally one day a year later after we graduated I pretty much was like “oh yeah this sucks fuck this I’m out” and went no contact on a whim. She will try to reach out from time to time with texting me about a boy, and last year even called me at 3 am asking me to call her, I blocked that number so fast. It’s easy to fall back into bad habits, I didn’t like the person I was when I was around her I wasn’t myself and there’s plenty of people out there that are for you and you can be yourself with. This person is not worth your time, I understand the trauma she caused you and that will take more time to heal. One of the best ways to heal though would be not to look back and leave her in the past. It doesn’t matter if “you’re doing better” you’re still on the same level as her if you’re infatuated with doing better than her.

rel_22250026,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,221,"Fellow husband of a woman with mental health history here (bipolar disorder, narcissism disorder, depression).

It certainly appears your wife has had some sort of mental health “break”. The paranoia, the cutting off of relationships, the berating and threatening coming out of nowhere — they all point to something disordered in her brain. 

Is she on any medications AT ALL? 

If so, I strongly recommend you immediately review literature for those meds. It is not uncommon for medications to have psychoactive impacts. 

If not, it is also quite possible that the pandemic itself has driven her over the edge. 

In some people, the extreme stressors from events like the pandemic and it’s impacts on daily life routines can cause chemical changes to the brain that can trigger or exacerbate mental health issues. 

I would strongly recommend sitting her down when she is in one of her good moods, and telling her how concerned you are. Recount the list of specific behaviors and how they are unlike anything you have ever seen from her. Ask to join her at her therapist, so you can share what you are observing. Hell, it is always possible this therapist IS the cause of all this. 

Good luck , and PM me f you need any other advice from a veteran of the mental health wars."

OP, you need to wash your hands of this attempt to get advice here. This is the most insidious brigade I’ve seen on this site. There are *never* this many whacked-out, passive-aggressive incels in this sub, and they’re doing a really good job of gaslighting the hell out of you. You’ve just been dumped, you’re emotionally vulnerable, and this group is going to derange you into self-loathing. 

Just look; nobody is even listening to you. They’re hellbent that you’re some kind of walking, marital bear-trap that’s all cracked-out with baby-rabies, and a lust for men’s paychecks. 

Regardless of whatever performance art is happening in here: I’m sorry you lost your boyfriend to this bullshit. Yes, he is being stupid. You might think he’s a genius and in other respects, maybe he is. We all have our blind spots, and as you can see here the acolytes of this movement are really good at finding and exploiting them. But moving forward, you have to accept that you were dumped over something stupid. You can’t fix it, you can’t fix him, and chances are he’s going to become a much worse person as time progresses. These people are what you call “crabs in a bucket,” meaning they could escape their shitty situation if they work together, but instead they just struggle to pull each other further down into it.

You have a decision to make. You deserve to be treated with basic human dignity. Having a fetish doesn't excuse his behavior. Do you really want to put up with this?

rel_1512800,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,384,"Hmm... that is a strange find you made!  My advice will just be preliminary: be careful of anyone giving you extreme advice to immediately leave him or just totally forget about it.  If he is *genuinely* becoming a better person, not just doing a few token external things, then stay on.  Especially if he is someone having real internal change and more light shining in his eyes.  Hard truth: sometimes even guys who are truly improving still make little mistakes.  I was genuinely improving once with one of my first girlfriends, but did something with a webcam that lost her forever.  A year or two later I had become the pure-hearted and loving guy I wanted to become.  I don't blame her for leaving, but I really had been working on myself... just still stumbled once in a while.   ~~~ Anyway, I would just mainly react right now by filing this away in your mind carefully.  First spend some time thoroughly reviewing the incident--like a meditation-level re-thinking of the moment you told him about the box.  What did the little ticks in his face say?  How afraid was he?  Was the explanation he gave truly honest and embarrassed?  Or was it full of stupefied fear?  Ask him if there is anything else he'd like to tell you now before you find out on your own.  Tell him you'll be a lot more understanding of anything you find out through him than find out on your own.  Then, resolve in yourself what your red-lines are if you find anything else freaky and stick to them!  Tell him that you believe him, but it has raised a caution flag within you that will only go away if he stays true.  But, if you see him kiss another girl or find even one chain of suspicious texts... then this might be like an iceberg where you've only seen on accident the tip of his cheating/deviant behavior.  Remember: many partners are cheated on very badly for very long periods of time before they even suspect a thing, so a pattern of bad behavior and shocking discoveries like a box of underwear... well, it can always have a small potential to mean something very very bad that you'd never even imagine.  That's something I sadly also know from experience. "
rel_10135428,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,346,"It tends to refer more to someone that you have to work closely with, rather than someone that you've become close friends with. For example, I worked as a field computer tech for a while and had to report everything I did to my dispatcher who was a girl the same age as me. This was a small company so she was the only dispatcher, and I was the only primary field tech (we had an in-shop service that other techs that worked in house would occasionally be sent off to pick up computers for in house repair, but I was really the only one that did actual services at the sites...it was hella stressful).

Every single day I'd have to see her in the morning to go over my schedule before heading out for the day, I had to call her when I arrived and departed to/from every site, and at the end of the day I would arrive back at the office and go over my notes with her to ensure all of my tickets were closed for the day.  This resulted in us getting really close because of course we'd end up talking about personal things often, but not only that ...we really relied on each other to make sure we both kept our jobs. I personally never referred to her as my work wife, but other coworkers definitely did.

It's a really hard dynamic to put to words, but in the end we weren't really friends outside of work (never hung out or talked to each other without work being involved)... yet we were really close. I can easily see this dynamic happening between managers and their assistants quite often.

I can't really explain why it's not the same when it's male-male or female-female, but if I had to guess I would say it might have to do with a perceived sexual tension from some party involved. In my case, I don't think either of us felt any sexual tension, but others around us might have perceived something from watching our interactions."

However, I do feel she is unhappy with the relationship. She occasionally makes sarcastic comments like "" well he changes his hair style/color every once and a while, keeps it interesting, maybe that's why I'm still with him. "" she makes it sound like there isn't much interest any more. I should preface that by saying she's been in a long term relationship. She's also made several comments that they are like best friends. To me the way she says it sounds like they are more friends than bf/gf. I know it's not cool to steal someone's Giri that's not my intensions and honestly I'm not planning on telling her anything or making a move unless she makes a move first or there is 100% sure of sign that she wants me to. I also hate wasting my time so I wouldn't say I'm obsessing or anything like that. Basically if I don't figure out soon what's going on between us, I'll move on, but still communicate.

rel_2203052,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,335,"You will get your answer on Monday. But I'll tell you now you bombed it. While he was intrigued by your desire to be in the art business (as indicated by your studies) enough to give you an interview, the answers you have made him regret it instantly. If you get the job, it will most likely be because the other candidate bombed it worse.

In the meantime, practice your answers for the hard questions. Instead of saying ""the bistro had no vacancies"", which implies ""I just want a job and this place is option 3, I'm only here because nobody else will hire me"", say ""I considered going back there, I really did enjoy interacting with the customers, but Art and Design is my passion, it's what I'm studying in school, and I thought a job here would give me more exposure to it, and would be more fulfilling to me""

When asked about the lack of jobs during the summers, it's OK to make something up. ""My Grandfather had a stroke a few years ago. I used the past two summers to help with his housework and home maintenance so my parents could have a bit of a break since they do that, plus work their full time jobs, during the months I'm in school.  But he has recovered sufficiently enough where he is self sufficent again, which we are all thankful for, but that frees up my time to work on my own goals. It's been tough not having spare cash to help with my own bills, especially seeing my friends with newer cars and nicer clothes than I have, but I have no regrets""

Remember, ALWAYS make it seem like you want THIS job, not just A job.

And always make it look like there is a good reason you didn't work when you had opportunities.  By saying ""I tried and couldn't get a job"" you are telling the manager ""There is something wrong with me that nobody else hired me"""
rel_17999377,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,324,"no a 2 year difference isn’t a lot, *once you are at least in your 20s* but you in college are dealing with something completely different than she is in high school. you have an influence on her you may not even be aware of. 

let her be a high schooler. honestly, i don’t even know why you’d be aiming for someone younger when you can have whoever you want that’s in college and your age. i know you say you have a connection, but that alone isn’t that hard to find. you can stay friends with this girl but idk i think it’s weird if you try to pursue it romantically. 

if i were in HS, i’d be concerned if my friend/daughter was dating someone in college. as someone in college, i’d be very judgmental if my friend/son was dating someone in high school. 

this is coming from someone who was in a 3 year relationship when i was 15 and he was 17, now that i’m older, i resent him for influencing me (unintentionally) into trying to grow up too fast. i was way too worried about college things when i was in high school. i even graduated early, which i now regret. at the time if you asked me, i would have sworn up and down that “it didn’t matter” or “i was really mature for my age so it levels out”, yes i was mature for my age...but i was still only 15-16-17 when he was several years older. we broke up because he went away to college and i felt like my hs years were “robbed” of me and i didn’t really even know what my own personality was because i spent several of my developing years just infatuated with him and absorbing his personality and hobbies.

i can’t stop you, but i just think it’s in BOTH of your guys best interest to date someone who’s your age."

For OP's husband to realize how horrific his father and grandparents are and that him and his sibling aren't the result of 2 people loving each other coming together to create a family but a woman who was abused and assaulted for years being forced to have kids she didn't want and doesn't love shakes a person to their core. Every single one of her husband's relationships with his once closest family members has been either destroyed or severely altered by this news.

rel_923412,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,446,"&gt; Then the oddest thing happened. She looked up at me and told me ""I know this is wierd, but you are soo hot right now!"" ""Why, yes. Yes I am,"" I replied. I dragged her to the bedroom and hot dom/sub monkey sex ensued. 

This makes me think you are a troll, but on the off chance you aren't:

You seem to think the problem is sexual incompatibility.  That may have been your problem *before*, but that was before she decided to cheat, repeatedly, rather than try to fix that problem.

Everything else you wrote seems to be about various other issues rather than the fact that the trust in the relationship has been destroyed.

So here is my quick sheet answers:

&gt; How can I prove to her that I can change?

Honestly, she needs to first prove that she can be trusted (if possible) before you can work together to solve problems.  Her mechanism for dealing with her unhappiness wasn't communication, it was infidelity.  Unless that changes, I don't think it matters what you do.

&gt; How can she regain my trust?

I don't know.  For me, I could probably never trust her again.  This wasn't a drunken accident that she immediately regretted.  It was planned and repeated acts of infidelity that she knew were wrong but did anyways.  Maybe you can get over it, but do you honestly think that no matter what happens from now on, she would never do it again?  Really?

&gt; How can I improve my communications?

Like I said, she made the bigger mistake in this regards, but communication is a skill set like any other.  Practice communicating things, even communicating about communicating.  When it doesn't work or resolve issues, review and learn from that failure and then adjust your tactics when communicating next time.

As some quick points, you should never keep things to yourself when you are very unhappy and you should never yell or blame.  Talk about your own feelings.  Don't say ""You always do X!"", say things like ""When you do X, it makes me feel Y.""

Also, see problems not as something that comes between you, but as things you work together as a team to overcome.  Again, it isn't about determining who is to blame, it is about finding solutions to make you happier.

&gt; And my emotional connectivity?

Can't really help much about that, except to say that you shouldn't repress feelings.  Don't push away feelings you don't like.  Recognize them and think about why you are feeling this way and how you would want to feel.  In the end though, talking to a professional might help more with this."

rel_9108579,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,447,"I think the first, and most important, question you need to ask yourself is, assuming you are able to work through this, what kind of future do you see with this girl? Can you imagine yourself growing old with her? Can you imagine her being the kind of mother you want for your daughter (assuming she isn't the biological mother)? Is she good to your daughter now?

Based on what you wrote, it seems like you've already thought through the possible ways of resolving this situation, but here they are listed out, anyway:

1. Things continue on as they are.
2. You figure out how to resolve these issues on your own.
3. You go to couple's counseling.
4. You end things.

It sounds like option 1 is not an option at all. It sounds like you've tried option 2, without success. Obviously, when you try to initiate a serious talk and you sense it starting to develop into a fight, you can't control what she does, but you can control what you do. Be patient. Be clear. Try your damnedest to see things from her perspective - not just her side of the argument, but how she might interpret anything you say. Be careful with your words to avoid a misunderstanding, and constantly be aware of any misunderstanding that might have developed anyway.

If you really do see a future with this woman, couple's counseling is a great idea, but remember this: she **has** to be invested in it for it to work. Don't just tell her, ""we're going to counseling."" You don't want to be with someone who you have to force into making things better. If she's resistant to the idea, take that as a sign that your relationship isn't as important to her as it is to you. But if she is willing to go along with it, that's a great sign, and it means there's a real hope of you guys getting better.

Honestly, though, based on your wording, it sounds like you're pretty fed up with her behavior - maybe you're hoping some Internet stranger will encourage you to do what you already want to do, which is break up with her? It's possible your wording is just a means of you blowing off steam, which is totally fine, but I do encourage you to try your hardest to distance yourself from your situation, and read what you wrote as a stranger would - do the words you wrote sound like they came from someone who has any real hope - or desire - to salvage his relationship (sorry, I'm assuming you're a guy - please swap out pronouns if not)?"

rel_4550735,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,440,"Thank you! I just (about 10 mins ago) brought this topic up with her. Both of us are calm and composed, so thought this'll be the perfect moment to talk about this. When I told her that we've been fighting more and more of late, she denied it, saying we fight barely once or twice a week (which I agree with, our frequency of fighting has reduced) but we still do fight over the same things. It's a repeating pattern of triggers and abuses. I asked her about the name callings i.e. calling me a sociopath and an idiot (among other names). She said I hold on to what she says too much. She said those things when she was in a bad mood and I should understand that she didn't mean them. 

She apologised saying that she's on her period (she started 2-3 days ago) and her hormones and PMS make her irritated. She acknowledged that she tends to take her irritation out on me. She also has an exam coming up in the next 4 days and blamed it on the stress of the exam for why she acted out. All of which are valid excuses and could possibly make someone lose their cool. But the thing is, so do I. Granted that I don't have periods and don't know what PMS irritation feels like. But I do have exam and work and money stresses, but even under the worst of stresses, I would never ever take it out on her in that way. After mentioning this, she retorted saying I was 27 and have my life figured out and have a safety net of being able to make a living out of my current skill set, whereas she is 20 and still trying to figure out what to do in life. 

Point being, all her retorts make logical sense. But she always has something to blame her lashing out on. It's either PMS/Periods or exam or friends' fighting or family stresses or just a bad mood. Something or the other is always going on, and that something is always the reason for her bad behaviour, and it's never her who is responsible. Something or the other will always go on, how long am I supposed to endure?

As an attempt to breakup, I mentioned that didn't see a future for our relationship and I'm sure we're headed to a dead end. She started crying on hearing this. I couldn't get myself to continue this conversation after seeing her cry. Maybe I'll bring it up some other time. She has just about stopped crying and seems calm now. "
rel_34416385,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,269,"&gt;  I explained to him that the fact he can’t tell me something so small makes it seems like he is hiding something

But if it is so small, why do you need to know about it?  He's been open and honest about her, she's getting married so probably isnt romantically interested in him, she introduced herself to you, encouraged you (by telling you he was a good guy), and of all the messages you've seen they have all been above board.  So why does he have to let you know about every single interaction he has with another woman?  You'r ebeing very insecure and controlling.

Tiktok?  Don't assume he would not like it if you had half naked people on your tiktok. Don't assume that your ideas about porn use are whats best for him.  He is his own person and can make up his own mind about that.  The best you can do is communicate your boundaries and he gets to decide what he will and won't do.  If he won't agree with the boundaries you have, you need to find a guy that will.  So I think that breaking up with him is a good thing.  

Did you overreact?  Yes, I think that you did.  But you are also entitled to want what you want.  Don't go back to this guy though. There is no way that the two of you are compatible with respect to these issues.  You're poles apart. Find a guy that is closer to your own values and standards.  Just be aware that you are asking quite a lot by today's standards."
rel_26390978,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,374,"This is severely insecure and disrespectful behavior.  I actually sympathize with writers who tell you to take a no-compromise stand.  I write only because there IS an alternative, if you care to try it.

Long-term relationships rest on the principle that negotiation and compromise is the best thing even when you righteously feel your partner is dead wrong.  So how do we compromise on this?

Well, tell him that you have something very important to say, and you would like him to hear you out before he responds.  I'd state clearly and firmly that his accusations (humorous or not) and other invasions of your privacy are both offensive and hurtful.  That you wish to settle the matter like mature adults.

Next, he must surely see that, while one or two random moments of suspicion can be dismissed as passing impulsive outbursts, regular accusations of infidelity bring up the real possibility that the accuser is simply not coping with his suspicions, and may break up, if only for his own peace of mind.  You also could use a little peace of mind.  So you would like to propose a compromise.

I'd offer that, from this point forward, he can go right on making accusing remarks of any kind, from the most sly hints and shady jokes to the darkest accusations; he can scour any device, any app, he can open your US Mail if he likes, *so long as he pays you for the privilege*.  Then you set the price of each offense - which you may negotiate if you're feeling flexible, or not.  The money, you explain, will go into an account in your name only, and the beneficiary of that account, in the event of your death, will not be him.  However, if you two reach retirement age and are still happily married, you will make it a joint account - in other words, a retirement fund.  This gives him something to lose - without your saying another word about it - if his bad behavior drives you away.

If he doesn't accept this, and abide by it, it means that he feels that he's Senior Partner here, and doesn't have to treat you as an equal.  That, in my opinion, isn't negotiable."
rel_30944473,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,145,"Okay.

OP, take it from an adult autistic.

Get your brother to a hospital ASAP. He needs help. Get your mom to help, but in case she won’t: call the emergency number for wherever you live and tell them the things you wrote here.

Secondly, you need to warn the principal and the guidance counsellor. Ask your mom to do it if she can, but if not, tell them yourself in person or on the phone. Hopefully, they can take care of the rest.

Also, seeing as how your brother has covid, wash your hands or use sanitizer as much as humanly possible. Wear a mask as often as you can (even though it sucks) unless you’re going outside where there’s no other people. Take care of yourself too, okay?

All of this is going to be terrifying but it’s so, so important. Good luck."
rel_18452422,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,292,"I used to do this, so maybe this'll give you some insight:

He's reacting like a kid because he literally doesn't have another way to express himself. What he's feeling is anxiety. He doesn't want to talk about it, and instead of facing it like a grown up, he's regressing into a child-like attitude of ""if I don't mention it and ignore it, it doesn't exist."" The reason you feel like the mother in this is because that's the role he's putting you in. As ""the mother"" you're supposed to stop asking because you don't want to upset him, and hopefully fix the whole thing yourself.

Whether this avoidant behaviour is also present in his job search, I can't say. If yes, then his ""trying to look for jobs"" probably consists of looking at job sites until the anxiety mounts too high, then closing everything, convinced he wouldn't be hired even if he did apply. It's just too much.

You may have gathered that this is not healthy. Not for your relationship, or for him personally. This is anxiety. Not necessarily a disorder, but an unhealthy way of coping with it, and it's definitely limiting his ability to live a normal adult life.

Sometimes just addressing and naming the feeling, anxiety, and talking about that can shake something loose. Sometimes medication or therapy is needed to get to a normal level of functioning. Some people just find someone to do all the hard bits for them, like a parent.

I'm not giving advice on what you should do about your relationship. That's a judgement best left to you. I know I was rough to live with back when I had this problem. An equal partner shouldn't be forced to parent the other."
rel_1102690,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,329,"You're just going to have to put yourself out there online. Yes it's daunting but if you're looking to tap into a different pool of women then that's where you'll need to go.

I'll give a little advice but then a warning.

Browse the okcupid subreddit (creatively named r/okcupid ) for things to DO and NOT DO when creating your profile and interacting. They're a good resource to field any questions you might have. 

Once you do have everything set up profile-wise, you need to recognise that you get as much out of the site as you put in. Setting up the profile is one thing, but you need to be messaging women. It's tempting to finish the profile and just leave it at that. But you need to force yourself to start messaging people.

This brings me to my warning. offline, out in the world, dating and finding dates strongly favours heterosexuals.  There's lots of men (most of whom are straight), lots of women (most of whom are straight). So you do alright in finding people to potentially date. When it comes to online dating, that favour reverses. Non-straight people have the advantage of knowing that everyone they see has their sexuality listed and there's lots of gay guys for the gay guys and lesbians for the lesbians and so on.

BUT, for the heterosexual men, the odds are stacked against you. The ratio of straight and bi guys to straight and bi girls is very much against you. It's a buyers market for the women. They're few in number and they have a lot of guys to choose from. So how does that affect you? Well supply and demand. These women are constantly swamped with messages from lots of guys. You're going to struggle to have your message heard and responded to amongst all the others. 

So manage your expectations of the online scene, but I recommend you give it a go. You have nothing to lose.

We are enforcing the two rules listed above by making all titles **start with** ages/genders in the following format:

`[##X][##X]`, `[## X][## X]`, or `[##-X][##-X]` where `##` is the age and `X` is the gender (currently M, F, T, A, NB, FTM, MTF but more can be added). You can have more than two ages/genders listed, but you must have at least two **at the beginning of your title.** Here is an example:

`[34NB][88-F] We are two people in an example post`

Please resubmit with a corrected title.

rel_36000752,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,431,"Please allow me to offer a different perspective as someone who has been in her position:

My ex and I were perfect on paper. When I commit to a relationship, I’m all in and I plan for the future. He always framed everything like he was in, but his language was always ambiguous - he would make an excellent attorney - and when it finally came down to a marriage proposal, he broke it off. I was a low priority and he was hoping I would just break up with him so he wouldn’t be responsible for the break up. He said that he was obviously meant to live alone and having a partner wasn’t for him. That if he couldn’t make it work with me, he wouldn’t be able to make it work with anyone. Then he found someone else and he moved her with him - full commitment.

He was obviously not the one for me, but the thing that hurts is the deep rejection. He was rejecting me and everything I have to offer as a person. I don’t miss him, but every so often that rejection hits me in the face and I can’t help to think: What was so wrong with me that he didn’t want me?” “What did I do wrong?” “Why am I not worth the commitment?” 

Now your partner is seeing someone that said they didn’t want to married ever - easily commit to someone else and give that person everything your partner had asked for. There’s also a good chance that if they were together a long time, she contributed to all the things this new person likes. So all the work, effort, and parts of herself that she gave to make that relationship work, is being used for someone else. There may be this idea in her head that she’s not good enough or that there’s something wrong with her and that’s why she’s been thrown away and replaced. There’s also the death of the life she built with this person - he threw that away too. She might still be mourning that life while she’s building a new one. 

Being happy with you and moving on, doesn’t wash all that away. In fact, it means that she has to work through it and deal with these feelings. I’m happily married and these feelings still smack me in the face randomly while just living my life. I don’t miss my ex but he did damage to how I see myself and my worth - it takes time to get that back."
rel_8604372,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,251,"I have to disagree.  The issue here is that she no longer feels compatible with OP’s life choice.  This choice appears to be a huge part of who he is and what his goals in life are .  The fact that they have been together for 9 years means she 100% knew who he  was and what she was getting into with this relationship.   
She has every right to express her own needs and if the relationship is not working anymore for her but to say “pick your passion or me” is a shit move.  She’s essentially saying I don’t want to do this anymore but instead of walking away I’m going to make you have to choose so that you either A) say no and have to feel like this is all your fault and the relationship ending is on you or B) say yes and give up something you have been working for your whole life and that has always been a huge part of your identity.  

I went through eight years of this and believe me I know it is not easy and yes you make sacrifices but not once did I ever consider trying to make my husband choose me or it.  I understood this was very important to him and I could either do it or I couldn’t.  If the relationship was going to fail I wasn’t going to leave him with the shitty feeling that he was responsible for something we both signed up for."

1. What I meant was her and I used to date and after that we were still really close friends.

2.I definitely did do that. I blew it out of proportion and made her kinda manage my emotions. I was at my weakest but I still wish I hadn’t acted like that

3. Nah it was my sister. I was talking to her about how bad and hopeless I was feeling and how I felt awful for pushing a close friend away, and my sister took it upon herself to tell the girl about my issues and past relationship problems.

4. I wasn’t  trying to self pity as much as explain that I’ve had issues but never done anything malicious like key a car. I realize i do feel sorry for myself too much but I also told her I don’t want her to feel like she has to worry about me and manage my emotions

6. I knew she wouldn’t be jealous, it was more so , my situation with her made me very self conscious about myself and personality and I wanted advice on how to not fuck up

7. I mean yea, I still do have those feelings, that’s why I told her I think it’s best to wait til I get over them to start talking to her. But now I’m really upset that I lost out on the friendship aspect too, because I struggle with having friends"
rel_569745,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,402,"Since you mention only introducing her to your children after 6 months, how long were you into the relationship before you told her you had kids?

If its longer than a few weeks, its possible she felt trapped, since bailing because you had kids would make her a ""bad person"", but since she didn't meet them for so long, she was able to put it out of her mind that it would be a serious factor in your relationship. Then, after the 6 month mark, she meets your kids, and it all becomes real. She's filled with regret, but again feels trapped and acts nice because that's what nice people do. Meanwhile for the next 6 months the pressure is slowly mounting, and an internal battle between he unwillingness to get involved with someone who has kids and whatever affection she has for you plays out.

Can you honestly say you've never stayed with someone longer than was good for you/them?

Ending a relationship because you're not willing to be a parent is probably one of the least trivial reasons to end a relationship. Should people really get involved with a relationships when they don't give a fuck about the kids, just because they want to be with the partner? What kind of partner would that make them?

&gt;It was like God said ""here's your perfect match"" and allowed her into my life.

[Maths](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeZMIgheZro)

Also,

&gt;She simply signed-off and destroyed me in the process.

Get over yourself.

You're meant to get more resilient as you get older. If someone you were dating for only a year can ""destroy"" you, when you're old enough to have two kids, one can only presume you didn't have your shit together to begin with. Which is possibly the real reason she left you, but I don't know you, I'm just guessing.

&gt;I just can't understand why someone would leave ""the greatest love I've ever had..."" (her words) over this. 

To quote spaced:

Tim: Well, I got a letter from my girlfriend this morning three months too late explaining why she dumped me. It was full of you'll always be special and I'll always love you platitudes designed to make me feel better while simultaneously appeasing her deep seeded sense of guilt for running off with a slimy little city boy named Duane and destroying my faith in everything in the world that is good and pure.

He has a job where he doesn't do anything (plays on Facebook all day) and he's OK with that. I'm a musician (also work full time) and he's compared his computer gaming (GTA) to me playing gigs, recording and all the other stuff, which is a big part of my life. Saying I should be just as supportive of comouter games than I am of music. I said if he wanted a career in gaming fine, but he doesn't even want that. He doesn't have any desire to get out. He's quite content just eating and watching TV and playing video games and I feel like that's not really what I want with my life. Not at this stage anyways. I traveled for many years and before I met him had a pretty great social life. But he gets sad when I leave him by himself (or at least he pretends to) so I don't really know what to do.

I KNOW you REALLY don’t want to face this, but that is not going to make it go away, and time is really of the essence here.

rel_1559599,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,460,"I know where you are coming from. It is not easy but my advice is this: you are miserable because you are choosing to be. Here is what you can do about it (warning: bad english incoming): 

1. Hit the gym. Staying fit will do wonders for you and your confidence. Try something fun like Crossfit where there are 40-50% women that you can be friends with. Maybe something good will happen there.

2. Mind your looks. The only people I can think of that are ""unfuckable"" are people that do not take the most minimal attention to caress their image (they do not shower, they do not trim, they eat unhealthy food and they don't care, they use oversized grandpa's clothes, they smell... they list goes on). Is that your case? You should evaluate and fix whatever you need. The point is to produce a pleasant experience to any girl (or person... for that matter) that is near you. I'm against over-doing it (like, be obssesive with fashion clothes, pay for expensive brands etc), but you can reach a level you are comfortable with to develop your own style of clothing, cologne, looks...  Look for pictures of Jason Statham, Josep Guardiola or even Italo Zucchelli for inspiration. Baldness is not a dealbreaker.  

3. Develop a hobby. And I am not referring to videogames, board games, and similar. I'm saying hobbies that need lots of intelectual and/or physical investment on it, and force you to be outside of your fucking couch, like photography, film, writing, dancing even ""extreme sports"" like rafting or escalating, or whatever you like and feel comfortable with. Having a hobby makes you happier, and also makes you more interesting and appealing to the opposite gender. Your choice of hobby will get you near people similar to you, in personality and in interests. 

4. You are 28, so I assume you have a job. Are you happy in it? Does it enrich you besides helping you pay the bills? Is it challenging? My advice here is that you should work in whatever area you are passionate about. Not everyone agrees with this, but my opinion is that you should work in whatever makes you happier, even if it is not a ""good, stable job"" or does not provide you with ""good career in the long term"". The point of being happier at the expense of ""stable but boring jobs"" is self-fullfillment. A person who is fullfilled has automatic magnetic qualities. And of course, girls dig that. Personality is king in the game of relationships. 

I've been where you are right now in certain points in my life. These points of advice were given to me along the way, and did wonders for me. Hopefully for you too.

When you tell her, apologize with NO excuses, none of this “hormones” stuff (no matter how true that may be to you, it reads as a justification, not an explanation, and justifications have no place in genuine apologies).

You can say something like “I wish I wouldn’t have done this. I was being short sighted, neglectful, and naive and by doing that, I did you wrong. This is what your fiancé said to me. I am so sorry for my actions, and you deserve to know the truth.” Then, you dust your hands and let her decide how she wants to handle it.

So I went to a therapist and after 5 sessions told me to consider ending the relationship. Stop asking, be direct and set and end date you need to see the changes by. He helped me prepare for each conversation. 

We got to that end date I asked for the divorce. She starting throwing herself at me. It only became about sex but what is really missing was intimacy and she just didn't get it. I gave her six months to work on it and if not she will agree to the divorce. 

We will not likely not make it. What I have learned through all of this is an understanding that it is ok to ask for what you want, it is ok for them to say no. That means it is ok for you to leave.

As a woman in my 30’s I have put up with way too many things from men and made excuses for their behavior when I was younger. My best advice is if this feels bad for you then it is a boundary line for you. That is perfectly ok queen. You should never accept something that makes you feel bad.

First, be direct and tell him how it made you feel. He should respond apologetically and tell you it won’t happen again and he loves you the way you are.

I think a professional is his best shot, a therapist to help him see the pattern of his ways. Ultimately he is hurting himself, his resentment and disdain toward your parents is only harming him. Whether his feelings are valid or not, he needs help to see past the trees for his own sake. The relationship he may or not have with his mom and dad should be the least his worries.

Her dismissal of your feelings is not based in feminism; she was using feminism as an excuse for cruelty, as a way to hurt you.

Your disagreement with things she has said in the past has nothing to do with her mistreatment of you, which is why you drew a hard line and dumped her immediately.

Saying you're glad you didn't have children together is out of left field -- which means you might have had other feelings coming up; no judgment there.  You have other issues pinballing around that could use an ear, it sounds like. You were talking about something big and some dust was kicked up.  That might be part of what you're feeling.

Sometimes just fighting with another person can feel ouchie.  Empathy is great, but empathetic people can sometimes have bad boundaries and take on the hurts of others.  

It might help to find ways to set boundaries and defend yourself that don't make you feel bad.  The ""here's what you did, here is how it made me feel, here's what is going to happen"" model might work.

A friend of mine had a husband like yours. One weekend she stayed with me in another city, leaving husband in charge of their child. 

She had not been gone many hours before he called, saying he was exhausted,  it was such hard work. As she didn't know lol. By day 2 he was almost in tears from exhaustion, had to ask his mother for help.

After that weekend he became a parent, a father and a partner. 

You have enabled his behaviour until now. He knows you will step in, so why should he try? 

You need your own weekend. 2 hours is not enough. 

Giving him articles is not going to change anything, he needs learning by doing. The child is 3. 

Plan a weekend away, in a motel if necessary. The point being your husband has to take responsibility. So, no ready made dinners to make it easy for him. No running to mom to get help. He alone with the child for 2 days. 

That also means that when he blows up your phone asking for you to come home because he can't handle it, promises everything will be different from now on, you need to stay firm. Your 3 year old will survive. 

You need a partner, a coparent and the child needs a dad. He is neither at the moment and you are letting him get away with it.

rel_846617,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,266,"I agree what k3vlar80 says. She's playing games. You invited her over, and she ignores you and removes you from FB. 

It baffles me how stupid (sorry OP) the girl can be while dating you. I truly blame parents and prior relationships on why people do what they do during relationships.

Sure things started off very sexual but why not talk about it in the first place. Why not tell you that and change things together. Why is the girl's sexual body the only one that's at stake?

IMO, you should write her a letter. On how you feel. Show her your perspective. Show her how unreasonable she's being. Show her that you understand if she doesn't have the guts to end things with you, but rather play the game of not coming over and removing you from FB. FB is for the kids. And she plays the 19 year old card very well. 

She only thought of herself and didn't step outside the box at all.

TL;DR - I wish every relationship had a judge that would write tickets to people being fucking idiots and would call people out on their bullshit. Who would give perspective and tell how relationships should be handled and who is being the complete jerk. And if judges wouldn't want to represent their client (your significant other) then that shows how fucking crazy they are or if they aren't learning from their past. For example snooping vs cheating. Snooping is like a kamikaze of 1 point compared to 10 points on actually cheating and being caught. Doesn't compare at all.

Your questions are valid. If he feels you are nagging but at the same time he is unwilling to have the conversation, it's on him. He is wrong, not you. As a partner in the relationship, you have the right to know where the relationship is going, particularly after more than 3 years. Also, you are not asking if he wants to marry/have kids NOW.

Learning your lesson the first time.

Remember, the whole point of dating is to DISQUALIFY women who have bad traits, major issues, or other incompatibilities.  You must then ALSO remember those reasons and screen out other women based on what you didn't like in the past.

So about your ex.  Let me put it this way, if you go back to her, you have failed to learn from your past and your mistakes.  Basically, it's like you were learning to ride a bike, and rode it straight into a curb, and crashed hard.  But now a scant 4 months later the curb is telling you that you won't crash if you try again, so you're going to go head on again and see what happens, as if you don't know.

You can try it, but I suspect there will be issues, and you'll be unhappy knowing she slept with some other guy, and so forth.

My advice?  Never go backwards in life.  Always go forward.  BE SINGLE.  Meet another woman who is better for you.  Learn from her.  Grow and mature because of that.  Getting stuck in the past never did me any good."
rel_24766366,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,116,"I agree for the most part. Bad mouthing a child that has done nothing wrong is assholery. But I don't think not wanting to engage with kids is necessarily bad though, if they're not your kids. Like I would say hi back or give a little smile if a kid says hi to me, but I shouldn't be obligated to have a conversation or play with a kid who wants to do that if I don't feel like it. I should be able to dismiss them by responding ""I'm not up for that right now"" when they start talking or say ""go talk to/play with xyz instead"" without it being judged as being mean to kids."
rel_17687033,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,189,"Yeah, you’re totally right. Her and I have talked about this endlessly and after we got back together I told her she had to make boundaries and start standing up for herself. Things have improved slightly but I get the feeling they know she did that because I told her.

Her father has always been a red flag but i intend to marry her so I’ll likely have to deal with him for a long time.. I think if I pass up this opportunity to “man up” just like he wants me to that he’ll always think he can manipulate us.

Another annoying tidbit, her parents were never strict or tried to control her older brother at all. They’ve always only done these things to her.

I love this girl more than anything.. she doesn’t deserve this. If I have to take the heat and have the target on my back with them forever to help her, I’ll gladly do it.

I just read through your post and all your responses in this post, and I know this shit is long, but hear me out— **you need to get out of this relationship.** These are what we call **Red Flags.** And I think you *know*, deep down inside, that this is not an acceptable way to be treated. This is gaslighting, manipulative, controlling, emotionally-abusive, exhausting bullshit.

I get the gist of what you meant when you said “he said a lot of messed up stuff about things that happened to you.” That is so completely unacceptable. Of course you were deeply hurt. That’s a horrible and shitty fucking way to treat someone, especially someone he purports to love. Only a complete shit-bag would weaponize someone’s trauma against them. He’s running you down, fucking with your sense of self and self-esteem/confidence. 

Don’t let this go any further. You already know you are a badass with a big heart and awesome interests that someone else will absolutely *fall in love* with. You are light years ahead of this asshole because you *know* this shit is wrong. You just need some encouragement. You need to make sure you aren’t out of line or something. 

Well, I promise you, you are not wrong. He is treating you like shit. You have tried. It is not &amp; will not get better. You know you deserve to be treated like the queen you are, but you are apprehensive, bc breaking up sucks! And you aren’t the one who changed, so it’s a total slap in the face. Just remember though— Better now, than 2 years from now. You’ll be **so much better** off without him."
rel_17775807,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,386,"&gt; What makes you think that there is a 1 to 1 relationship between rapists and rape victims?

Nothing, because I did not say that. But unless there's one mad rapist raping millions of women, 1 in 5 still means there's a *lot* of rape going on. Do you think that all those men are stupid or bad people?

&gt; And for the fourth time, what makes you think that the reason why rape exists is that men just don't know that rape is bad and you need to teach them to solve the problem?

For the fourth time, this isn't as simple as not knowing rape is bad. Consent is a concept that can be tough for ANYONE to inherently internalize, it doesn't make people stupid, especially when young folks get so many contradictory messages about whether no means no. I'm not sure how I can make that clearer because you keep coming back to this as though I haven't explained that I'm not saying men are stupid. How can you yourself say that you don't think no always means no and not understand how that translates to confusion about consent?

Your water analogy demonstrates exactly why it's important to teach consent. Is sex good or bad? Well, it depends on the situation. Sex when both partners enthusiastically consent is good. Sex when one person has been coerced is bad. Sex when someone says no is **bad**. The fact that you're arguing that it isn't necessarily wrong to keep going when someone says no just shows how important it is to teach.

&gt; edit: Oh, also, the reason we don't need to teach men about consent even though we teach children to brush their teeth is that men aren't children. We know about consent. We know. We know. We know. If I type it often enough, hopefully it will sink in.

I'm talking about teaching young folks about consent as they learn about sex. The problem is that many men (and women) were never taught what consent actually looks like, again because of the damaging rhetoric that's existed for a long time, so now we have to retroactively talk about it. And I don't know if you *do* know about consent given you seem to be pretty explicitly saying you don't think no means no."

If that's really the case then couples are sexually assaulting each other on a regular basis. According to the law. Imagine how many husbands and wives are technically mutually raping each other as we speak. Context is very important.

But it seems the law is not being applied equally. If you make the claim of assault based on alcohol, then yes, she actually also assaulted him. This is why I find it silly to base any reasoning for assault on the alcohol. Because that goes both ways.

I know that this type of thinking, if acted upon in certain ways, can isolate my partner.When I bring it up with my SO I let him know that I am aware that these feelings are inappropriate and am working to change them. Besides, I don't WANT to isolate him at all. I don't see this as a problem with him or a problem with his friends, but a problem with myself that I need to fix. 

It feels like I'm riding a wooden roller coaster without a seatbelt. I see no exit so I grab the sides of the cart and listen to my teeth chatter inside my skull. 

I don't fear the end of the relationship. I don't fear cheating. I agree that limiting people's choices takes away their freedom to choose happiness. I wouldn't dream of taking away my partner's ability to choose his life for himself. If he chooses me, then I want to know that he chose me because he loves me, not because I hid the alternative under the rug. 

In some crazy way, I even half-hope that he gets a female roommate just so I can get over this insecurity about other women. 

I just have to keep reminding myself that these feelings of insecurity don't come from an outside source but are generated by my own mind.

Well you know how when you first get in a relationship the two of you fuck like rabbits?! This was us to a T. This particular evening we had came back to his house, his mother was out at the bar. We had a few beers and started going at it. 




About halfway through she comes home and for whatever reason didn't knock on our bedroom door at all. She just swings it wide open and here I am with my ass all the way in the air and he's behind me going to town! She just stands there and it felt like 10 minutes I swear.

rel_15556022,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,410,"Hi OP.  I'm like 15-20 comments down the page and although I've seen people suggest you talk to your doctor about the memory loss stuff, and two people talking about sleepwalking, I haven't seen anyone really talk about the possibility that you might have been in a weird state where you were unconscious but he thought you were conscious and consenting, and you might have even been 'awake' enough to go clean up afterwards and come back to bed, too.  It might be a shitty thing for either of you to have to go through, but I haven't heard anyone else commenting about this yet, so I want to say a few things.

I am a very light sleeper, I have anxiety, etc, and for a few years I was working 3rd shift and having a really hard time sleeping.  I strongly considered taking Ambien or one of those other sleep meds, but I didn't because a coworker of mine had taken them and he told me that what happened to him was that he would take them and then he'd have to go lie in bed because what would basically happen is his conscious brain would shut off but his subconscious would take over and no one would know the difference.

I thought he was making it up but one night at 3 am I had to call him for something related to work (he worked 1st shift) and he half a full half hour conversation with me and then the next morning he came in and saw what I'd done overnight, and asked me why.  He didn't remember a single word of that entire conversation, and I had no idea I wasn't talking to ""him"", if that makes sense.  I absolutely thought I was talking to him, and he was awake.

So my biggest fear was that I'd take those same meds, then go out on the lawn screaming at the neighbors, and the UPS guy, or the kids playing basketball down the block in my boxers (or worse) and not even know what was going on if my sleep was disturbed while I was on those.

Scary stuff, but if you trust your man is telling the truth about not raping you, then maybe you guys will need to make a rule that he's not allowed to have sex with you after you've taken your meds, even if you seem conscious, or even if you instigate it."
rel_38432049,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,234,"Damn this one hits me a little bit personally as a South Asian (Indian) woman married to a Caucasian man from USA because I can relate to the both of you. 

There’s a lot of things going on here. Unfortunately, we are still reeling from the effects of the partition and unpacking our collective trauma, no matter which side of the border we’re from. Added to that, there has been no accountability from the actual colonisers (the British monarchy)+white superiority here in South Asia. It feels insulting when the world criticises the current conditions of the countries without taking the history into consideration. It breeds a lot of anger. That anger manifests in the form of comments such as the one your partner made. Which is not okay 


While you, as an American, have nothing to do with any of this, unfortunately, your comment only reinforces the general disdain for Pakistanis in the West. 

My only advice to (both of) you would be to take a step back. Cool down. Talk it through. Tell her how her comment made you feel hurt. Tell her how upset you really were. Race will be an initial hurdle in your relationship. But there’s nothing you two won’t be able to navigate with a little bit of kindness towards each other.

Which I don’t mind, but when I’m not there, he gets pissed off because he wants to spend time with me and I physically can’t because of whatever I’m doing. And sometimes I feel guilty because I really do want to spend time with him, but sometimes I am working on projects or I’m living my own life. And I have to stop telling myself that this means we are going to break up. I think I just have to come to terms with the fact that this is the actual “work” part of a relationship that most people can’t tolerate and tend to buckle. But him and I communicate a lot and we do but heads but I find that to be very healthy rather than being quiet and not speaking about our needs and voicing our concerns. I just hate the feeling of him being disappointed and annoyed with me. But then I try to think of it like a child. It’s OK for the child to be upset and not agree with the parents decision.

He has seen a separate therapist though and started meditating (which I just can never do...

Hes not perfect but hes working on not over reacting to things that dont matter.

And now im afraid he doesn't look at me the same way. We have been together for almost 2 years and everything has been perfect. Ive managed to hide my eating disorder from him for the duration of this time, until today.

I suffer from extreme binge eating, and bulimia. When i get into a binge i can eat an overly excessive amount of food. Last binge was a 12 inch publix sub, 2 large bags of chips, a small tub of ice cream, 24 ferrero chocolates, a whole box of gushers, 6 cotton candy twinkies, a bag of jellybeans, and 4 sodas. Then i sat down and ate dinner with him an hour later. I eat until im physically sick and throw everything up. Im also a small girl, height and weight wise, so theres no reason to suspect mt over eating. When im done with this, I always hide all the wrappers so no one knows what ive done. Ill usually tie it up in a bag and hide it in the trash. Today, i forgot to hide the bag in the trash and my boyfriend discovered it. The receipt showing that this was all purchased the same day was with the wrappers.

I didnt know what to say. Im utterly humiliated. I ended up confessing everything, and my boyfriend assures me that he still loves me and that its okay, but i cant help but feel like the perception he had of me has changed. I feel like my femininity has been ruined for him. Knowing that your girlfriend can put away that amount of food isnt exactly attractive. Im so ashamed. What do i do?"

Cheating not only hurt somebody’s feelings people have killed themselves over it they starve themselves or can’t cope with life. And then they sit there with a person that they adored and try to work it out. So every once a while, I read a story that’s really hopeful where it’s been years and they love each other and they’ve gone on but that’s an exception it’s not the rule. So how I would do it you have to set boundaries where she is not talking to anyone else in a way that you’re uncomfortable with. Those people have to be cut out then I would suggest couples counseling, and start dating again like you did in the beginning we treat each other well. Also, you need to learn to communicate and for you you need to watch for the signs. You can’t be interesting person that just stands by the side  one thing my husband and I did was we always had an open phone policy open computer knew each others passwords there wasn’t really any hidden stuff.

With this in mind I was not overly keen on the idea when my mum suggested having her little dog at our wedding/ inviting this family over as if my mother saw the kids unknowingly/ purposely upsetting her dog, no matter how much she loves kids she would have lost her shit and gotten very upset if her dog was affected at all (she is very attached to her fur baby). Luckily/ sadly the wedding venue did not allow pets and due to covid and social distancing we didnt visit people before the wedding so crisis averted.

My husband doesn't dislike animals but doesn't feel that 'connection' due to his upbringing like I do. He is not keen on cats (boo) but would like a dog in the future which we plan to get if we ever own our own place. Over the +12 years I have known him he has slowly become more comfortable and confident greeting dogs, which originally he would look at from a distance or ignore. He recognises more dog breeds now and tends to say hello but not always pet unless the dog throws themselves at him (its a long process).We once went to a guide dog training centre open day where they had older puppies you could greet and pet. This was about 10 years ago and back then he wouldn't pet them, then when we left commented how cute they were but felt like he shouldn't go near them. Whenever he points one out in public, I always say we can say hello and ask the owner/ let the dog come to us if they wish. This has slowly helped him 'connect' with them, recognizing their emotions (we are hard followers of the aww subreddit) and respect for them."
rel_33145548,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,143,"Too much drama. 

She ran after him that night, showing where her interest lay. He absolutely will try it on with any girl that is in or is close to a relationship, even yours.  An entirely predictable situation.  People often think they will be immune from the devastation their friends cause, though they have a shield against the bullshit. Well, now you know you do not. You know he hardly gives a damn either. 

If you willingly choose to be friends with someone that enjoys blowing up/ interfering with the relationships of others, then set your expectations this will not be the last time. He will drop snippets of information to fuck with you from time to time, if he is pissed or even bored if there is a lull in the drama. 

This is a person to be avoided, not kept close."
rel_37590703,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,443,"There's a lot to unpack here.  But, first, I'm sorry you have to deal with these hard emotions, especially during the Holiday season.

An observstion:  this bomb was dropped on you deliberately by a vengeful ex wife to hurt both you and your mother.  Keep that in mind, and perhaps save some of your anger for her.

Sometimes... ignorance is bliss.  She could have let all of you be.

Another observation:  the facts of the situation will still be there tomorrow, next week, next month... take the time you need to process and deal with it.  No need to blow things up this instant.  Make sure anything you do is considered and deliberate, not emotional and reactive.

Estimates vary on what percentage of married people cheat.  [Some even estiamate up to 70 over the course of a marriage.](https://hernorm.com/infidelity-statistics/)  something like 50% of marriages end in divorce, with a leading cause infidelity.  So, your mom and this situation is not unique.  

This happened a while ago.  What the circumstances might have been you can really never know.  While most people say infidelity is wrong, the same people when they cheat say they were justified.  Monogamy is really, really hard, and some people are not affectionate, sexual, or both.  When a person is starving for something they don't get, they can make bad decisions.

Ultimately, people do shit things.  All the time.  Hypocritically.  There's an adjustment some of make where we just accept that.  We can't control what other people do.  We can only control how we react.  We can be bitter or angry... or we can decide to let it go, and not let it destroy our happiness.  

""Should"" is also something I've struggled with, personally.  People shouldn't lie, cheat, steal, abuse others mentally, physically, emotionally.  They should be honest, and respect each other.  But ""should"" is a trap.  Life isn't this way, and expecting it is can make you bitter.  I've learned to forgive others, for my own mental and emotional health.  Eventually.  ;)  If you need time to rage, take it.

We are all a collection of good and bad, shit and things we've overcome.  We all have our secrets.  Things we've kept quiet to not hurt others.  Our personal failings, and betrayals of others we recall with a chill in the dead of night.

I do know that close relationships are rare.  Hold on to them if you can.  Really, you are dealing with the infidelity as if you were the one cheated on.  And you were.  But many if not most relationships survive infidelity.  I hope yours does, too.

Good luck.  I'm pulling for you and wishing you the best."
rel_7972703,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,308,"Yep. My boyfriend and I don't have a lot of money, but money is still sometimes an issue. Sometimes personalities come into play. At first, I'd often not let my boyfriend pay for me, and he wouldn't let me pay for him.

Sometimes feelings about money represent an incompatibility in a relationship. It's either something you both work through with compromises, or you find someone else.

2 years of living with my bf later, we are more mellow about it. We know each other's situation and are understanding. If I don't have a lot of money but I want to buy something, he lets me. Because it's my money and I get to do with it what I like, and vice versa.

However, we often share some the decisions of money. We talk about our purchases daily, and if we want to go out or plan something, we talk about that too BEFOREHAND. lol

Life is like this. Not everything is always going to be split 50-50, because sometimes ""50-50"" is not what's actually ""fair"" or necessary, nor conducive to happiness.

Often, a partner with money will find themselves wanting a lifestyle their partner can't afford. In these situations, you just have to talk about it. Tell them that it's not their burden to pay for a lifestyle they didn't ask for, so they shouldn't have to. But you, with money, you'd like to include them because you want them there. 

There's a two-way thing here. Your gf's feelings about being self-sufficient are important, but so are your feelings of wanting to share life with her. You both deserve consideration.

Also, if you guys have other issues that are contributing to your ideas and feelings about money, then you should try to open up about those. That post about the Eastern Euro culture difference is a perfect example."

This one here is a thought I've wrestled with. Who would you rather exist? Someone who has no limits to their love for you? And, what kind of person would you rather be? Someone who's love can conquer anything, or someone who has the possibility of being defeated?

My focus has been singular. Listen to interviews of champions in sports - you need to make this a part of your personality, an integral part of yourself. No is not an option. There is one thing that motivates my soul, and I need to give all of myself to it. Anything less makes it a lie and a failure.

She isn't going to change unless she has an overwhelming cause to change.  You see the future and it is bleak and lacking intimacy.  It will destroy your self image, self confidence, and ego. 

Before my wife and I married we dated for five years. She was very conservative and due to our religious background she wanted to wait until marriage to have intercourse.  Over the years she gradually accepted that we advanced from hands over clothes to hands under clothes to removing clothes.  She enjoyed when I would give her oral but she only have me oral once and only brought me to orgasm once during our five years of dating.  She assured me that once married she would feel more comfortable with giving me sexual pleasure.  The months leading up to our marriage had no intimacy of any kind.  She said it was too make our wedding night and honeymoon more special. Our wedding night she didn't want to have sex but eventually relented.  She orgasmed and seemed to enjoy it.  We had sex once on our honeymoon.  We had sex 11 times our first year married and our frequency went down after that.

We began to have our children and we went over a year without sex with each pregnancy.

We had a deadbedroom for 19 years. 

When I tell you that it won't get better I hope you believe me.

Maybe your experience would be different.  But you have been warned."
rel_2713754,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,229,"It's interesting that your solutions for your daughter were basically the same: 

&gt;some people just have issues like that, maybe the teacher hates her job, maybe she has other issues going on

&gt;our daughter should cut the teacher some slack, and try to find some common ground with the teacher

Your husband isn't as quick to take your daughter's side or believe everything she says as you are. This is good. He can ground you when you're blindly supporting a mistake your daughter is making, and you can snap him into reality when he's missing the seriousness of an issue your daughter has. You can balance each other out, and like here, your basic advice is the same: empathize with the teacher if possible, then suck it up and make the best of it.

I don't think this is a fight worth having. His advice to your daughter is not bad, and neither is yours. It's good that she'll get varying perspectives. Often, he will be right; be open to that and hopefully he will be as well. 

Also, yo, referring to his optimistic assumptions as ""lying"" is hyperbole that will fuck your marriage right up. He's not lying about the teacher by giving her a positive benefit of the doubt. That's the wrong word to use, and it will start a fight, and that will be on you.

rel_1050796,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,311,"All the standard roommate discussions apply (cleaning, bills, space, etc.) but I would also discuss timeline of an upcoming proposal or marriage.  It could end up causing problems if she is under the impression that a proposal will happen in a few months and you are thinking a few years.  As long as you both have the same expectations then you can avoid this pitfall.  If not, it will turn into a constant topic of discussion which will feel like nagging to you and she will feel like she has to push the idea of marriage repeatedly.  It loses all of its romance this way.

Also talk about what unspoken gestures you each respond to.  It is easy when you live with someone to just go through the day to day and let life happen without making special moments together.  For example, my husband and I are very independent, but if he just goes off and does something he wants to do without asking if I want to join him then my feelings are hurt since I feel left out.  Another example is affection.  I am one of those cuddly people who needs a good hug and cuddle at the end of a long day and he just isn't.  Neither way is better than the other, but we have learned to communicate about it.  I don't quietly sit and wait for affection getting angry if it doesn't happen, now I speak up and say ""today was brutal, hug me!"" and in turn he works to recognize those moments and give me a little affection before I have to ask for it.

Really, as long as you have a good fighting style that works then you should be able to talk through anything that comes up.  Mutual respect and consideration are key, but that is true with any friend or roommate situation."

rel_2304662,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,241,"Honestly, people who have lots of friends generally aren't that happy. Content people have very few friends, but the friends that are true friends are the ones you can go weeks or months without talking to, but when you get in touch, it's as if you just spoke a couple days prior.
I used to have a large group of friends in high school, like 12 or 15 that I'd see all the time. Then one day I realized I couldn't fucking stand hearing most of them even talk. So by my last year in high school I was down to about 5 friends that I saw regularly. As of now I'm 29M, I have my lifelong best friend who is married with 2 children, so we see each other MAYBE once a month, but probably less than that. My other best friend I've known since I was 3 is engaged and just moved to another province and is gone for 4 years before he plans to move back. So I won't be seeing him unless I go to visit or vice-versa. Another friend I see once a week, just go out to dinner so I don't go stir-crazy lol
And another friend she is a realtor that I see maybe every three or so months for dinner.

Aside from that, I have one female friend that I'm hoping will soon be more than that. And I'm very content with that."

Our bodies literally get addicted to people. When we form an attachment bond, we get happy chemicals from them.  And when we break up, we lose the source of those chemicals. By going back to his profile, you’re getting just a tiny bit of those chemicals again. Enough to keep you hooked. 

The only way to break free is to stop. When I’m in that situation, I just remind myself that I’m only prolonging the misery. Then- this is really important- I go do some other healthy, or neutral, or at least less toxic, thing that will also give me good chemicals. Go for a run. Dance to your favorite song. Eat some chocolate. Get a hug from a friend. Flirt with someone else. Masturbate. (But not to your ex!) Anything that will redirect your thoughts, and give you happiness from another source.

We all have different ideas of people in our heads and no matter how hard we try we will never be able to get others see the way we do. She probably sees him in. A negative way right now cause he hurt you and so she’s in full on mama bear mode. I don’t remember his post 100% but he did seem pretty remorseful of what happened and that he cares and loves you and only you and making that post instead of being open and honest with you was a dumdum move. If you truly think he deserves a second chance then make it clear it’s on your terms and that he knows people in your life aren’t going to be happy about it and he may need to win their trust back. She only knows who he is through word of mouth like a game of telephone. She knows him through who other sees him as and wrong doings he’s done before. Just know she’s just trying to protect you and your heart even though it’s in the completely wrong way. If anything just give each other closure if you think you can handle that. Go to a quiet place, sit, and think what is going to make you the happiest?? I agree sometimes mama knows best and my final piece advice is possibly if you know someone else who knows your ex both before you guys dated and during that you can talk about this to and what they’re prospective of it all might help!!"

Begging to get them to talk. So I mean, when you catch on she's doing it just say tell her when she's ready to talk you'll be here.

rel_20144289,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,289,"&gt;I try not to think that it’s because he’s not attracted to me but why else go behind my back like that?

I'll try to be gentle. You really don't see other reason than ""he's not attracted to you"" for this behavior? Try to be logical about it, take the emotion of betrayal you feel and think it in a realistic way. I understand you not being ok with him turning himself on with accounts in snapchat or with specific people, but are you able to understand how from another person's perspective this is not a big deal too? It's not a defense for him, if this is a boundary in your relationship dump him if you want. But I'm having troubles with your logic ""he lied to me about a girl and some snap account"" therefore ""he's not attracted to me anymore"". That's not how humans work, and specially men. Yeah to be lied is not pretty but it's also realistic in this small insignificant amount , people lie about stupid stuff that they know would get them into trouble or into a conversation that they'd rather not have. Specially if they are young. That in any way diminish his attraction or love towards you, he's just being a human. I think you have an idealistic way of thinking this relationship, so small things like this transform into big dramas.

As I told you, dump him if you think this is important and specially if there's no trust anymore, because there's no point in having a relationship without trust. But from an outsider's perspective this is not a big deal and I think it's triggering your insecurities making you a little crazy about it. Good luck with it."

Second, her dad probably should’ve told her that and came back and checked the place out and made sure it was okay before letting his daughter go back in especially since he left the door open. Third, some people really don’t want the cops involved in their lives for whatever reason so even though I get why you called and think it probably was smart since her and her dad didn’t make the best decisions, you should respect her wishes. I might’ve gotten a little upset if cops were in my home and I wasn’t the one who called them. Fourth, as her boyfriend you should’ve went even though you called the cops and been there as well. She wanted you there and that kind of comes with the boyfriend territory…especially when you call the cops when you’re asked not to.

Needing help isn't wrong but crediting you current bf with getting back on your feet, and crediting 11F's father with getting her out means your daughter hasn't seen much of you, her female role model, fighting for a good life and making good choices. As much as you say you waited a year to start another relationship, it's clear by the sheer fact that you let this man get so close and keep pursuing you, you haven't enforced boundaries around yourself and your children.

I can't imagine being a teenager in a wildly unstable home and there's a whole new man that keeps showing up. You need to step away from dating while the oldest is still at home. Your desire to have a partner doesn't trump your daughters' wellbeing. Only one of your daughters has another reliable parent in their life. The other two just have you and you cannot bring another man into their lives as long you haven't healed and learnt to choose better.

And lastly, do not have another child. Make sure your birth control is solid and you are using multiple forms. You need to focus on the kids you have and who need you. I'm sure you get plenty of judgement for having three kids with three different men so I won't add to that. Give your time to those kids for now and don't worry about finding a man."

I, too, would doubt very much that the weed itself was to blame, but she has clearly developed a negative association with it.  You don't have to stay with her if you don't want to, and if smoking weed is an important part of your life to you - that's a valid decision.  She also doesn't have to stay with you if you begin smoking again; if her negative association with weed is that severe, that too would be a valid decision.

Ultimately, you're going to have to make up your mind.  She seems very sensitive to this issue, so personally I believe that you should respect that - but if you can't be happy while respecting it (i.e. if you can't be happy not smoking), you are certainly free to leave her."

rel_21485219,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,143,"My frank answer is that your boyfriend might be someone who's a bit more in the demisexual camp. This might be doubly true if y'all were sexually active to begin with, but later on the appeal has definitely declined.   


As a guy, especially when you're older in late 20's, chances are you're over the ""I'm a virgin"" hump. You've solved the mystery behind sex, so all that's left is finding a relationship where that carnal appeal is something that is reinforced by a partner they can connect to. Your approach to sex may just not be something he vibes with, but he's keeping you around because he'd rather have a ""meh"" connection than none at all. Considering your relationship has been going for about a year, I think it's definitely worth re-evaluating your connection! The honeymoon phase has definitely worn off by now."

rel_24399182,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,226,"I have a touch of OCD so I like to be facing the door and walking street side.  When I was first dating my wife, I was more subtle with it than you are.  For example: when we are on the way to the table I walk in such a way that I'm naturally seated facing the door.  Then I don't have to ask my wife to switch seats after the fact.  I eventually told her I'm a little OCD about it and she understands.  Maybe I'm OCD because I was subconsciously conditioned to do this :D 

Your GF probably would have been more receptive to this if you didn't:

A) expect her to do things like change seats after she's already sat down.

B) say thing like ""this is how I was taught to HANDLE women"".  It might feel like she is overreacting about things like walking along the street, but honestly bro you set the stage for that when you presented it the way you did.

Regardless of anything else, if she came to you and said she wants you to stop treating her like this, you really don't have any choice but to do exactly that.  You can explain to her where you're coming from on it, but if she doesn't like it, you'll have to get over it and stop doing it."

You may think you have raised four well mannered children but to others I bet it’s the opposite for we can only see the side of the coin that presents itself and to see the other half you have to go out of your way and find it. Most people don’t. To you, having a job and paying taxes is being an adult. When in reality it has nothing to do with being an adult. Does having kids make you an adult? I bet single people could argue that point till the end of time. What I’m trying to get across is that, being 27 and living with your parents does not make you a loser. Being unproductive during a global pandemic does not make you a loser. If it’s his life dream to support his mom and dad until they die then who are we to judge that choice. I’m sure he will get a job within the next coming months when shit starts to settle down. But to take a break after law school I’d say he’s less of a loser than the rest of us. We didn’t go to law school. We didn’t experience what he went through. How can you blindly judge someone like that is beyond me. Like I said before you may think you’re a good person but maybe you should look deeper inside and find out who you really are and take a good look at the people around you."

Yea right, cheating again.” 
Is it difficult? Very. And it takes alot of work on both partners to make it happen. If the one who was unfaithful is not putting in the effort to show they want to earn the trust, then by all means burn that bridge. BUT! If they are going above and beyond each and everyday without fail, then do not hold it against them. Forgive them every single day. Make the choice to not allow yourself to doubt them. 
Cheating can definitely seem unforgivable, but it doesn’t always have to be. 
It is your choice whether you are willing and able to allow them back into your heart. And it is their choice whether or not to actually make things right again."

rel_9075344,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,244,"&gt;He started telling me he loved me since the first 5-6 days we spent talking! And he barely knew anything about me at that time, so I have been wondering how he could love me so deeply, so quickly. 

You were right to wonder. He *couldn't*, because he didn't know you. He was infatuated with his idea of you. 


&gt;he said he would commit suicide if I leave him and that was not the only time he threatened me of committing suicide. Sometimes we argue about other things and he keeps talking about suicide. He says that his life will be over if i leave him. I really don't know if that's true love or something else. 

That is not true love, that is abuse. The website I'm linking is about how to identify abuse in romantic relationships:

https://www.loveisrespect.org/content/when-your-partner-threatens-suicide/

&gt;One more thing. When we met, he told me he hates living in his country. On the other hand, I have two nationalities and I can live wherever I want, either in my country in the middle east or in another country in europe. So i also wonder if he sees me as a way to get out of his country. 

Honestly, given how much he talks about money, yes, I would say he sees you as a way to a better life.

How old are both of you? How long have you been talking with him? Have you and he ever met in person?"
rel_19314369,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,103,"I mean you could try talking to him about it but given the evidence you've presented the only one wondering is you. He's repeatedly shown you time &amp; time again you aren't even worth a video call (believe me you are) or a drive (again, you are worth that and more). Do you really want to invest more into someone who you have to ask why they aren't giving more of an effort from the get go? I would personally just cut your loses and try to move on. Plenty of guys out there who mean what they say &amp; he isn't it."
rel_2173342,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,292,"Just from one guy's perspective, I see a lot of ""He's absolutely perfect"" followed up by ""I'm self harming and losing my mind over something he's doing"".  The two don't mix.

He doesn't have to be a soulmate to be a good partner, but you do have to have communication and compromise.

Have you TOLD him that this bugs you, or have you just cleaned it up and grumbled about it?  How does he respond when you go ""Hey, Honey?  Whats with all this fucking salt/2 day old cake/honey on the counter/etc?  Does he apologize and clean it, or does he shrug his shoulders and ignore it?

If you are just cleaning up after him and not holding him accountable, then he has no reason to stop.  And I don't mean ""Clean it up and then yell at him later"" I mean make him clean it up when he gets home. Tell him to spend 30 minutes cleaning out a nasty garbage bag, tell him to do his own fucking dishes.

If he refuses, then you have bigger issues than cleanliness, because you guys have differing views on what is expected to maintain a household.

Whether he was raised in an environment where it was always messy, or in one where he never had to clean because it was always done for him, somewhere in his mind he either doesn't think what he's doing is wrong, or doesn't even realize he's doing it, and the first thing you have to do is make him realize that what he's been doing is unacceptable.

Also, if you're self-harming yourself over it, that's a BIG MASSIVE RED FLAG and you should be taking more note of that.  Maybe you should talk to somebody about it?"

Also the best friend sounds very manipulative and OP and her were ""like sister"".

So if I change the genders, as a woman, and try to imagine myself in this situation, I can totally see me being ashamed and uncomfortable with talking about it and also being scared of getting accused if I open up.

I'm just saying it isn't a uncommon reaction for victims of sexual harassment and if we switch the genders a lot more people would probably be more understanding towards the victim."
rel_4409896,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,296,"Hey, thanks for your input- just a bit more information to clarify. 

I work Fridays/Saturdays as a server from 5-10pm. Neither of us have class on Fridays, but he has baseball practice an hour away without traffic (and we live in the bay area so traffic is widespread). Every Saturday morning he has a baseball game to play in, which usually does end up going up until I have to leave for work. 

During the school week, I usually end classes at noon to 1. And he has baseball practice after his classes so he has to commute there, practice for 3 hours, and then commute back. So most of his time is dedicated to baseball or his studies. He quit baseball for 2 years and now has decided to go back and pursue the mlb. While I do know that this goal is a stretch, it makes him happy and I understand that if he’s serious about it, he will have to dedicate a lot of his time to catching up and improving. 

I know my schedule on weekends could open up time but my boss won’t allow me to solely work weekdays as a server because of how busy our restaurant is. (I pay for my schooling so I can’t quit either as its the best paying job I’ve had)

Sundays is usually our free day but is also when his brother has baseball tournaments which usually take up the entire day as their family goes out to eat. And I don’t want time to be taken from there as his family also should get time with him. 

My apologies if it seemed like it was all coming from him, it definitely is on my work schedule as well. I really appreciate your input

It seems really weird that he’s always doing the lessons in a secretive place. The upstairs living room.

My brother is in 12th grade and claims he’s doing it for extra money. But I doubt that’s the case.

I hid in the laundry basket prior to the lesson. I peaked out whenever I could.

I saw him sexually touching the girl, repeatedly kissing her, putting his hands down her pants, etc. 

He was also teaching her too (not as much as he would if he wasn’t so distracted touching her), and he gave her candy and told her to promise she wouldn’t say a word about what happened.

I felt terrified of my brother. I didn’t want to escape because I’m afraid he would beat me up. I had to stay in the basket the entire goddamn time. Until his lesson ended. It was fucking sweaty as hell. But music helped pass time, and social media. 

The thing is I want to report him so badly. It was disgusting that he preyed on a little kid like that.

I don’t care if he’s 18. Even if he was 15 (my age) and did the same shit would report him. Pretty sure that even for a minor the consequences would be severe.

But I know my parents. Very well. They would definitely call the police and have my brother arrested for sure.

That’s because I recorded him doing it. I have evidence. So it won’t be my word. It’ll be my video. If I tell them, I’d have to show the video too. 

But again debating it. My brother already applied for colleges and he’s excited to go to (college name) and I don’t want to ruin his chances.

Telling my parents is going to lead to a police charge. They don’t give two shits.

What do I do?"

You will have to find different family or keep in contact with family members that side with you. I don't know who is right or who is wrong here. What I understand is you don't belong in that family. But that will only benefit you. They made a decision, so now they are screwed."

Was he repressing his sexuality at the time and using you as a beard or did he not yet realize he was more attracted to men? 

I think you need to think things through for a while instead of making a snap judgement that you definitely want to stay together. Your husband might have married you knowing he was gay because he wanted the traditional family. The ""chemistry"" could all be acting on his end. Or maybe this really has been a recent revelation to him that he is most attracted to men. I think that's an important distinction to make. The biggest question to answer is whether or not he is he attracted to you romantically as well as sexually. 

If not why would you settle for a marriage with only platonic love? You've still got decades ahead of you and life is too short to go through it only going through the motions. Under those circumstances I would also assume the chances of infidelity occuring would be very high."
rel_7206932,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,312,"When I met my ex, there’s certain things he did that made me fall in love with him, consistently and without me asking him. When he slowly stopped , I would ask him to do those things. . And some times he would and sometimes he wouldn’t. I sat down with him and I talked to him about it and he got it and understood and knew those things mattered to me. 

To restructure the conversion tailoring it to your issue . Tell him you fell in love with him because he always used to cuddle without being asked and also include other great things he does. Also because it’s obvious it’s important to you tell him cuddling is a huge part of your love language (or jus tell him why you live it so much) . Address the objection he used on heat, say we now have aircon so it should be okay ? If he gives another excuse , ask him point blank if he doesn’t like cuddling and just be honest with you because it’s better you just know. Depending on his answer , assuming he says no I don’t like cuddling , then you decide what you want to do. 

I will be honest, I’ve once dated a none cuddler, with me I don’t require cuddling all the time, but it’s nice for someone to just want to cuddle you by themselves. Plus when I need one, I like that that person embraces the request and is nice about it. Dating a none cuddler opened up a whole side of me I never realised I had. An open one cuddler makes me feel lonely. I’m not a “cuddler “ but if I date a guy that likes a lot of cuddles I will give him cuddles. I actually learnt that side of me by dating a non cuddler."
rel_35094499,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,161,"That's a part of the deal I think. Do you always progress your flirts in the same way? If you flirt, do you always try to move into kissing? If you kiss, do you always try to sensually touch?

If she expects that transition, it's more likely she might reject you because she isn't giving herself the chance to relax and enjoy the process, since she expects that you just want sex and she doesn't immediately feel like it.

It could be that your relationship lacks the spark of intimacy, where you don't know what to expect from your partner and it's exciting.
I can see it from you where your sex positions don't excite you, and for her the way you initiate advances may be repetitive.

I'd recommend trying to learn about sexual intimacy and lifestyle intimacy, and communicate with her about you wanting to try something new. Try see gauge how she feels when you say things.

Good luck"

Would you consider sleeping with other people and opening the relationship? Although that would be a temporary fix because open relationships only when when there is a strong foundation and lots of trust. But if you feel like you are so attached to him and can’t leave, this could be a short term fix. It will surprise him and show him you’re not a loyal doormat, and most importantly you will realize there are better men out there. 

Or, you can suck it up and accept the fact that he will never change, understand that you deserve to be loved. Know that it will hurt.

Clarify IN PERSON , what you thought he was saying, what you meant, what you didn't mean, and that you're sorry for hurting his feelings. Reassure him (if you do feel this way) that you're still attracted to him, yada yada, and that your not judging his masculinity or whatever.

If he is still being petty, he needs to figure his shit out. It's no longer your problem if you've done your due diligence to him.

rel_9035151,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,220,"You’re welcome, whenever I am having one of those talks with my husband, I try to remind myself. “Be curious not furious”, and just ask questions, calmly, to get a better understanding of where he is coming from with all of it.

Edit: people are being a little harsh with you in my opinion. The way I understood this scenario is that the last you heard from him, he was on his way home (unless I misunderstood?). If I thought my husband was on his way home and five hours later he wasn’t home I would be worried too. If the last I heard from husband is that he was headed to a bar with friends, much less worried if I hadn’t heard from him for five hours. 
Either way, the bottom line for you is that you were worried and relationships are about negotiating and working together so that everyone can feel comfortable.

Unfortunately, the world we live in has monsters in it, and that puts people on edge. My advice is to talk to this woman, tell her that you view her child as your own, and feel like a second father to her daughter. Ease her worries by telling her that you will not do anything to make her uncomfortable.

rel_20985418,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,141,"Well, I'm talking to them because they've been a good friend to me for a while and it came up one day that we liked each other. Unfortunately, we live so far away and we agreed we wouldn't do a serious long-distance relationship and eventually things turned sexual but it was clear we were still casual. I'll drop talking sexually/intimately once I start dating the other woman because I'd be uncomfortable doing that.

It's not about keeping them on a hook until something better pops up, it's a casual sexual relationship between two people that aren't able to be in a serious one. I'm hoping that I've made that clear to her as I've referred to us as casual in the past and the fact I can't do long distance would imply any type of sexual relationship would be temporary, right?"
rel_9710127,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,229,"You could either be dealing with one or both situations:

&amp;#x200B;

1. You're currently at the stage in your relationship when the reality of it all sets in. You're really used to your partner now and feel like the relationship is one-sided. You constantly think about breaking up because you feel like the spark, the goals, and the unconditional love for one another that you both once had is gone and don't feel like it aligns with your expectations anymore.
2. You both simply have grown and fallen out of love.

&amp;#x200B;

Whichever one may be the case know that both are completely normal and can be overcome with commitment and communication, only if you both feel like your relationship is worth saving and continuing. To do this you both need to sit down with one another and reevaluate your goals, you might even have to make a few sacrifices (only sacrifice if you both are 100% okay and onboard with making a sacrifice in the name of your relationship). 

You need to air out any issues, no matter how big or small they may be in order to solve you guy's problems from the roots up. Every single relationship runs into this problem, no matter what. It's how both parties react and tackle this that determines whether or not they decide to stay together.

But seriously dude I hope you can walk away from this if that’s your decision. She screams and shouts at you and when you respond in kind it’s all about how you made her feel and how she is “scared”.

This is a beautiful tactic some women use to convince you you’re the problem, using hot button issues such as physical abuse. Once they introduce the thought, the very notion that they are afraid of being “hit” it’s enough to make most guys back down, despite their girlfriends being in the wrong ( I’m speaking solely on your case).

I think she clearly still has feelings for you. But she has other responsibilities that she needs to fulfill, and your relationship is taking too much time for her, even if she is making the choice to spend that time with you herself (because she really does want to spend it with you).

So she is conflicted, but she made a choice for her future (which I personally agree with, not because of you, but because it's her future) and you are making it really difficult for her to stick to that decision. No, it's not the best situation for you, but she is under a lot of stress and you're really not helping.

rel_9348501,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,302,"&gt;Last night my girlfriend confided in me that she was very up set that night and after crying and telling herself she was going to break up with me she ended up kissing her friend who is another 18 year old girl, my girlfriend is bisexual so this wasn’t very shocking to hear but it was still hard to hear.

Listen, you're a young man so it makes sense that you're insecure about such things, but you need to understand that girls just like to play with girls sometimes. It's not a threat to you or cheating or anything like that. It's honestly more like advanced tickling than cheating. With maturity, you'll become more secure in your masculinity and accept it.  

It's certainly not something you should break up with her over. 

&gt;We are both deeply in love and completely infatuated with one another, every moment I spend with her is precious to me, but we fight a lot over really dumb things and she feels I don’t make enough time for her and frankly it’s because I don’t.

If you really love her then you will find the time to be with her, but these are little issues. 

&gt;but if I leave her I’m afraid she might harm herself and I don’t want anything bad to happen to her

Don't worry too much about this. Physically she'll be fine. That being said, she'll be irrevocably scarred emotionally and probably have issues developing romantic attachments for years. 

&gt;but I feel I can never truly be the person she wants me to be and I believe she knows that.

You're still young. You have decades to grow as a person and you *will* grow (hopefully). At 18 your life isn't even a quarter over. Don't discount yourself before you've even hit first base."
rel_33272689,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,347,"She's manipulating you into believing what you did (snooping) was worse than what she did (cheating). 

But I honestly believe if you ever feel the need to snoop through someone's stuff like that - the relationship is already over. The trust is gone and  most always your intuition is right. When you start feeling like something is off or things aren't adding up - listen to that feeling. Don't be in relationships with people where honest communication about things can't be had. Don't waste your time on people who can't admit they are wrong. 

&gt;I guess right now, I'd just like some advice on how I could maybe fix things and if not, advice on what to do now.

Listen, there absolutely are couples out here that overcome cheating. They do exist. But you need to ask yourself why you want to fix this. You need have an honest conversation with yourself about this. Could you ever trust her again? Could you ever have a normal relationship where there are no questions in the back of your mind again? Will staying with her, someone who won't even talk through this with you, end up changing you for the worst? Something to think about is some people who stay with cheaters find it makes them almost toxic in the relationship- always questioning, always expecting it to happen again, always needing to go through their phone/social media whatever. Is this the life you want to live? Is that the person **you** want to be? 

Would I stay? Absolutely not. But none of us are you. None of us are in this relationship. You need to take some time for yourself and really figure out what you want and why you want it. But if she's not willing to stop manipulating the conversation about all this and stop gaslighting you into thinking that your snooping is somehow worse than her cheating then I really don't see how you two can recover here. She's got to be willing to be honest with you. I don't think you're going to get that."

I'm sure you already sense that none of that is actually real or true, but you still feel trapped in his orbit by guilt and obligation.  It's not going to be easy to break free, but the absolute best thing you can do right now - for HIS sake, as well as for your own - is to break up with him, block him on all your accounts, and then tell your parents or another trusted adult about what he has threatened to do.  I think it would also be worthwhile to ask them to set up some therapy sessions for yourself, so you can process and understand everything he's put you through.

rel_180394,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,399,"[CDC info](http://www.cdc.gov/hpv/)

First off, there is no test for HPV for men.  As the other poster above me said, there's a very good chance that she got it from you, and if she didn't, you undoubtedly have been infected by now.  Men very rarely show symptoms and will usually act as a carrier.  From what I understand, it's totally normal for the virus to remain dormant for a period of several months after the initial infection.  Whether she got it from you or not, your body has a good chance of defeating the virus over time and clearing it from your system (assuming you're otherwise healthy), so this isn't necessarily something you're going to have for the rest of your life.  That said, you still have an obligation to tell future partners.

All in all, it's not that big of a deal for guys.  For girls it's a bigger deal because of the association with cancer, but the strains of HPV that cause warts are generally not the same as the ones that cause cancer.  Many people infected with HPV carry multiple strains (there are over 100), so sometimes you'll get both the cancer-causing variety and the wart-causing variety at the same time.  Some strains will remain dormant in some people and be very active in others, so it's always a roll of the dice anyway.  

HPV is extremely contagious (skin-to-skin contact is all you need), almost everyone has some form of it at some point in their life without ever knowing about it.  You can literally get it from shit like climbing the ropes in gym class, so condoms are no protection and there's really no shame in having it.  

When my girlfriend and I began seeing each other, she told me up front that she had HPV.  I did my research and spent some time thinking about it and decided that life is too short to pass up a girl like her over something like this, so I rolled the dice and exposed myself to her infection.  I absolutely do not regret the decision as me and the ol' lady live together now and things are going better than I could have expected.  We have no way of knowing if she passed the virus on to me since her symptoms had been dormant for some time before we got together and I never developed any symptoms either.  "

rel_28118893,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,454,"Everyone here thinking that anything about relationships  and the human heart, especially the female half of the species, can.be in black and white is really out of touch with reality. 

First, the OP is not the gatekeeper to P's love life.  He has no say about it as a friend, even if she is closer to him, emotionally, than his own family.

Second, the OP needs to realize that this isn't malice or any betrayal of him, but the fact that she's just dumb.

Because it's not about you, and to expect her to align her choices with your wounded emotional status is unfair.

You (the OP) are taking this hard because you put her on a pedestal, and found out she's capable of being as shallow as everyone else.

You are also fearing you will lose your adoptive, surrogate family; because unless he has undergone a dramatic emotional renovation, he will push her to push you out.

However, that was always a strong possibility.  No man likes the ""he's like a brother, but not really a brother"" hanging around their girl.  Especially not the emotionally stunted type of people who are prone to bullying.

I feel for you.  No one who said they would have your back, did so.

Your family sided with your cousin?  Was there money involved (aka, his Dad is the rich uncle?)

However, I hope they don't expect to ever meet their grandkids or expect you to lift a finger when the rest of the jackals in the family throw them in a budget retirement home and hock all their personal shit for money.

As for P, it all depends on whether or not the bully has changed.  I saw some people change drastically, even just months after moving out on their own and dealing with adult life.
One acquaintance, about as far away from an upstanding individual as you could imagine, went to college and came back a million times calmer and nicer; he just had to exit an abusive family life to become better.

If he hasn't changed though, it's not your problem when she starts ""falling over furniture.""  She knew what she's getting into, and if she is self-destructive she would have ended up with someone similar. 

As for you, NoMFuP is the term to guide you forward.  
Not My Fucking Problem.

Don't know if P is the shallow type who mistakes sociopathic men for ""alphas"" and goes for that.
Not my problem, not yours.
She starts getting bruises and pushes you away, don't let it be your problem.

You don't get to protect her from shitty decisions, nor should she do that for you.

rel_37169746,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,201,"Do you actually have the same goals if he picks holes in everything you do and complains about you not doing enough?

Do you work? Because I don’t know how you’re meant to do more home making activities if you’re also working, (and also have more sex) which presumably his mother and grandmother did not, and didn’t have a choice in the matter. 

If he’s like this with everything (no job is good enough, no house is good enough, no car is good enough) then it seems like his “problems” with you are the same: it’s not you, it’s him, and he’ll never be happy and content with anything. 

It sucks and I’m sure he’s fun and lovely in other ways but this thing about him is not going to change unless he understands that it’s a him problem he needs to work on - and that you can’t upgrade people, we aren’t cars, and he shouldn’t make serious commitments to a person (IE marrying you) if he’s not actually going to take it seriously and then try to mould you into a “perfect” person. You are an individual and I’m pretty sure your life is very different from his mother’s"
rel_31121735,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,227,"Well, for starters, maybe really promise yourself to change your tone, because I (25M) can imagine it being there, seeing his reaction and since you admit that you can be passive aggressive.

I also grew up with certain family members like that, so I get how that can get under his nerves and how he thinks you do it to provoke a reaction (which is often the case, even though maybe with you it's not). It's unbearable to live with in the long run and the fact that he said you'll promise it and not follow through, means that you've probably promised it in the past.

So if he doesn't want to do couples counseling (which was a great idea of yours, to be honest), then figure out a way to do solo counseling or work on yourself to install a different type of instinctive reaction within you. That way, you don't need him to do anything, but you show him that you're working on yourself, doing an effort to meet him half way. Later on, he can address his frustrations &amp; anger issues too.

If you can't do this, it seems like your relationship is pushed past a certain point, where you're on a cliff and you know how this will end... So I hope you find the motivation &amp; courage to work on yourself :)"
rel_37787765,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,247,"So now curiosity got a hold of me and I went back through his emails and it’s obvious he cheated on every girlfriend he’s previously had, and in our first year with me with at least a handful of times physically and another handful online emails with all these girls writing him. He wanted to have his citizenship opportunities. What’s to say he didn’t do it in our marriage also?
Back then I knew he cheated once so I broke up, and  months later he begged me to give it another chance so we hung out but I was so young and said to myself I’ll get back with him only to show him revenge for how he treated me. Well I revenged him only to feel bad about it and never let him find out. I fell for him and saw how much he missed his family and I figured if our relationship didn’t work out at least I helped him to see his family again. I was 21 in college and married.. my parents were upset once we told them, made a big deal that our family doesn’t believe in divorce, we need to work it out like a married couple, so we moved in together, he proposed to me with a big ring, saved up and had two huge weddings. The rest is history (post above). Please roast me as much as needed and advice, I feel like I need a slap to reality."

rel_21737487,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,307,"Hi there, I’d like to chime in if I may. 

To be fair, without the context of your now current ex. It wouldn’t be fair to presume as much as we could against her. Meaning that there are just too many variables to look into without knowing concrete proof of your ex’s viewpoint. 

That being said, I support your perspective. I’m the biggest advocate for trust in the relationship. By the sense of your post. I genuinely feel you mean what you said: “I do not believe I have done anything sus. What’s more I know what I want and can affirm I have committed no infidelity physical, emotional or etc.”

If these words are true and they also align with your actions of not committing anything wrong to tarnish your relationship. Then I hate to say this my friend. If she decides to leave (which she did) then so be it. You provided your whole truth. You explained when she asked for an explanation. I can also see where you may have edged off a little of your own self respect with the whole activity tracker you mentioned, but I also understand pleading your case completely in showing you didn’t mean any harm and would do anything to prove it. I’ve been there. But if you were telling the truth to begin with, then you owe yourself to stand by those words and affirmations. 

Trust is important. Communication is up there too. Probably 1st priority in relationships. All of this is a learning lesson for both parties. Sadly, your truth was just not enough for your current ex to accept. 

Not all is lost. Let your emotions ride out. And continue pushing through. 

You got this Champ 💪🏼 PM me anytime, if you need some added support or just to vent or just to chat 🤙🏼"
rel_1891634,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,376,"Yeah I think it was a reality check for me because I was pretty shure that I'm trans (well which other male fantasizes about being a girl since youth) but I fled myself into escapism and denial. I tried to transition and presented in girlmode to all my friends but I didn't have the courage to just embrace it with girl-name and all that stuff because I fear it all might look and sound ridiculous. So I think I got into the position that I try to be brother/sister, friend, bf/gf to everyone in one person if that makes sense. In the past I noticed that I always had long platonic relationships with girls which is pretty unsusual for a guy. I fell in love with some but never did anything about it until it was too late. And when they showed interest in me the weird part was that I lost interest in them. With guys there is only some fearful curiosity thing going on. I mean I thinkg I get more along with guys because I was socialized as one. With said female friend I outed myself as trans as soon as I got to know her but although we basically just did girls stuff like busing clothes and learing make-up she still sees somewhat as a guy. And I'm so busy with being nice to her that I totally lost track of my desires and when they began fucking each other I instinctively knew that being so deep in denial is wrong. I mean I could date and fuck a lot of guys now. That's way easier now as a transgirl but atm I fear guys because of stds and most of them don't seem attractive to me. Unlike girls which I look after more but I dunno which cisgirls wants to date a tranny.... But somehow I'm also a bit into my male friend with which I imagined a realtionship before... but just the fact that they are attracted to each other although they know themselves for a shorter time than I know both I think I got triggeret because I think if I was cis it wouldn't be that way and I at least would have someone else as a partner..."
rel_25705771,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,230,"As a person who used to do this  i know a few things.
First of all when you get that tired/stressed you are already too late.
Learn to recognize what stresses you or gets you exhausted and adjust beforehand. For me for example it was working nightshifts, getting too little sleep, eat to much sugar to stay awake, having to prepare my children and take them to school. On top of that grieving for a dying and eventually dead parent made me explode a few times.
Changing my job, getting counseling and healthier eating helped me be less tired/stressed/overwhelmed. And i could communicate my state of mind better.
Still not perfect, i admit but i can deal with my flaws now and feel less depressed.
Second when you are already on the verge of exploding express to your ""victim"" where your anger is coming from. Say it is not their fault you are angry. That you are in that moment incapable of dealing with yourself or the situation calmy. Ask them to leave your presence, or you go take a walk or take the energy out on the sofa pillows, your bed or something else soft and sturdy, preferably an inanimate object....
Screaming is also very helpfull, but quite scary if you find yourself in the presence of living creatures, so best done when you are alone somewhere...
Good luck."

I have to assume he isn't serious about divorcing you and is probably being extremely dramatic. If I were you I'd probably just go vote. Personally I don't vote. I got my voters card just after last election then moved to a new state and have yet to get one for the new state I'm in plus I really just don't care.

But dude...what he did is fucked up regardless. He’s putting you through a ton of pain for his own pleasure. He didn’t even have the courtesy to ask if you were okay with it; he’s lying to you and going behind your back. 

You have to stand up for yourself, if only to teach your bro what he’s doing is selfish. The very first, bare minimum step is indicating to him how you feel. Tell him 1) you know and 2) you feel betrayed. I’m not saying excommunicate your brother or force them to break up, I am saying you should tell him what he’s doing is out of line.

I don't feel a strong, passionate inclination to be with her again which is what's holding me back...but my intellectual brain is telling me to get back together with her.

rel_37811086,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,270,"Well you’ve pretty much pinpointed two possibilities: she is either shy and hiding, or avoiding you. Do you ever talk to her? Have you ever said anything indicating you’re attracted to her? Do you stare at her for long periods of time?

I’m a shy girl. Well, I’m 24 now so I’m not shy anymore but back in high school I was. I used to do this to avoid boys, I didn’t want confrontation and it was easier to pretend I wasn’t there. Whenever I liked somebody, I made it a point to pass them a lot and know their classes. I wanted them to notice me, and would even sometimes wait around and talk to friends until my crush appeared than I would make sure they saw me. 

One time, there was a kid I wasn’t interested in who always tried to walk with me after class and I would try to leave so quickly but he caught up with me one day. He asked me to go for coffee, and I had to awkwardly say no. It was the hardest thing for me to do, and the rest of the school year was difficult for me. 

Sometimes hiding is easier than the possibility of rejecting someone. 

But some girls (a rare amount) do hide from crushes. Maybe she didn’t like her hair that day, or felt insecure about something. 

It’s hard to know which possibility this is, but I would wait for her to come to you just to be safe. If she doesn’t, than she’s probably not interested. If she does, you will be able to tell!"

He also calls me 'beautiful'' just because.

It's casual comments, for me at least, that really helps keep me on steadier ground because it doesn't feel like he's taking pity on me and my shitty confidence and is instead saying those things because he finds me attractive.

Also (maybe TMI, I don't know) he grabs my ass or goes for a titty grab when we're alone, which is a bit of a boost too, not for everyone."

rel_19613528,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,265,"For me, in school, the pressure was high to get a girlfriend. This was like a badge of honour that meant that you were “normal”. Basically, the societal norms that we feel every day throughout life, but when we’re young the effect can feel really intense.

However, we can either end up in long term relationships or flipping from one relationship to another whilst we’re young and it’s quite likely that our personality hasn’t fully formed.

So finding yourself, as a term, meaning knowing absolute everything about yourself. How you act and react to and in different scenarios? What gives you and extreme high or an extremely low? Who are you in uncomfortable scenarios? What are your core values and how do you act when those values are under threat and what are those triggers that make you feel that way? So essentially, we don’t rely on a romantic partner to be happy or comfortable. We don’t want to get ourselves into a position where we need to be with someone as it’s a catalyst for disaster. Your happiness needs to come from you. Happiness, when coming from any external influence is unsustainable and ultimately means it’s out of your control. 

That’s what finding yourself means. Being happy on your own and being happy with who you are. Firstly accepting yourself, positives and negatives alike and really understand what makes your brand. That way, anyone who becomes your partner in future will enhance your life authentically and not cover your dissatisfaction or lack of clarity you have with the core fundamentals of who you are."

Leave the door open *just* enough that when they actually ""grow up"" and get a taste of the real world that they can come back groveling to reconnect. You don't need to respond necessarily to requests for money or any abuse.

My step dad had this same relationship with is biological children, and I saw his heart break a little each time when he realized they only contacted him for money, every. single. time.

He really loved his kids.

When he died they tried to make out they were the ""victim"" because they didn't have a relationship with him. I've never cussed a person out as much as I did these people, I told them exactly what they did to him.

Not a single contact was for anything other than money. They never accepted invites for social contact, and never said ""I love you"" to him.

rel_17463747,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,357,"""Figure your shit out"" is something one says to a drug addict that consistently relapses and doesn't see the gravity of their actions; it is not something a partner says while throwing a symbol of unity and lifetime teamwork and togetherness during a hissy fit. Telling you to ""figure your shit out"" relays how she feels about the relationship. You must support her entirely but she is not obligated to reciprocate. What would her reaction be if the roles were reversed? Does she understand that marriage is a symbol of unity and telling you ""figure your shit out"" places all of the pressure and burden on one party which is the exact opposite of unity? I would think very hard about how comfortable I am with the reality that anytime there's a hurdle my partner resorts to chaos, panic, drama, and disrespect. If that isn't addressed in some intense way, there is no way that ring won't be given back in the inevitable divorce settlement. The relationship simply cannot last if this isn't resolved. It's understandable for her to be a bit stressed but her prime focus needs to be supporting you and encouraging you in your job search. That is what a relationship is. You build each other up and comfort one another during hardship. If she isn't doing that then there is a lot of work to do before that ring has a permanent place on her hand. The situation sounds bizarre but your calm demeanor suggests you may be desensitized because this type of thing is a frequent occurrence. If that is the case, weigh the pros and cons. Is it really worth it? It sounds pretty fucking exhausting. I hate that you're having to deal with this, OP. Find a way to address it or leave the rubble and move on. Life is hard; make sure you aren't making it harder by tolerating unfair responses. You don't deserve the reaction you got from her.

Each time it felt crushing. Each time I legitimately wondered if I'd be alone forever. 

Well, I won't wallow in glee over the relationship I'm in now because sometimes that sucks to hear about when you've just gone through a breakup, but I did finally meet someone who completes me.

As it turns out, I think, you *have* to go through awful things like breakups before meeting the right person. I've reflected on the nature of my relationship with my wife, and I think that it works so well because we've both been through a lot of the same awkward/sad/infuriating things that come with the death spirals of relationships. We can laugh about them, now, but they hurt like hell when they happened. 

That ability to show each other your scars and laugh and commiserate over how ridiculous life is can be the foundation of a rock-solid relationship (in any way, not just romantically). 

In the end, every struggle and scar becomes a story, an interesting anecdote, or a funny joke. So suffer now while you have to, and suffer well, because there will be a day when all that suffering pays off and you find that it has made you stronger, more interesting, and more equipped to have better, fuller relationships. 

The cost is pain and time. But the value is worth it."

I want you to know these things-

This is not your fault.  Your parents are making bad choices.  

You and your sister are special and important to God and have a destiny in this life. 

The ONLY thing you can control, is how you react to something.  

Get an education. Work hard and get out. Once you better yourself you can rescue your sister. 

I don't know if you know any members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints around you.  But if you know of some, pls safely seek them out, they can't save you, but you would have friends to help in ways that might make a huge difference. 

You are a child of a God who loves you. He knows your heart and what you struggle with. He can give peace in the midst of hell.

Open your heart to Him. Ask Him for strength and how to recognize opportunities to keep the peace.  

There is no wrong way to pray. Not as long as its sincere.  God sees everything. He sees our hearts and thoughts.  He is just waiting for you to reach out to Him. 

If I could rescue you and your sister and come raise you with my kids, I would.   I am very sorry this is your childhood.  But you will have the rest of your life. And you, like me, will break the cycle of abuse."

Frankly I would be more upset if someone told me as a joke or a side comment because I would feel like it’s something that they presumed is not a big deal which, maybe to him, it is. 

After the initial reveal has happened its okay to joke about it but it is a big announcement. That being said, I would reveal it when things /begin/ to get physical. Maybe you two are making out on the couch and you stop him and say, “Listen, before we go any further there’s something you should know about me...” To me that would be the best way to announce it to him because you both are on the same page physically and yet he knows early enough to break it off if it’s something he’s not comfortable with. "
rel_20493961,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,822,"**I just feel so emotionally drained.** 

Uranus, if you have been dating a pwBPD for 1.5 years, consider yourself lucky that you're only feeling *""emotionally drained.""* A large share of the abused partners become so utterly confused they feel like they may be going crazy. 

Because pwBPD typically are convinced that the absurd allegations coming out of their mouths are absolutely true -- they generally have a greater ""crazy-making"" effect than can ever be achieved by narcissists or sociopaths.

This is why that, of the 157 mental disorders listed in the APA's diagnostic manual, BPD is the *one most notorious* for making the abused partners feel like they may be losing their minds. Therapists typically see far more of those abused partners -- coming in to find out if they are going insane -- than they ever see of the pwBPD themselves.

Nothing will drive you crazier sooner than being repeatedly abused by a partner whom you know, to a certainty, must really love you. The reason is that you will be mistakenly convinced that, if only you can figure out what YOU are doing wrong, you can restore her to that wonderful sweet woman you saw at the very beginning.

**Yes, she focuses her anger on me and close family members.**

The vast majority of pwBPD are ""high functioning"" -- i.e., they typically hold jobs and generally get along fine with coworkers, clients, casual friends, and total strangers. None of those people is able to trigger her fears of abandonment and engulfment. There is no close relationship that can be abandoned and no intimacy to trigger the suffocating feeling of engulfment.

Hence, with most pwBPD, the strong BPD symptoms usually appear only when someone makes the mistake of drawing very close to the pwBPD. This is why it is common for high functioning pwBPD to excel in very difficult jobs such as being a social worker, nurse, teacher, surgeon, actor, or salesman. And this is why most pwBPD can be considerate and friendly all day long to complete strangers -- but will go home at night to abuse the very people who love them.

**We’ve actually broken up a few times before but... we always get back together.** 

Uranus, BPD relationships are notorious for having multiple breakups. A *BPD Family* survey of 600 such relationships found that 21% went through 10 or more complete breakup/makeup cycles BEFORE finally ending for good. About 40% of them experienced at least six full breakup/makeup cycles before ending. And 73% had three or more breakup/makeup cycles before finally ending. See ""Results"" at [Breakup/Makeup Poll](http://bpdfamily.com/message_board/index.php?PHPSESSID=61cfea90d5baeaffa15c7f867e2bb854&amp;topic=120215).

Most pwBPD are good and caring individuals. Their problem is not being BAD but, rather, being UNSTABLE. Indeed, a pwBPD typically exhibits the warmth, spontaneity, vulnerability, and purity of expressions that otherwise are seen only in young children.

As any parent can tell you, young children are VERY EASY to fall in love with. It thus is not surprising that 3 of the world's most beloved women -- Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland, and Princess Diana -- all had full-blown BPD if their biographers are correct.

Indeed, it is this childlike behavior that makes most pwBPD very hard to walk away from. Because you are essentially in a parent/child relationship, leaving is so painful because it feels like you're abandoning a young child who -- despite her frequent rages and temper tantrums -- must dearly love and need you.

**I don’t really know what to do or where to go from here.** 

Again, I suggest you see a psychologist -- for a visit or two *all by yourself* \-- to obtain a candid professional opinion on what you're dealing with. Whenever strong BPD warning signs are appearing, it is important to see YOUR OWN psychologist, i.e., one who has not treated or seen your GF.

In that way, Uranus, you're ensured that the psychologist is ethically bound to protect YOUR best interests, not hers. I mention this because therapists generally are loath to tell a high-functioning pwBPD the name of her disorder. They often decide that it is not in her best interests to be told.

Of course, learning to spot BPD warning signs will not enable you to diagnose her issues. Although strong BPD symptoms are easy to spot, only a professional can determine whether they are so severe and persistent as to constitute a full-blown disorder.

Yet, like learning warning signs for a stroke or heart attack, learning those for BPD may help you avoid a very painful situation -- e.g., remaining in a toxic relationship or running into the arms of another woman just like her. Learning the red flags also can help you decide when professional guidance is needed.

I therefore suggest you take a quick look at my list of [18 BPD Warning Signs](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9hv2yq/what_are_the_primary_warning_signs_for_bpd/) to see if most sound very familiar. If so and you have questions, Uranus, I would be glad to discuss them with you."
rel_30206741,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,254,"She definitely made mistakes, and has annoying / uncool opinions and behaviors. Most people do, but also I don't want to go invalidate the ways that she's hurt you. 

It's pretty standard to get older and then see the flaws in your parents, so don't feel bad about that! Hell a lot of people with perfectly fine parents will go through a *hating mom and dad* phase.  

I've been through some of this, here's my advice:

Unless she's really abusing you, don't burn bridges with her. Maybe take a break, but whenever possible show kindness and respect.... She won't always be here, and it hurts to think back on times you showed cruelty to your parents after they're gone. 

Maybe try to find a way to gently talk with her about things? Not everyone can handle these kinds of discussions, and it ends up wrecking your relationship. Sounds like she might be one of those, if she's a Little Miss Can't Be Wrong type. Maybe work with a therapist on this?  

So many people will tell you to cut her off, she's a racist so just throw her away, etc. This is wrong. She's your mother and although she's flawed and made mistakes she loved you, raised you, and gave you good values and habits. You only get one Mommy!  So try to make it work... obviously you are because you are here trying to work it out. Good work!

In my eyes, I see that supporting him \*is\* the way to have him more. (the way I think about it, if I helped, and it worked, he'd feel better and he'd be around more often, but I quickly came to the realization that I simply can't always help. He knows about himself and his health more than I do. I can only help him with what he tells me, which may not be everything.)

My position is more realistically like waiting for him to come out of the dark. Because I simply can't pull him out.

Yeah he's said similar things before. Things about the pain of just \*being\*.

OP has said she has done willingly, eagerly and so far, without complaint. OP hasn't communicated with him that she is in any way unhappy with the amount they're having already.

When I read the paragraph copied, I took it as him waiting until she was awake to start a conversation about something that has been on his mind for a while and struggling to put into words, which is why he didn't have sex when she tried to initiate upon waking. 

I didn't see it as some retaliation for her not having sex immediately when he wanted it. 

I don't see that saying you would like to have more sex is abusive or manipulative either. Even if there is a lot of sex happening already. 

I would say his response to being told about OP's feelings would reveal if he was actually abusive, but so far...I wouldn't go there. Like, if after hearing how she really feels about it, he tries to push her for more sex and doesn't want to compromise, absolutely."

On the other hand, you could really go with the ""I said what I said"" and deal with the consequences of your actions. TBH I personally feel this is the best course of action, the other people being ""bad influences"" or not. You allowed your boyfriend to guilt you into this when your gut feeling was that it wasn't a positive thing. This is a learning lesson for yourself. Stand your ground and stand firm.

rel_37410357,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,324,"Profit, your GF's unstable behavior may be due to her having very weak control over her own emotions (i.e., a lack of emotional skills she had no opportunity to acquire in childhood). My exW has this problem. If that is an issue for your GF, you likely have been seeing 3 other warning signs.  
  
***First***, you would be seeing her rely heavily on black-white thinking, wherein she tends to categorize some people as ""all good"" (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me"") and will recategorize them -- in just a few seconds -- from one polar extreme to the other based on a minor infraction.  
  
Because she also uses B-W thinking in judging HERSELF, she would rarely acknowledge making a mistake or having a flaw. Doing so would imply, in her mind, she is ""all bad."" She thus would blame nearly all misfortunes and mistakes on you and view herself as ""The Victim.""  
  
Further, to validate her ""victim"" status, she would keep a detailed mental list of every infraction/mistake you ever did (real or imagined) and would not hesitate to pull out the entire list to defend herself in the smallest, most insignificant disagreement with you. Moreover, this B-W thinking also would be evident in her frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions like ""you ALWAYS..."" and ""you NEVER....""  
  
***Second***, you would not see her expressing her anger to casual friends, classmates, or total strangers. She usually gets along fine with them. Rather, her temper tantrums almost exclusively would be expressed against a close loved one (e.g., against you or her parents).  
  
***Third***, you are convinced she truly loves you. But you often see her flipping, on a dime, between Jekyll (loving you) and Hyde (devaluing you), frequently making you feel like you're ""walking on eggshells."" Such flips would occur in a few seconds in response to some minor thing you say or do. 

Profit, have you been seeing strong occurrences of these 3 red flags?"
rel_594673,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,285,"&gt; if you hang on long enough, and make sure you're always dependable, comforting, and out of the way when needed, there's no way she won't end up with you.

I think that thought has gone through the head of every person that has posted on r/relationship_advice hoping that their friendship would magically turn into something more serious because they're the ""nice guy"".  And it can end badly for you.  Because there are lots of people who post on this problem that get caught in this holding pattern for **years**.  Years of being the nice, dependable guy that she can always run to in between boyfriends, but never actually date.  And a lot of them are genuinely nice guys, who are hung up on one girl, and missing TONS of other girls that are willing to actually make them a priority in their life.  So to me, the worst part isn't that she could get back with her ex, it's that you hang on to this faint hope that hopefully, maybe, some time she'll come to her senses and see you as boyfriend material, while life and love passes you by.  It's a nice concept in movies and TV shows, but not in real life.

I get that you have blinders on for her right now, so the best advice for you right now would be to lay it all out.  Tell her how much you care about her, and that you want a relationship, then see what she says.  If she can't give you a straight answer, or claims to still not be over her ex, **move on**.  She can't be the one that got away if she was never ""yours"" to begin with.  "

I’ll be 30 this year and I still haven’t decided- don’t let your friends and acquaintances around you that are getting married/having kids make you feel pressured. This isn’t something that can be easily decided for sure. 

There’s this huge social pressure to have kids, but the reality is it just isn’t for everyone. Kids change your life FOREVER. It will never be the same again. It’s a lifetime commitment of bringing up a tiny human the best you can, and everything else becomes second priority. 

The idea of having kids does occasionally appeal to me. That unknown feeling of parental love and watching a child grow under your care, that sort of stuff. 

But then I remember just how much more I want to do with my life. I haven’t even started what I truly want to do as a career thanks to financial and networking roadblocks. I know if I had a kid now, all of that would have to be pushed aside. 

The freedom of not being a parent is huge. I know a lot of older couples that never had kids and are super happy. It’s a shame how many people think having kids is so crucial to have a fulfilling life.

Men and women evolved with different values and roles, and their intuitions will reflect that. Up until fairly recently, it was to the man's great advantage to keep his woman chaste - how else would you guarantee you're the father? There were no paternity tests. Naturally, you'd expect them to care more about sexual history -- but it gets perceived as wrong, especially on this sub. That's easy to say as a woman - there are no reproductive consequences if you man wasn't chase historically. Imagine I take a value women often held, like their man having a stable job and income, and when a woman complained that ""her husband lost her job and lounges around, she finds him very unattractive, etc."" reply: ""hey, I wouldn't mind if my gf did that, you shouldn't either."" I wouldn't say that, because it's generally understood that through our history a man's ability to provide was of great importance, and my not valuing that in a woman doesn't indicate it's rightness in the reverse case.

I'm in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend (we started dating in January and have met up a few times in person) we now haven't seen each other for almost 10 weeks. I'd worried at first that we would run out of things to talk about but it hasn't happened yet. Some conversations are a bit 'samey' as we talk about our days etc, but we also found a long list of questions online, and have been working through them. One of us will just pick a random number and we'll each answer whatever that question is. It's a low-key way to get to know each other better, and gives us things to talk about without having to think up the subject ourselves! We also found a random quiz to do together. You can also play games together if gaming is your thing (it's not ours!) or as you're already doing, you can watch shows and films together.

Also change your passwords and make sure your accounts are signed out of any devices other than the one that you are using at that moment. 

You're not stupid, you're not an idiot, you're not selfish or seeking attention. You're dealing with a very difficult situation that most people have never experienced; abuse gets its hooks in deep and changes our perception of what is and is not normal or permissable. I want you to know that this stranger is so proud of you for recognising that what's going on is not okay and for not ignoring that feeling."
rel_17417488,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,399,"Wow. That's a lot to unpack. You have expressed yourself well.

It sounds like your family does have the traditional Asian structure, where your mother will ALWAYS view you as the child, your place in the family is set and cannot change. 

They have raised you to be strong, independent and successful. But they also want you to be dutiful. Those two things are in direct conflict in this instance, because in order to  fulfil your mother's idea of 'duty' you will have to step into the child role again, which you know is stressful and will make you unhappy.

The COVID situation does complicate things, as you say, because once you move there you will be stuck.  
My advice would be to try to find a way to connect and support them more without actually physically being there. Can you perhaps make arrangements to facetime your Dad and chat once a week or some other form of communication that allows for greater connection?

I do think if you move back that you will regret it. Because you will be giving up much of what you have worked for, with no guarantee that you will be able to replicate it. 

In the end, this is your decision - it's a values choice, in a way. Only you know what the cost is. If the worst happens and your father passes without you going back, will your mother hold it over you and guilt trip you? Will you be comfortable in yourself that you have made the right choice?  
But if you move back to live with them, is is possible that your relationship with them will deteriorate to the point that you want nothing more to do with them? In which case you have sacrificed a lot for nothing of value. I notice that you do not mention your relationship with your father, only your mother. Who would you be going back for? And would your presence there make an appreciable difference to the quality of their life? Because if it is only to 'be there' for the sake of it, there is as much potential disaster as gain.

Can you, in any way, say ""I love you but if I live with you there will be no harmony in the house"" ? You are an adult now, not a child, and will have trouble living under their rules."

Not only did she lie to your face about hooking up with someone else, she’s been manipulating and threatening you throughout the course of your relationship. But look man, you did the exact same thing. You broke up with her just to show her what it would be like to lose you, then got back with her immediately. The only reason her behavior hasn’t started back up is because she knew that she fucked up by getting with someone else and lying to you about it, so she needs to stay in your good books... for now.

And your response made my day, I’m so glad that you appreciated my comment even though I wasn’t able to provide a solution. 

I just want to echo your sentiment that having ED doesn’t make your husband *any* less of a man or indicate *whatsoever* that he’s somehow failing at masculinity, but I know how hard it is to not be affected by societal expectations for each gender. It’s great that he has a supportive partner like you. I hope he knows that there are plenty of people wise enough (including in this very thread) to know that his inability to get hard easily doesn’t dictate his maleness. Still, knowing something on a rational level doesn’t always equate to really *feeling* it, ya dig? 

I hope it doesn’t come across as odd that I seem so invested in this. Your comments just stood out to me because I’m a trans man and witnessing stories about men struggling with feeling that they’re lesser men because of things that are totally normal and/or entirely out of their control really tugs at my heartstrings (plus I figured my consequential knowledge of HRT could prove useful haha). 

I don’t know if the ED is something that actually weighs on him heavily or if he regards it as more of an inconvenience, but for the former, r/MensLib is an excellent subreddit for things like that. It really helped me to read &amp; talk about men’s issues in such a nontoxic forum that’s open to everyone. Body image/sexual performance concerns are frequent topics of discussion. Anyway, I don’t know if this is something that would appeal to him at all, just putting it out there as a potential resource. :) 

Again, good luck with everything. Wishing you and your partner many more years of happiness and intimacy. Seems like you two got a good thing going on!"

You feel that way because that's what he's doing. It'd be one thing if he was putting in the effort but he isn't. This isn't a healthy relationship. You're his caregiver at this point.

I think focusing on getting her help with that will help get things going with the relationship again. Im worried about her once you leave,, too. Having her work on personal projects is a great start. Does she get exercise? Working out can help tremendously. Does she see a dr or therapist? She needs to. And what are her goals? She's not working? Set a goal to have her apply to one new job a day. That will give her time each day to get her resume customized for each application. She isn't getting the job she wants? What would help her be a better candidate? Get her working on learning or getting certs or anything that can help. 

She sounds a little lost right now. Not having goals, not accomplishing anything, not headed in any direction can feed depression and make her life feel meaningless like it's not going anywhere. 

This may not be what you were looking for, but it's clear you love her and don't want to break up.

Or perhaps you don't really love your partner but feel like you should.  She maybe ""perfect on paper"" but there's no real substance there and even though you should be madly in love,  you're just not.  

If it were me, I would do some deep diving into what's going on my mind.  The only thing I wouldn't suggest is to cheat and see what happens.  If your partner is as lovely as you make her seem,  you won't want to break her heart twice (once for the cheating  one for the goodbye). Before you go near this other woman,  break up with your current,  if that's what you decide to do.  

Also keep in mind that the other one is forbidden,  new and still an exciting mystery so she probably really excites you. And you're only seeing the best of her atm. It's easy to mistake this for passionate love. But after being with her for a while, this will fade and fade quickly. Then you're left with just who the other women is, so you want to hope that you really like her as well.

rel_7339657,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,440,"First off, you have my sympathy for having to go through this type of hardship.  I'm sorry.

I'm not going to tell you what you should or shouldn't do in terms of staying with your husband or leaving.  This stuff is complicated and adulting is hard.

However, as a former piece-of-shit cheater, you need to recognize that your husband's behavior is compulsive.  It is, in some sense, not under his control. That doesn't mean you should accept it or normalize it, but it does mean that, until he gets his shit together - **which is a process that is going to take him a lot of work, and probably years** \- *trust has to be off the table*.  You can't *trust* him to manage his shit until he *demonstrates*, over a long period of time, that he can manage his shit. My advice is that if he seriously wants to make your marriage work, he needs to submit himself to radical disclosure about where he is, what he's doing, and who he is doing it with, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  This means you have all his passwords to all of his email accounts and devices, and you mutually agree that you looking at them isn't ""a betrayal"" but is just *business as usual and part of making the marriage work*.  It means that he leaves ""Find My iPhone"" on and shares his location with you at all times.  It means if he stops off for coffee on the way home with a friend, he calls you before he does it and tells you when and where and who, and makes sure it's ok.

He may not be willing to do that.  That's fine!  That just means he doesn't really want to do the work, in which case you need to figure out how to separate to protect yourself.

Your husband needs therapy - not just couples therapy, but something like cognitive behavioral therapy so he can learn how to manage his shit without continuing to trash his entire life over a crush.

Lastly, and this one is a little controversial:

*He can't have female friends.  Period.*

That is not a reasonable restriction to put on a normal man in a normal relationship with a good track record. It is, however, a reasonable restriction to put on a piece-of-shit cheater who has shown himself willing to lie to you and gaslight you about his crushes.  Frankly, where he is right now, you can't trust him to drink a glass of water without drowning himself, let alone manage having female friends and not lie to you about it."
rel_36900284,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,322,"If he's saying that your weight could be an issue for him in 2 years or something that's bad. Love is about friendship and attraction/sexuality.

That weight doesn't matter, or only matters a little, or sex needs to be less frequent, or more frequent.... etc.etc. If you wouldn't hold your fiance to the same body standards than you guys are incompatible.

It seems you have a lot of trouble with body image and self hatred. If I were you, I would look into learning about the body neutrality movement. Follow creators and influences who look like you and look like regular normal humans with weight, ability, culture, gender, etc. than you. Crutches and Spice has helped me unlearn a lot if internalized fat phobia I've had against myself. 

You are someone who matters, who is much much more than your weight and shape. You deserve happiness and your beauty comes from you being you, it comes from the essance of your being and not from the package you are in. Everyone I know, of all weights, look best when they are happy in their lives. Dieting and exercising because you hate yourself will make you feel miserable. Thinness does not equate beauty or happiness. Ever. What matters is that your body houses you and that you feel okay in it. Your lifestyle choices should be made to have you feel happier, more energetic, and comfortable. Weight is something that will change and fluctuate. Your outer beauty is for you and you alone, whether that is weight, clothing, makeup, hair, etc.

There are men who will love you for you and your body even regardless if it looks the same the entirety of your life. We all will grow old, have weight change, and look different over time. It is life. A happy person is someone who accepts that."

id be totally shocked if there was no sexism involved at all - there are almost always elements of sexism at play in a situation like this - male dominated industry, only woman there, etc etc, but that does not automatically explain why more serious actions were taken, like being the only one put on leave for covid or being removed from the workers staff house.

it could 100% be solely due to sexism, but it could just as easily be due to things like poor job performance or poor treatment of coworkers. its not uncommon AT ALL for people of all genders(and all walks of life) to preform poorly at a job, get fired or treated poorly in return, and make up excuses for themself about how they are getting treated poorly because someone has a vendetta against them, someone feels their position is threatened by them, someone is sexist or racist, all kinds of different stuff. 

nobody posting in this thread aside from OP actually knows why these things happened, so its hard to give good advice without specifics. for example, the issue about the womans bathroom being removed - what reason was given for why it was removed when she asked about it? is something being renovated which renders the bathroom out of order? do they have single occupant restrooms and simply changed mens/womens to gender neutral bathrooms? or did upper management seriously just sit down and say ""well fuck OP for being a woman lets close the womans restroom""? where does OP currently go to the restroom? the whole post is incredibly vague"

2. Does she make me happy? 

Be honest and give yes/no answers. Don't answer with ""yes, but..."" If the answer to each question is **yes**, then make it work. Otherwise, you know what you should do. 

You sound like a practical and analytical person, so you focused on your questions in your OP. As a romantic, these questions for me would be less important. Btw, there's nothing wrong with keeping your debts separate if it's the best way of keeping the *relationship* strong, as opposed to keeping you happy. Start focusing on the couple rather than the single. Would you be willing, for example, to support her while she works to repay her debts? If you both love each other and make each other happy, this is a really easy answer.

This is the big red flag for me as you present it too.

If she still blames them then she obviously still doesn't understand that if you aren't happy in a relationship, you leave. If a partner isn't living up to expectations you talk to them about it and if they still don't then you can walk away.

The fact that to her ''I'm unhappy, must take dick'' is her go to response to being unhappy in a relationship, rather than communication is very worrying. It's immature and toxic.

My gut tells me that you will be very happy with her until you notice she's a bit off and not quite as talkative, and by that point she'll be sleeping with somebody else. I'd even go as far as to assume that (given she's still shifting blame) she actually did cheat on her last bf and only told you she didn't cheat on him so it didn't seem as guaranteed."
rel_6247485,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,442,"I really hate to break this to you but this is a toxic relationship riddled with passive aggressive acts and manipulation. You’re gf is also a hypocrite...

Look, I dated the exact same type of girl you’re dating now when I was your age. It doesn’t work out the way you think it will. Mine ended with her getting into a situation where she was sexually assaulted while involved with drugs and alcohol.  After, I asked her not get involved with drugs because I was worried. She then returned to using drugs and alcohol a month later. They will not change, not for you or anyone.

Relationships are work, hard work. Much harder than most people think. You can love people but understanding and empathy come with time and tribulations. She has been through way too many bad or shallow relationships, and you have been through too few. She refuses to express how she really feels or even open up, yet here you are agonizing over what’s going wrong. You haven’t done anything wrong dude. You actively try to work at this relationship but you’re trying to change someone that doesn’t try to change themselves.

Things I noticed that were extremely toxic behaviors on her end:
1. She has begun distancing herself from you. She is not invested in this relationship. The whole part where she is telling you she’s scared you’ll leave her is manipulative. She will be over the relationship a month after its done and in a year would forget about it completely.

2. She told the counselors at school about your parents divorce. Something that by right should be yours to divulge, not hers. Its YOUR experience, not hers. I figure you probably didn’t want those counselors knowing, and by now they probably comment on it from the outside. It was extremely rude and disrespectful of her to tell uninvolved people your private business without your consent.

3. Her getting upset at you for not standing up for her, and then not standing up for you when you get upset. Entirely hypocritical.

All in all her actions are toxic. I would say run, but you’re in love and its hard to see people for who they’ve become. Don’t throw away your friends for this girl. Its a quick way to become very alone, very quickly. Sometimes your friends have a different perspective on the relationship that make you able to notice things more clearly.

At the end of the day, she’s taking advantage of your kindness and your inexperience. However, it is up to you whether you stay or not. Just don’t expect her to stay as well."

Sorry for the descriptive language, I'll keep it short. Me and my girlfriend have been dating for like 3ish months now. And we've been both trying new things in the bedroom. She's into getting dominated, and on multiple occasions she's expressed interest in being penetrated while she's asleep, and waking up with me inside her. And multiple times, she's explicitly told me that she wants me to try it and use her in her sleep. I was uncomfortable with the idea of trying it without consent, but she kept insisting it's something she wants to try. 

Anyway, last night I finally did. And I'm taking my time because obviously I don't want to hurt her. She wakes up just as I'm starting to push it in, (I didn't actually go in, just barely started) and she got so pissed. She pushed me away, went back to sleep. I assumed it was just because she's sleepy and got irritated that I woke her up. But even in the morning, she's visibly angry. She's telling me how it was messed up of me to try because she didn't give me permission... As if she didn't explicitly ask me? Wasn't the whole idea behind it that she can't give me permission, which is why she found it hot? 

What is happening here?"

Frankly (and hopefully I won't be lambasted as sexist for this) I feel that women are often better at some things (focus, organization, planning, etc.) then men and we could use more of that in engineering. 

You BF's friends were total dicks and IMHO, your BF was way wrong for not pushing back on them.

If I were him, with a hot girlfriend that shared the same career and hobby interests as me, I freely confess that I would be proud to show you off.  That being said, ""showing off"" does not mean parading you around like a prize pony that can do tricks.

If you speak clearly to him how his friends (and his) behavior made you feel and if at that point if he does not immediately recognize the error of his ways, then my advice would be for you to think long and hard about the future of your relationship with him.

This went on for about two years before eventually we mutually decided we weren’t compatible and should go back to being friends. We were best friends before we dated also so we still have this vibe that we care about each other and don’t want to lose each other so we still talk and hang out and stuff. It’s kinda nice right now because I get the space I wanted but I don’t have to lose her. I wish we coulda worked things out but with her not willing to give me the space I needed in the relationship, it couldn’t. 

I know I wasn’t able to offer much advice, because I frankly did not know what tf to do half the time, and looking back, just going with the flow of things and letting her know how I truly felt was the right course of action, I just wish I would have been honest with her sooner instead of trying to roll with the punches. It would have saved us both a lot of hurt. But after all it’s better for us to just be friends..I  hope this helps and I’m sorry you’re in this situation friend. Just stick it out and be honest with yourself and your partner and it will work out for the best. Hopefully you come to a conclusion that works out the best for y’all."
rel_28811484,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,241,"I really suggest not proposing and honestly consider leaving her and moving on to better yourself and find someone who won’t be sneaking behind your back… ive been cheated on so much and my last boyfriend honestly was my final straw with giving him chance after chance, it’s draining and if they truly wanted to have mutual trust and a real, loving relationship: they wouldn’t have even had a second “mistake”. A person who truly cherishes you and loves you wouldn’t even cheat a first time… when i finally stood up against my ex and ended it for the sake of my own self worth, it helped me find myself and become independent and end the toxic cycle of people who hurt me over and over again and excusing it with “but i love you and can’t lose you!” If they didn’t want to lose you, they wouldn’t push your boundaries and continuously hurt you again and again- and then expect you to be okay with it! i’m sorry for this little rant, and i’m not sure if it helped at all, but i hope that you end up doing what will make you happy and help you live a life without the self doubt and pain… you deserve respect and love and loyalty, don’t let anyone snuff out ur light. find someone that’ll want to grow with you as a team and shine bright together !

rel_18846415,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,253,"What she is doing is highly inappropriate and yes, emotionally cheating. Morning walks? Afterhour talks? Bring him to YOUR house with HIS kids and you not present nor ever met the guy? Cute conversations and emojis? FUCK NO dude. What's next? ""Working late""? Called in on the weekends? Office dinners &amp; parties you're suddenly not invited to but she doesn't come home til 5am (if you're lucky)?? Last minute ""business trips""? Put this fire out immediately. This is straight up limerance. You putting an end to this is not insecure, its not controlling, its not abusive, its not anything other than you protecting your family. Ask her if you did all that with a female coworker more attractive than her what her response would be. If you took time and effort away from her and your kids what would she do?

Edit: this sub is littered with stories of wives who made the same promises and assurances to protect their affairs. Don't be a victim and don't believe her shit.

Edit 2: find her secret apps &amp; emails. Snapchat, Whatsapp and kik are a cheater's paradise. Her immediate willingness to show you her texts may be a red herring. Check her app downloads on her phone or shared device. Check her car for a burner phone. His reactions tell me something more is going on there, and wives love to introduce AP's to their husband's in the hopes to ease your worries, or in some cases just to rub it in your face."
rel_2893439,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,242,"Be aware though, it isn't just that 'sometimes you are happy with things how they are', rather there is a consistent concern you have that there is too much risk being honest. In reality you'd jump into a relationship with her in a heartbeat if you were reasonable certain it would go ahead.

So ultimately you have to decide for yourself. A lot of guys call the 'friend zone' when a girl rejects them but keeps being friends while relying on them. But actually a lot of the time it is guys who are too scared to give up their friendship or are content with friendship rather than being honest or moving on that are in the friend zone. You have trapped yourself in it because you are scared. 

And fair enough, but just appreciate that if you aren't honest then you really will become the kind of friend she talks to about romance. Why? Because that is what you do with your friends and she has no reason to believe you aren't just a normal friend until you are honest. 

And you have to decide is the pain and confusion worth it. Yeah, I can see the 'appeal' of playing it safe but just remember that eventually those feelings will hurt too much or, more likely, she will get another partner and you will feel abandoned or betrayed. Rest assured those feelings hurt a lot more than finding a new friend. "

Why does the story just end with a dramatic closing mentioning pictures of your dead father? What happened with the wife, did you storm out or have a confrontation in your place?

You want effort, you feel you put in effort to show you care for him and that it isn't reciprocated. You point out all his habits, frivolous spending, and his exhaustion at hiking because it comes across to you like he just doesn't care (because he doesn't). It isn't about money, it's his attitude. You've expressed you want to feel appreciated and you don't feel appreciated. And his response is either to downplay it or say in any number of words ""that's how I am so get used to it.""  


It's not your job to fix him.  


You can't make him change, he has to want that for himself.  


You need to look out for yourself because staying like this is giving you a low opinion of yourself  


This kind of situation doesn't get better quickly if at all and I suspect you know this but are scared. Hoping it will and hoping he will change for you. That's unrealistic and a mental trap because if he doesn't and you're staying then you will start to blame yourself for not being good enough or doing something wrong in not fixing him.   


I can't make you do anything, but you could let him know you don't feel appreciated in the relationship and you need him to commit to changing his attitude and how he does things if it's going to continue. (personally I would have left but again I can't make you choose how I do things). Also maybe look into therapy if you can to see where this low self esteem comes from and unpack that."
rel_1999113,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,349,"Sounds like you need to talk to your older sister, Carly about how to handle it. I always find that this is the best step to take next at least before you end up going to your parents. But at least talk to her about how to bring it up to your parents without freaking them out.  

Then here's Option A: you need to sit your sister, Caitlyn, down and talk to her like an adult. I know she's 16 and probly acting stupid as hell and crazy in love with this dude with the sick truck. But if you talk down to her she'll latch onto him for dear life and never let go until she's knocked up and he books it back to his wife. If you do nothing she'll keep seeing this guy until she figures out he's not leaving his wife. He's older knows he's manipulating a young girl and even is trying to see how far this can go without getting caught by Wifey. You know this as much as the next guy. Dudes a creeper. Shut it down fast. 

Option B: Tell Wifey. watch his world dissintegrate. It could backfire on you and he could leave her and double down on your lil sis. (Double down sounded dirty my bad.) So you might have to end up telling your parents anyways to make sure she stays away.  

Option C: I grew up in Paterson, NJ too. I'm pretty sure you can find a few less than upstanding citizen friends or friends of friends (you would be surprised the help you can get when you explain your situation to other dudes preferably those with sisters) These dudes can help you ""persuade"" this d-bag to never go near your sister again. Nothing illegal is necessary just enough guys to scare him. Maybe bring a bat maybe take out a headlight maybe a kneecap. Depends on how glib the bastard seems and how responsive he is to your ""persuading""

TL;DR Tell your older sister, then your parents. Kneecap the fucker. Jersey style

That being said, if this is a ""yellow flag"" for you, then it could just as easily be a red flag for him. That's also probably why he is being short.

That is the problem. You're not being an asshole you aren't being demanding you aren't being controlling.

Enough to suggest that it is actually a trend?

None of the three articles you presented portray the porn industry as being rotten to the core like you claim it is. But I digress. My position is simple and requires no backflips. Rape is wrong, when it happens in porn it is wrong, but the simple fact that it can happen doesn't then make anyone who watches porn an abuser.

You on the other hand claimed that a majority of porn is non consensual, and that most men are clearly abusers because they watch porn. No the one doing the mental gymnastics here isn't me."

rel_36086955,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,361,"What if she uses it against me? I've been vulnerable with her in the past and she has taken those things and threw them in my face during arguments at later times. I feel safer behind a wall. If she doesnt know how insecure I am she cant exploit it later on down the road when she is upset with me over something. 

I do share some stuff, I try to, but nothing very substantial. I tell her funny things that happen and about when the personal lives of the coworkers of mine that she knows comes up during the day because she is invested in that stuff for the entertainment value. But I dont share about me though because if I let her in she could use those things to hurt me. She has before and so have others before her too. 

When I do share about myself I feel naked and ashamed and like I should have kept it to myself. 

Like if I shared things like ""I had to talk to the engineer today and he just went on and on about how dumb the management is and I just cant stand it when I have to listen to people bitch about things we cant change when we could just put our heads down, do our work, collect our pay checks and be thankful we get to go home at the end of the day with a government pension and benefits"" 

If I shared that kind of thing in feel like she would eventually use it against me to make me feel bad for not finding a better place to work.

Or if I shared that ""I feel like I dont do enough at work and my subordinates end up being the real productive ones. I get this sense that they resent me for it, or maybe I'm just being hard on myself"" I fear that she would then use that later in an argument to put me down by turning it into ""youre always hard on myself""  or ""you dont even like yourself"" because she has actually used such things in that exact way in the past."

rel_26246630,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,310,"Even if nothing sexual happened between them, most healthy relationships have boundaries that shouldn’t be crossed. A secret solo trip to the beach with someone your partner has never met is one of them.

He didn’t tell you about this trip because he didn’t want you find out about his new fling. If he had to lie and coach his friends on what to say to you, then he didn’t have good intentions. Either they were already messing around or he was planning to make a move on her (even if he hadn’t yet when the sisters arrived).

The slim chance that he didn’t tell you because they were just friends and he knew you’d “freak out” is also b.s. unless you’re the type of person to never let your bf have any female friends whatsoever. But here’s the thing: his actions would make most girlfriends upset. That sort of reaction would be expected from anyone whose partner announced their plans. His behavior just isn’t acceptable in a relationship. 

So unless you kept him on a tightly controlled leash and made him stop talking to girls entirely, you should not blame yourself for this. 

He could have planned a group surfing trip with his guy friends, you, her, and maybe even some of your friends if it was truly innocent. Then you could’ve gotten to know this girl too and assessed their friendship, potentially befriending her as well.

But instead your bf had to lie and break your trust. 

I’m glad you broke up with him, but I’m so sorry you had to experience this. Please be kind to yourself and get lots of support from family and friends.

If you wanna make a move just be yourself and don't act any different. Don't make a huge thing out of it. I would do following: Next time you see here at the counter talk to her. Just some small talk. And at the end you just casually tell her that you enjoyed the conversations and ask her if she maybe wanna meet some time. If she says yes, ask if it's okay if you give her your number (then she can text you, which is a little easier in my view). However don't be too sad if she says no.

rel_21556545,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,247,"I've been there, man.  
And you ABSOLUTELY need to slow down.  
One of the great big issues of the world is that feelings aren't always symmetrical. She doesn't necessarily feel the same way about you as you do about her after a week and a half(which is not a long time), especially given that she's still super young (you both are, but her even moreso) and therefore not super experienced with this department. She's probably still just testing the waters to see what's going on and if it suits her.  


I rushed things a bit in my first relationship (jumping to giving titles like ""boyfriend"" etc. after a very short time, etc.) and that caused it to end pretty quickly.  


If you've ever had someone aggressively try to be your friend more than you cared about trying to be their friend you'd know the feeling. Back off, keep it cool, and let her feel like she can relax with you and figure thigns out in her own time.  


She might end up deciding it's not for her, yes, but if she feels like your feelings or expectations for her are that much stronger than they are from her to you, she could feel pressured and uncomfortable or like something isn't adding up there and decide to back out. Letting her feel comfortable and letting her figure it out is not only your best bet, but more importantly - it's the healthy thing to do n this situation."

You need to realise that this is a form of emotional cheating and you need to act on that - yeah sure for your boyfriends sake- but for YOUR sake. It sounds like you’re sticking with your partner because you’re simply comfortable. I’m not saying you don’t love and enjoy spending time with your partner , but I wouldn’t be surprised if he could sense something is up.

If he doesn’t and he’s completely oblivious to your attraction for someone else, then bless his heart. Let him be with someone who doesn’t have a wondering eye anytime his partner enters a new relationship. Let him be with someone who adores him and him only. I’m not saying this can’t be you, but it’s not you right now.

You knew all along that this wasn’t friendship. It’s lust. Be real with yourself and do what you need to do to make yourself happiest in the long run. 

Ask yourself this:

If you woke up tomorrow in your own place, single and free to date. If you never met your boyfriend but had all the memories of being with him right up until this moment. If he never knew you existed and so he had no heartache in this scenario. Would you seek out your boyfriend and start a relationship? Or would you move on?

The thing we fight about the most is what the “right” way to do something is and of course there’s no winner there. Point is, we are a team. Your bf is not a teammate. He’s the weak one. He’s the one letting the family down. He’s not holding up his end. He’s failing. But he doesn’t want you to notice. So making you feel bad is his ammo. He wants you to focus on how you’re not strong but girl let me tell you something, having or wanting help does not make you weak. Knowing you need help and not seeking it out is weak. Getting help take strength. And right now let’s muster up some strength to get out of this abusive situation. Because that’s what this is. Black women are beautiful and strong and so are you.

So she let me stay. 5 years later we remarried. What I'm trying to say is there's nothing you could have done. The will to change has to come from the addict. I was lucky. You can't be expected to stay in a toxic relationship just so the other person doesn't commit suicide. To this day I feel horrible for everything I put my family through.

rel_10369856,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,419,"1) Before we met he was a very social person, I personally believe I made him more introverted or not as social because I’m very introverted and he says he doesn’t feel the need to go out unless it’s with me or if I also want to go somewhere/ hang out with people. He encourages me to make friends a lot of the time but it’s been hard since we don’t have a car. We spend a lot of time with each other’s family as well and have a good relationship with them. Although none of our friends and family know about any of the things I listed in my post unless we lived with them and they’ve seen the altercations. (Which were some friends but they were both our friends so I assume they just don’t want to pick sides which is understandable to me. And his friends do always look out for me/ are supportive whenever we get into fights) 

2) I wouldn’t say he thinks black and white at all, we have similar mindsets when it comes to meeting people and keep an open mind. Although he doesn’t like it whenever I talk to people who I’ve said liked me in the past (even if it was 4 years ago) but I feel the same way sometimes about females that have liked him in the past. He says the difference is that the men have liked me and the females I question did not like him. But I just don’t believe that and it’s contradictory in a weird way to me. 

3) He’s had emotional outbursts towards his friends this way but I don’t think its ever to the degree it’s been towards me. The only time he’s fought with another friend of his is when the friend tried to mediate the fight between us and it ended up going left. It wasn’t to violent but definitely some pushing around. 

4) I’m not %100 understanding of that last statement because I feel like lately the stress has been getting to us so any little thing could spark an argument. Like for example this morning he woke me up and said we had an hour to get ready for work, I was upset as he knows it usually takes me longer in the morning and I’m definitely not a morning person. I gave some attitude but I don’t think it gives him an excuse to say “your dumb ass” “stupid ass” “shut up you’re so fucking annoying”."

He took me on a nice brunch date, he bought me a bunch books, we went back to his apartment (we didn't do anything just watched a movie), went to the beach, and then at the end of the night he walked me to his car and kissed me goodbye. We didn't see each other for a week and he eventually invited me out again to a bar with his guy friend, we all went back to his apartment and just drank and tried watching a movie but we were all drunk and laughing too much, he was constantly trying to make out with me the whole night and I think he wanted more but I didn't want to go all the way. 

Anyways, come to find out from his drunk guy friend that the guy I went on the date with had a gf with the same name as me in a different state and she was supposed to be coming to visit him the day after this night and she would be staying with him for two weeks. Well I found her on instagram today and I have the urge to tell her but at the same time idk her and it's not like me and her bf had sex so should I even tell her? This guy told me they were broken up a week before he met me but I find that kinda hard to believe because they were so lovey dovey the day she came back and he was posting all over his snapchat with no shame! I mean I would want to know if my bf was doing this but idk their relationship."
rel_14616576,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,213,"I think you deserve better than being friends with a guy who honestly sounds like he wasnt interested in you in the end. Nah, you respect and love yourself more than that. Move on. Work on yourself. 

Do you have hobbies? Focus on those more. You can work on finding more friends. Volunteer at a shelter or in a youth group, or go on community hikes/runs, find something you enjoy and do it, especially if it involves other people. 

I think this guy isn't the right person for you. The right person wouldn't have texted you like that, they would have made an effort to stay in touch and get to know you better. My general motto when it comes to dating is that anything that seems to be saying ""no"" means ""no, not you, not ever"", even if it doesn't look like it. People are bad at rejecting others in clear ways and it leads to misplaced feelings that there could be more. If they change their mind that's ok, but I usually consider that relationship completely dead unless the person who rejected me makes a big effort to show that they are now ready to be more serious (even if I really liked them and it's hard to not give in)."
rel_20151159,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,390,"What else is she going to do? If you found out later, she knows you will definitely leave her then. So obviously she **HAS** to tell you now. Just because someone admitted to doing something wrong and say they feel remorseful, doesn't mean they actually do. What else is she going to say in that situation? That she doesn't feel remorse? Obviously she has to say the words that you want to hear at that point. 

She could've just walked out of that relationship, but nope. She HAD TO sabotage her Ex's life. The cheaters in the replies are defending her, huh? Lol. Saying that now she knows that it's wrong to cheat, so it's a learning opportunity. Fuck that. People Don't need to actually commit a crime in order to know that it will hurt other people. Are you seriously THAT Naive to think that she didn't knew it was wrong to cheat? Bullshit. She knew it was wrong and will hurt the guy. That's why she didn't just walk away from the relationship, she wanted to hurt him, and she did.

One reply said that people make mistakes. It WASN'T A MISTAKE. You think she opened her legs to another guy by mistake? She did it on PURPOSE, that's the point.

Yes, anybody can cheat on you, but atleast if you enter in a relationship with someone who never cheated, you atleast know that they still have the basic human decency to not do anything wrong yet. Yes, people change. I get that. But why take the risk? You know she did it before. And you are willing to forgive that behavior. What's stopping her from doing it again? Even if you leave her, by that time you will be emotionally attached to her and it will hurt you even more in the future. 

Another bullshit argument I saw in the replies was that just because they cheat, doesn't mean you can't have a relationship with them ever again, because they did not do it to you. It was someone  else. Would you be in a relationship with a rapist, knowing that he hurt someone else? I mean, *he did not rape* YOU, right? OR Would you leave your kids with a person who have previously molested children? I mean, *they did not molest* YOUR children right? Pathetic."
rel_12710141,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,188,"I've been in a similar situation before.  My ex from a long time ago told me after nearly a year of being exlusive that when we first met, she was still hooking up with her fwb, who wanted to be more than fwb.  Like we would go out on a date but we weren't physical yet, and then she'd go hook up with this dude who was in love with her.  I'm not sure how long it went on but it was probably for the first 2-3 weeks after we had met and started going out on dates.  After that, I could never get it out of my mind, and I felt completely disrespected.   Like you, all these things about the other person suddenly made sense.  I felt like I could never trust her again after withholding something like that from me for so long.  In my opinion, you're better off without him.  It's not worth the pain and anxiety of not being able to trust someone fully or wonder about other possible past actions.  There's plenty of dudes out there that wouldn't pull this shit on you."
rel_37925313,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,340,"This obviously is bigger than the Christmas party and subsequent events.  But to focus on the specific night, Life 360 or not, why is it a problem for you to have a night out?  Separately, while I’m completely on your side here which I’ll confirm later, why not tell your wife the plan?  I mean I logically get why you didn’t, but that’s obviously an inherent problem. 

You say your trust with each other is 100% but also that 100% of the time you go out it’s a problem. You think that’s 100% trust?

Here’s what you say; “independence is important and healthy in a relationship. I’m going out with the guys tonight. That’s the end of it. I’ll be home later and resume being a great father and husband.”

Stand up for yourself my friend. The thing is,
I can’t imagine this didn’t always exist. In saying that, you married her knowing she was like this. I realize that’s moot, but hey, here we are. Life isn’t over. 

Anecdotally, I’m a guy and I’m happily married. I have a toddler and an infant. My wife and my children are absolutely everything to me.  But insanely enough, there are at least three things that sometimes happen; first, my kids are asleep through the night, so when I go out I’m not missing anything.  I’m leaving my wife absolutely miserable watching whatever TV I don’t want to watch anyway. Second, my kids aren’t asleep, and my wife takes care of them as if it’s possible to do so when her husband isn’t around. Third, my wife goes out, and I take care of my children in the same non-difficult fashion. 

It’s not an “escape from real life.” It’s having fun every so often with friends. When we get home, we’re still happy (hopefully) husbands and fathers. Establish that. In all likelihood, you’re setting yourself up for a fight, given all evidence proving as much. So you need to ask yourself if this is how you want to live forever. Good luck."
rel_8737529,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,348,"Lol this is kinda hilarious. At you and your GF Caucasian by any chance? I'm asking because this doesn't sound like something people of color would do so lightly, but I may be wrong. 

If I were you, I'd say something like the following: 

""Darling, the risk immigrants, especially illegal immigrants who had to come to this country to pursue any chance at a good life, the risks that they face are very serious issues. Many people are suffering because of US politics. You've seen photos of children and even babies being kept in cages at the border and dying from horrendous conditions. You've seen news about how Arab looking US citizens have been ""deported"" to war zones for no good reason. You've seen hate crimes being commuted against these immigrants who often just want to live a peaceful life and not harm anyone. 

This is what the immigration crisis actually looks like. I do not have the face of a stereotypical immigrant who faces these risks and dangers every single day of there lived. In fact, do you realize that if you didn't tell anyone, no one would ever assume that I'm not American? 

I feel like you're making light of the immigration crisis by referring to how I make you worry about it. Even if you're not explicitly stating it, you're heavily implying and misleading your friends, and to be honest, I feel like they also judge me for playing along with you. I find it annoying and immature of you for saying these things online, and it makes me feel like you're taking advantage of my so called immigration status to seek attention and validation, and it feels so wrong to me, and I cannot for the life of me understand why you keep doing it. 

If you actually have legitimate concerns of me being deported or being an at risk immigrant, I'd like you to share them with me, so we can properly discuss your concerns. I can't stand feeling like a trophy that you use to earn PC points or attention or something."""
rel_12921519,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,222,"I wouldn't read too much into him wanting a break. I'm sure a lot of people are feeling that way right now and it's not exactly something you can bring up in the middle of a lockdown. Also the way he talks to his friends is his business. In private conversations you feel comfortable talking a certain way because they are private, so the ""tone"" is also none of your business because you weren't supposed to read it. If he's not exposing personal things or straight up trashing you, don't worry about it. 

The fact that he invited someone is the only thing here that I think you're justified in worrying about. It could easily be a guy, but he could also be meeting up with the other guys as a cover for bringing a girl. Who knows. The problem is if you confront him he's just going to say it's a guys' trip and he wasn't going to tell you about it until he figured everything out or something like that. You're really not getting to the bottom of anything and the only thing that comes of it is you read his personal conversation and he shouldn't be saying he wants to ""get away from you."" 

I say confront him but be prepared to not get full closure on this situation."

1) Recruit more men to their cause, there is power in numbers and that's what they really REALLY want.

2) Persuade other men that are on the fence about joining, have them learn about the ""true nature"" of women, lots of their posts and videos, etc. Is to get men to see women the way they see them, so that they can join, etc

3) A lot of these guys still have the urges to have sex and even sometimes find a women (although they call these women unicorns) talking about women the way they do helps them rationalize the monkey part of their brain to shack up with women.

rel_7218169,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,420,"My parents separated when I was about a year old. I don’t think my parents had the 50/50 split you do, but my father was still apart of my life when I was young but he didn’t stick around and my mother got sole custody. My mother met my stepdad before I turned 3 and he became my father. I called my stepdad dad and to me he was my dad not my stepdad. 

When I was 10 my mom sat me down and explained to me that my stepdad was my dad and that my actual dad wanted to see me again. At this point I was very confused and this changed the relationship I have with my stepdad. The first few times I saw my dad again he came to me, then I started going to see him which was difficult since he lived 8 hours away. My dads lifestyle was very different to my moms. I lived in a big city with my mom and my dad lived in a small country town. It was hard at first but I really enjoyed spending time with my dad we did things I didn’t do with my mom. 

A few years later when I was 14 my now stepmom and stepsister moved in with my dad. At the time I’d only see my dad once a year for 2-4 weeks so it was hard to adjust. When I was 15 and is went to see my dad he was working half the time I was there. He did week on week off shift work. My stepmom was also working so it was just me and my stepsister who is about 4 years younger than me at home buy ourselves most of the day. When my dad wasn’t working he didn’t have much time for me and just made me feel like he didn’t care about me so I left early and haven’t seen my father since. I’ve spoken to him a few times since and he knows how and when he can contact me. 

If you give up on seeing your daughter you don’t know what relationship you will have with your daughter. She might get angry at you because her mom says stuff about you but at the end of the day if you do things because you care about her she will see that. She won’t think that you love her because you let her be with her mother all the time she’ll think you abandoned her."

And no hanging out in groups. Email her and tell her (or better yet tell her in person) that you like spending time with her and want to take her to a movie or on a date and see how it goes. What you don't want to do is be friends with her because you will always have those feelings for her and they won't be returned if she is not interested.

It's not fair or healthy to expect her to always agreeable about everything, we all need a safe place to vent.

rel_12521781,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,266,"Wow. Very much overreacting. My wife and I like almost none of the same music or even the same tv shows! She’s very into Celine Dion and broadway musicals and mellow pop/folk music (though she had a scene phase in high school so we can meet on common ground when it comes to AFI, Panic! At the Disco and My Chemical Romance) whereas I am very much into indie, experimental post-hardcore and rockabilly. 

We meet in the middle when it comes to shows and movies. I sleep during the day so that’s when she gets to watch her mellow-dramatic dramas like This Is Us and Grey’s Anatomy and I stream my shows in the morning when I get home from work before she wakes up (All the Star Treks) and we mutually decide what to watch and do on days off. I’ll let her play the newest episodes of her over dramatic shows and she watched Star Trek: Picard with me. It works. 

All that to say, she’ll need to learn that it’s ok to have separate interests (even wildly separate interests) and still have a fulfilling relationship. It keeps things interesting and even though I don’t care one bit why Patrick Dempsey was written off Grey’s Anatomy, she does care and so I listen and take part and then she in turn listens to me drone on about the finer points of warp engines, EMH holograms and the Dominion War. I know she doesn’t care, but she lets me bore her endlessly with it because she cares about me and I care about that stuff."
rel_17579520,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,346,"I am thirty and in a healthy, happy, long-term relationship for the first time in my life. This is partly because I am queer and came out later in life, but also partly because I was choosing partners based on what was expected of me instead of what I wanted for myself. 

In my early twenties I got out of a truly terrible relationship. I ended up losing all of my friends and moving to another continent to rebuild my sense of self. At the time it was devastating and traumatic, but now the memory of that time in my life has completely faded. It's barely a blip on my radar. 

How I ended up finding and choosing the right partner, almost a decade later, was using that time to support myself. I learned to put myself first, and make decisions solely based on what I wanted and what I knew was best for me. I stopped letting anyone else influence me and even if I made mistakes I could own them as my own and learn what I needed to from the experience. 

I learned how to be happy on my own and how to take care of myself, which set a high standard for letting anyone new into my life. When I met my current partner (at a queer boardgame night) things very easily came into place. We had both taken time to be single, had done a lot of inner work, and were both committed to mainting our health and wellbeing as our top priority. Our values aligned and we respected each other's choices and sense of self, which built a foundation for a loving relationship with room to grow.

What I would say is trust your gut, feel your feelings, and prioritize your health and wellbeing above all else. If you hold these boundaries and understand the motivation behind the choices you make, the right people will come into your life and the wrong ones won't last. Stay true to your values and you won't regret any of the choices you make."

It doesn't have anything to do with the bible, she's using sex as a bargaining chip. She wants more out of the relationship and doesn't know how to have him commit more, so this is her poor and misguided step in the wrong direction.

&gt;The few times I have tried to bring this up with her since has led to an absolute bloodbath of an argument because she feels like I'm attacking her faith.

I'd stop bringing it up, I would NEVER argue with her about it again. Tell her you aren't okay without physical intimacy, and withdraw from her emotionally. 

She expects your emotional intimacy without giving you her physical intimacy. I would immediately move to give her less of my time.

Arguments are emotional, stop giving them to her. Become indifferent to the situation, don't budge. If she doesn't wise up and realize you require physical intimacy for a healthy relationship, dump her.  These are your standards, they are established and not to be bargained over. 

Otherwise you may as well be friends, because that's what she's asking you for. Be here to support my emotional needs but I'm not going to support your physical ones. If it doesn't change move on with your life.

In your fantasy, the single dating life is smooth. You go on tindr for a few days, you match with a few someone's, decide who clicks best, you go out for a coffee and click, a quick roll in the sack and you agree that that's all it's going to be. 


It's smooth. Even when things go wrong in your fantasy, it's still smooth. Oh a bad coffee date, ""sorry not my type"", ""I understand"" and the end. 


Real life isn't that smooth. You either have a serious lack of matches (male) or you get too much to handle (female). And everyone has their game face on, so you try to see whether you click before the coffee date, but you just can't, so you make a gamble on one person. 


And then it's the coffee date and they are sooo different. And in the beginning you are like, oh I just made a wrong gamble, but at the end you realise that the matching does nothing to give you a date that you actually connect too. 


Eventually you find someone that you do connect with and that does have the same idea in mind (let's bone) and then you find out that you have to educate them to be any good. So it's not a one night stand. And you don't actually like them that much to educate them to be good and have a crappy sex life in the meantime. Because good sex is having knowledge about each others likes.


And there are a lot of variations of issues depending on what your gender is. A man is going to have more issues with their matches not wanting one night stands. A woman is going to have more issues with men not putting in the effort because it's just a one night stand. 


And eventually you will have so many bad experiences. The date that started stalking you, the one date that was like super ok and then it turns out that they kiss by placing their open mouth over your mouth and sucking (I am NOT over that), the one where you both are awesome together but your schedules never match, the one that gives you a call after 3 months ""Oh btw, you should get tested"", ... It's messy.

We had our one year at the beginning of the month, and had to push the celebration back a couple of days because his friend was getting married and had a rehearsal dinner the day of our one year, and another day he had work.

Sit down with your ex-boyfriend and explain to him that you're trying to be understanding about his depression, and that because you want him to participate in your son's life and have a good relationship with him, you haven't thrown a legal hammer down on him.  Explain that your son needs love and stability.  He's also no longer a hapless infant who won't notice people suddenly intruding upon or disappearing from his life.

Then tell him that if he has any interest in being a father to his son, he has to step up to the plate *now*, not next year, not when your son's already attached himself to another paternal figure, and not when your son has had time to grow up and be resentful of his birth father's absence and lack of emotional or financial support.  Tell him that you're willing to set up any type of visitation or child support plan that is reasonable with respect to his time and financial situation.

Don't give him an ultimatum, but if he doesn't step up to the plate within a year, then you have every right to sue for full custody and direct deposit of child support.

What needs to happen is a frank and honest discussion with him.  He doesn’t get to minimize what happens.  He needs to understand that his actions make you feel uncomfortable.  He needs to know that your communal friends are noticing.  And he needs to recognize, in the moment, when he’s getting worked up.

I’d sincerely recommend counseling for him, and possibly for both of you as a couple to overcome.   His mean-streak is no joke."

Whether your girl did something or not here is COMPLETELY irrelevant. 0 meaning. What matters is what she _wanted_ to do. Which means, she met this random ass fucking guy, hung around with him at the beach in a bikini, hanging out alone and shit together, and finally even having the fucking audacity to call you and ask if he can sleep in YOUR house. You're not dumb, you had the right instinct, you know **exactly** where this was going to go. And they're going to meet in the future anyways, don't think this stops what was going on. She _wanted_ to invite this random man into your house and if you said yes she'd have been like ""Fuck yeah Brody come to my crib don't wake up my boyfriend""

If she accepted your boundaries in _this_ case doesn't matter, cause it's not the relevant part. The relevant part is that this girl is clearly hitting it off with this random ass hobo and if she's willing to lay it all to you like that in your face you have to wonder what she does that she doesn't tell you about.

Scrap couples counseling. Go to individual counseling for yourself. If it were up to him, he'd reconcile right away; it's you who is unsure, therefore youre the one who needs support and guidance towards finding your individual answer. Perhaps the situation has reached an impasse because you two were skipping to step 2 (working on us) when step 1 (working on me) is a prerequisite to the success of step 2.

I hit someone last night. I was going 50 mph on a dimly lit highway and struck a indigent man with my rearview mirror who was loitering past the curb. I don't know how it happened, but the EMTs confirmed that all he suffered was a swollen ankle. Not even a scratch. A few more inches and both our lives would have never been the same again. I'm also a mother. I'm so sorry for what happened. I'm so damn sorry, for everything and all of you. 

Please focus on  yourself, that will be the key to unlocking the door to the next chapter in your life. Leave everything and everyone else on the back burner while you rediscover who you are. The decision about your and his future lies with you. That's so fucking unfair. It's also how it needs to be: you have the ultimate final say on deciding where you both go from here, and no one should factor into the decision more than you. No one should even be close.

It could be that he's just under some extra stress right now or has issues that he's not sharing, but that type of sudden personality change can also be indicative of a health problem.  

Someone had suggested documenting it- if you can, if you hear him coming up the stairs to your room, turn on your phone and start recording before he gets into the room.  Having the audio may not help if things actually go to court, but it's not going to hurt your mom's case if she talks to a lawyer.  But be safe about it- if his behaviour has changed that suddenly you can't guarantee that he's not going to cross the line into physical abuse as well. 

As far as getting a lawyer (and I can certainly understand the financial concerns), your mom might want to call either your local women's shelter, or the [National Domestic Violence Hotline](http://www.thehotline.org/). Either of those will be able to point her to resources that are available in your area, and they usually have local lawyers who will do at least a free consultation.  Hopefully he will go to therapy and everything will work out, but your mom should also know what her options might be. And they can also give her some support- the two of you sound very close, but it wouldn't hurt her to talk to someone else about it as well. 

Good luck-  I hope that things work out.  Feel free to pm me if you want to talk- you're in a rough situation.

That said, you shouldn't have had your boyfriend over to stay during lockdown (I'm inferring you're in the UK or somewhere with similar guidance so apologies if I'm mistaken on that). By doing that you risked her health as well as hers. As best I can understand it, that's what you've done wrong. I think if you haven't acknowledged that in your communication with her so far you need to do that.

Again, I don't think she handled this well and she could have been kinder in asking how you were feeling, offering to help out, etc. And just storming out and not paying bills and then ghosting you is not a mature way to handle it. But I have sympathy with her feeling like she's been forced out of her flat because you went against public health advice (and possibly the law, depending where you are). She had a choice between not being able to live in her own home or isolating with you and facing a high probability of getting there virus herself.

It is easy to have it chronically, to don’t have to search for them between other things like on a laptop your phone gallery or in WhatsApp. As long as the account stayes private and she is careful about whom she is allowing to see the account i don’t see a Problem with this.

Why your wife didn’t tell you? Well it could be that she just thought you don’t use Instagram so why bother you with it. 
The worse reason would be that she knows about the tendencies you described yourself and was afraid or hesitant to tell you about it.

It is good that you are trying to better yourself. But I think If you want your wife to tell you such things in the future you should talk with her calmly about this. Don’t attack her and don’t throw accusations. That may just lead to her closing  up and just defend herself instead of taking your concerns seriously. Say something like I found this and that and because of this reason it makes me feel so and so. 
If you can’t do that yet in the heat of the situation maybe ask a friend or someone other you trust to be a medioator to help with staying focused on the topic and on the reasons and concerns you both have.

It might be that her parents had a horrible marriage and now she sees it as a way people get trapped and lower their expectations (aka, well, I got the ring now I can let myself go or lay around and let him / her do everything, woot!)  But I would ask about the financial and logical reasons behind marriage - when she's in the ER and you have to track down her mom or her sister to make medical decisions because you're not a relation... or her thoughts on creating wills to address property and financial assets so some family member doesn't swoop in and confiscate everything. These are the more concrete reasons for a ""paper contract"" that you need to discuss outside of the romantic nature of until death do we part. But you won't change how she values ""marriage"" and hopefully it is a personal value system and not that she's ""just not that into you"", which I believe is the more primal fear when marriage is discussed.

rel_373915,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,426,"When I was 14, one of my parents came within inches of being murdered by a deranged psychopath, who then proceeded to terrorize my family for three years because he was related to the local sheriff. My sister was nearly raped by that man. After my father's nervous breakdown, I took the reigns of the family business, and nearly paid with my life as well. I too went through my fair share of hard knocks when I was young, and I too felt that I was more than mature for my age. I also believed I had grown up fast, and I was far too full of myself to listen to people who were only trying to offer advice to me.

It's been a long time since then, and I recognize that I was a shithead. And I recognize a situation that exactly parallels what I went through with women when I was your age. And while you don't like my advice, it's true. You aren't mature enough to make the decision between the two women yourself, as you've already shown. There's no ""falling hard"" after falling in love. That's thinking with your penis and sex drive, not with your brain. In a successful long-term relationship, the brain does the thinking, and the penis gets told to shut up. A mature person either chooses to keep the long term relationship and shuns the other, or civilly breaks up with the long term relationship and chooses the new one. That's called being an adult, not a whiny teenager who thinks he's all grown up. And when you get married, you will face that on a monthly basis. _If you can't make this decision on your own now, you're too young for the kind of long-term marital relationship you want._

Let me put this in black and white for you. You are emotionally cheating on your long distance love, you're putting your long distance love (who abused you) on a pedestal she doesn't deserve, and you are expecting a teenage relationship to work out. Haven't you thought that these women might need to grow a bit themselves before they know what they want? You are also falsely leading on the local girl and cheating on her emotionally too. That's high-school drama shit, and if you read other posts here, that's the stuff that destroys adult lives.

I'm only trying to provide you with advice that you requested. I too have gone through almost the same situation you have described. It's up to you to put the pieces together."
rel_3445788,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,839,"This is good at least if you can identify the problem as needing friends. Try to not give your boyfriend too hard of a time when he tells you he's heading over to his cousin's house, just let him go, tell him to have fun and you look forward to seeing him in the morning or whatever (no pushiness or anything, just embrace the fact that he's going, since you know you can't do anything about it anyways). Honestly, I think once you're able to branch out and make some friends of your own, this ""issue"" will become a non-issue because either you'll be able to go out with your friends on the night he sleeps at his cousins and therefore be distracted/happy enough to not miss him too badly, *or* he'll decide to start bringing the sleepover to your house. 


I was thinking about it, too, and your best friend is only 45 minutes away from you. Why don't you two make a plan that she can come over to your place on the nights when your boyfriend will be at his cousin's? If you plan this in advance (since your boyfriend seems to do this around the same time each week, right? And even if you plan it and he says ""oh well I wasn't going to go that night"" or whatever, stick to the plan and don't flake on your best friend. If your boyfriend happens to still be around while *you're* having a sleepover, it could help for him to see you being happy and social, and it could also make him feel a bit bad that you don't get to be included in his plans), even if transportation seems like a problem, with enough notice you absolutely should be able to pull it off. I've dated more than one guy in the past who've lived a 45+ minute drive away (and I don't drive) and still managed to get out to see them often. Public transportation, though it may take longer overall, is a good option if you/your best friend don't drive. Having her come to sleep over will probably help you to feel a bit more comfortable in a new city also - you two can go wander around and explore, which will be fun and helpful to you as well. 

And my last point, is that I understand it's harder to find girl friends for sure. 

So, 6 or 7 years ago I moved across the country with my then-boyfriend. So I was uprooted and moved away from my family and all of my friends. For the first few months it absolutely was hard for me, and I'm a pretty socially outgoing person usually. I ended up making most of my friends out west through work, or through where I lived. In all fairness, we moved to a small town so the sense of community was pretty great, but it did take me a while to squeeze into ""fitting in"", but I mean ""where I lived"" as in the building we were living in for the first little while. It was a sleazy place to live 'cause we were broke, but I made some life-long friends there (who were in the same situation as me) just by being neighbours with them. And work too, yeah, in fact I even met my now partner through work. 

Anyways, so out there, making friends at work and through living arrangements are what worked for me. However, after living out west since I moved out there 6 or 7 years ago, my (not the partner I moved out there with) now partner and I have moved back east 'cause we have a baby together so we came back to my family. And it's silly, because when I moved away I had tons of friends here, but upon coming back, I have very few left. So I'm in the same boat again, left all my good out-west friends and I have to re-make friends in the east. 

Anyways, my best suggestion for that so far is to join a club or group of some kind of something that interests you. Starting today, for example, I'm joining a mom-and-baby play group so hopefully I'll meet some other mothers that will want to hang out with me. You mentioned you're interested in cars - is there some sort of car-workshop group, or like a drag-racing group, etc? 

Sorry to go off on such a tangent, but I hope I helped at least a little bit. My main point was that I know how you feel, being uprooted with only your boyfriend there, but you will get through it. Work on getting your best friend out for sleepovers (and try not to feel silly asking. It's really a pretty good idea). It might even be easier for you to make friends if you're with another person initially, so keep that in mind too. I know I'm a rambler, but let me know if I can help in any other way. "

1.) you do not feel that your voice or needs (physical and emotional) are being met by your partner. 

2.) your wife has taken to belittling you to others. This is a form of abuse. As you ignored the minor forms as just a joke, she is now graduating to more extreme forms.   I suspect that she is also verbally abusive to you in private even though you haven’t mentioned it. 

I have female sexual disfunction as well and I can tell you that even when I have a hard time performing I am always showing how much I love my husband. 

Your wife’s libido  and ability to sexually perform have nothing to do with affection or respect.  

You now have a decision to make, therapy to try and figure out what is going on with your wife (focus on the abusive stuff because it is easy for her to just say she will do better on the meeting your needs and then just flake off).  Or you need to start putting together an exit strategy. 

Document all of the times she belittles you, verbally abuses you, and withholds sex to manipulate you.  All of this will help in a divorce.  Even if you choose to go with therapy, keep a journal for the therapist. That way when she denies that she did something or says she doesn’t do it as often you have a record of what was said and how often.

rel_28321224,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,142,"From a woman's perspective, her behaviour is irrational, yes, but it can be made sense of.

My guess is that she agreed for the friend to join, because she didn't want to hurt her and the quickly understood that she overestimated 1. her friend's decency not to cuddle with the husband 2. her willingness to share her husband and their special movie night.
She then probably tensed up and kept watching the movie, thinking about how to tell her friend to get off, which then spiraled into: ""he's not saying anythin, seems like he likes it. Who wouldn't? She's so young and pretty...(and so on)"", so that it got more and more awkward to say anything and she felt more and more insecure with each passing second.

Anyway, just my educated guess from a couple of years of being tortured by oestrogen."
rel_34677587,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,203,"So feelings aren't wrong. Your feelings are your feelings. 

That said, there may be some sexism, insecurity, and entitlement informing both your internal reaction and your decision to direct your partner to change her behavior. 

I want to challenge your idea about protecting the relationship. I don't cheat on my husband. If someone flirts with me, it's not a threat. If I flirt back, it's still not a threat though I usually try not to. If someone touches me, it is not a threat. If they touch me in a way that is uncomfortable for me, I certainly put a stop to it but that is my decision. 

I'm not sure just what you're observing. There are types of touching that would clearly indicate that she is not acting like someone who is in a relationship. I get the feeling this doesn't rise to that level because you're asking her to put a stop to it rather than reacting to apparent infidelity. 

Anyway, this got long buy my point is that you protect your relationship by deciding to be loyal to each other. I suspect that  she was not giving you the full response you wanted because you are being possessive and overbearing."
rel_23169376,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,222,"Your bf sounds like one of the people that jokes when they’re nervous and finds comfort in laughter. It seems like it was a bit unfair/unreasonable of you to to have a meltdown when you also understand that his life isn’t even realistically at risk and there isn’t much to worry about. I think he was probably justified in feeling upset in the moment, needing to console you when, deep down, he’s probably more afraid than you are. 

It sounds like your relationship will continue and you’ll move past the whole thing, but I think it’s important for you to understand how you deal with stressful situations, and the type of support your bf needs in situations like this one. If it’s hard for you to stay level headed, that’s not necessarily a bad thing; but it might be good for you to realize when you need to give him some space and give others who are close to him the chance to give him the kind of support he needs. You don’t need to be the jack of all trades and give him 100% of what he needs, 100% of the time; sometimes you can rely on his family or friends as well. Over the course of a lifetime, much more stressful medical situations will come up. Whatever happens, good luck!"

And if your kid ends up doing something else, you’re okay with them feeling like a black sheep just like your sister? What the hell is wrong with you?  Grow a back bone.

It's not like someone trying to loose weight but you used whole milk in their coffee instead of fat free because you ran out and just didnt tell them. No matter what age I was I wouldnt have done something like this. Even what you did was pretty messed up you should have just asked. It wouldnt have been hard to just yell ""hey! We are out of veggie cubes do you care if I use a beef one?"" They could have just made a PBJ sandwich it wasnt nearly a dire enough situation where they absolutely needed to eat your food no matter what. You dont mess with someone's food.

rel_426584,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,151,"Dude, it's fine...It is scary. Marriage is a big commitment, and it isn't one to be taken lightly. The important thing is that, regardless of who you are looking at, you are remaining true to your girl. I questioned marriage numerous times during my engagement. I went through a million reasons not to get married. However, I knew in my heart that my girl was the only one for me. 

You have to make a decision...when you lay down at night, do you want to be alone, with someone else, or with your girl? This may seem pretty simple, but the answer is very telling of what you actually want. Whether the day has been good or bad...no matter how life is going..who do you want next to you (if anyone)?

Getting married was the best decision I ever made, and I have never been more in love with my wife. "

If one event breaks you down enough to want to die, the next one may take it to the next level. Do you really want to die? Or do you just want an end to the suffering you feel? It's possible, without taking your life. Think only about what you can do right now to make right now a little better. That will look way different depending on the now you're in.

There’s SO  many red flags but you want to see the green ones sooooo bad. What you just described is so utterly gross on his part. Absolutely disgusting, and based off your replies, it looks like you’re wanting someone to agree with this relationship and give you the green light… but anyone with an ounce of sense isn’t gonna do that.

rel_7102314,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,139,"OPs wife may be worried she’s just about to adopt an 18 year old step child. 

She might be worried about the blurred boundaries. 
Will this child expect birthday and Christmas presents?
Will op provide gifts? 
Will op contribute time and money and resource?
Will the offspring expect anything like this?

The offspring may well be looking to meet, clarify family history and health/heredity facts etc and that be it, but they may well wish to pursue a better relationship to which I think is what OPs wife fears. 

And I would too. 
I wouldn’t like a step child of any age.
Even if I were older and somebody said “they’ve flown the nest” It would still be a no go for me. 
Even if somebody was a weekend parent. I wouldn’t want anything to do with step children."
rel_25688508,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,272,"I'm going to be the counter idea here and say you're friend could be right. People do give off subtle cues (facial expressions, looking around, being stiffer than normal, laughing or smiling nervously, etc.) That you may be able to pick up on more when you know someone better/longer. And there are women who don't feel comfortable drawing boundaries or even admitting later that they were uncomfortable, especially if you're coming at them upset/angry/shameful. I would guess one or both may have been a bit uncomfortable but not enough to say something or stop it or want to address it since it could cause you hurt or them drama.

You should still ultimately listen to the women themselves over your friend, but I would take it as a sign to back off a bit more and check in consent in a way that provides options instead of a direct yes/no. Like ""do you wanna keep dancing on each other, or would you like some breathing room while I dance next to you?"" Or ""Is it okay I touch you, or would you prefer to just be close?"" Or ""do you like this or nah?"" gives more agency than ""is this ok?"" ""Are you ok?"" That often gets used and that guys can often get mopey (or even rude) about if you don't agree. 

While it's not your responsibility to read minds, and the women deserve to be trusted to make their own decisions and set and communicate boundaries, it doesn't hurt to be a lil extra careful of what nonverbal communication is at play or ask for more clear and positive consent."
rel_16229011,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,233,"TBH, I haven't read through all the comments, so this might be a repeat. 

BUT - having gone thru my marriage, in-laws, and a teenager who challenges everything, I've learned that relationships aren't about what you say/how you say it, but instead about how the other person perceives the message. 

You might be taking something away that he doesn't mean to communicate. And vice versa. It's incredibly difficult to acclimate to, but once you start communicating about How you hear things, it can help the other person understand. 

For example, my husband has a way of getting frustrated and talking down to me, slowly, like scolding a child. I tried being frustrated, telling him not to do it, etc. Finally, I said, when you talk to me like that, this is what I hear, this is how it makes me feel. Now, it's much less common, but if he (God forbid) slips up, I can say, ""I don't like that, you are talking to me [this way], and it needs to stop or the conversation is over."" 

That helped him get it way more than me just being upset, and he usually apologizes and explains, in a normal way, what he means. A huge part of our relationship is explaining what we are trying to say, and that has made things way smoother. 

People just communicate and interpret things differently. Bridge the gap."
rel_10796727,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,236,"You absolutely 100% completely DONT with 'tough love'

Let me repeat that; DONT.

You having this conversation with her will be devastating to her confidence. The first thing she is going to think is that even her best, most supportive male friend thinks she's too fat to ever be loved. She has already been addressing her weight herself; what do you imagine you are going to ""address"" with her that she doesn't already know?

Your assumption that she would be better able to find ""a"" guy if she were thinner is at best misguided, very prejudicial and at worst very dangerous for her.

Would she get more male interest if she were thinner? Possibly. But the same could be assumed for other body traits too.

But male interest does not necessarily equate to the 'right' man or a life partner. She is being used because she is meeting the wrong kind of men, not because she is fat. Think of it this way; it's not like the men who would sleep with her and then bail would be great boyfriends if she was thin and they chose to stick around for a bit would they?

Your help to her needs to be around how to meet men who are a) not dickheads, b) may well embrace or even love her body type (there are plenty of us out there) and c) are compatible with her personality."
rel_4517341,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,154,"My opinion is that I wouldn't involve myself with someone who openly admits they are not over their ex.

The way he phrases his reassurances would stick with me too much. He didn't say the relationship ended so he would never choose to go back, he said they stopped dating because she made the choice to cheat on him. He didn't say she is out of his life, he said she'll be out of his life for as long as you are around. 

I do not think he'd for sure cheat. I do not think he's completely still in love with her. I do not believe you have anything tangible to be afraid of here. 

I personally would not be comfortable being with someone as they work through their time with someone else having ended. Not scared, just uncomfortable. 

Him hiding it from you is no help to you in the trust department either. "

Your (soon to be Ex) wife is selfish and never actually have time to develop and improve herself to be a good person. If a person constantly complaint and blame other for everything, including his or her emotional state, then that person never do any self-reflect on his or herself.

rel_18046846,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,303,"Many reasons why you may feel like you do about physical affection.  For example, I felt similarly at your age and came to learn that it was a response to caregivers who only touched me to hit me or restrain me.  A hug felt dangerous to me in my teens.  Other possibilities include sensory sensitivities, personal preferences, etc.

Some options:
1. Talk with him.
a. Start with what the relationship means to you and your feelings for him..  Ask him to share too.
b.  How does affectionate touch feel to you?  How does physical touch feel to him?  What types of touch feel loving to him?  What needs does it meet? (e.g., connection, intimacy, safety, pleasure, comforr, etc.)
c.  What makes you feel loved?  What makes him feel loved?  You could use the five love languages as a resource.
2.  Start Individual therapy to explore the roots of your relationship to loving touch.  Knowing that will be helpful.  Take great care in researching therapists and their specialties to select one who is qualified and fits your needs.
3.  Small changes.  To your bf something like: ""Babe, thank you for telling specifically what types of touch feel loving to you.  I shared with you how important our relationship is to me and you are to me.  That's where I'm coming from.  Could we start with one of them? [Suggest a specific one from what he shared that would feel good to you, if there is one] would feel good to me too.  Possible to start with that one and see how it feels for me? At the same time, I am starting therapy to explore my experience with touch and I'll share with you what I'm doing &amp; learning in therapy.""

I hope these thoughts help.  I went through a similar journey..  Best wishes."
rel_17471166,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,367,"OP just replying this message hoping you'll see it. You say that you have no traumatic experiences but it is not abnormal for people to suppress negative memories for a long time, stories of people realizing later in life that something did happen to them are quite common.

If this is the case, it is quite possible that you do have trauma and it was triggered by something you would never even think of. Say you had a bad childhood experience where you felt overwhelmed and powerless because someone assaulted you, or really hurt you while you were unable to stop them. You suppress the memory and are not consciously aware, but your body knows and remembers on a different level. Then years later you walk down the street at night minding your own business and suddenly a drugged out man comes running toward you screaming and threatening, only to run past you. Consciously you might be scared, then rather quickly think wow, wtf, what a weirdo, and move on. But in that moment where you freeze and are sure that someone is coming for you, no stopping him, you can do nothing, your body remembers. Think of how you can smell a scent (lavender) and suddenly are transported to that one vacation (France with all the blooming lavender fields). It is like that. 

All this is not to say this is what happened, I am merely trying to show you that not being aware of past trauma does not mean it never happened, and that not realizing what set you off now does not mean there was actually no trigger. Also obviously the way you feel does not have to come from a mental place it's just that, again, it still can even when you are not aware of the root. Therapy is very important but not the only way to work on things, but if you want to try to improve you have to listen to your body and accept that it knows more than you (whether that's psychological or just physical). Best of luck OP and I am happy to hear you have a partner who respects you and gives you what you need."
rel_8185831,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,220,"I agree with you - laziness is not a defining characteristic of abusers.  My first comment didn’t communicate what I intended.  I wrote it specifically out of personal experience with people I knew in mind.  It wasn’t meant to be a universal representation but that’s my fault for not being more careful with my words.  

I do stand by my second comment, though.  Poor self-regulation skills and difficulty organizing oneself does lead to harmful behaviors that hurt others and it is a very common reason why people abuse.  And a reason why many people continue to abuse is that it is really difficult to learn those skills as an adult.  Maybe impossible for some people.   

A spreadsheet to plot times to start arguments for the specific reason of undermining the OPs confidence in herself wouldn’t be done by that type of person.  The person who has poor skills.  It would be done by a person who glories in manipulation for its own sake.  Those people surely exist but I think they are less common than damaged people doing damage.   The OP boyfriend could very well be that second type of person.  OPs feelings are probably the most telling.

rel_6595243,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,388,"OP, I think your husband needs to consult a child therapist &amp; get advice for how to break this to them. You should get advice on how to handle their upset &amp; possible outrage on your behalf. 

I understand &amp; respect that you’re thinking long term here. Your husband needs to realize that this is on him, &amp; the future of his relationships with his kids rely on how he handles it. IMO, if he wants the absolute worst reaction &amp; blowback later, he’ll stand there &amp; watch them find out all of this from their incredibly sick mother. That’s not fair to them. They’ll hate him for making you his shield, making them not be able to discuss it because you’re in the room, this way isn’t allowing them to even have their own reactions for fear of further hurting you.

I think the kids should be told separately, the 18 &amp; 16 year old, the 14 &amp; 13, then the 10 yr old.
These children have watched you get sicker &amp; sicker. They probably love you more than anyone in the world, &amp; will feel protective of you. They’re not wrong if they’re angry, they’re allowed to feel betrayed. Look at how they may view it...you’re still here, they know you won’t be for long, Dad’s already started a new family, what happens to us now, how could he do this to us &amp; mom?
Let them talk, let them yell &amp; cry. They’re already under pressure, now they can’t trust dad to act in the best interest of the family. And they may worry who will care for you if he leaves.

Depending on what you &amp; a therapist decide, you could consider sharing in an age appropriate way, that you &amp; their dad haven’t been a normal married couple for years because of your illness.  And while you two never really talked about it, you assumed he was seeing someone.

I’m really sorry, OP. I see what you’re trying to do, the strong relationships you want to be your legacy. You only have limited power here to affect how this turns out, unfortunately. Although this may lead into more open conversations about relationships with the kids, what you’ve learned, what you hope your kids will have with their partners. All the best to you."

I am married. By some miracle. By very loving husband. He has friends, he has close family and close extended family. I have once told him of me feeling alone but he does not quite understand it. it didnt bother me until I got over 30. His family would be welcoming but I have zero incommon with them.

Your bf is i therapy, good. You just need keep assuring that you love him for him and not based on amount of friends. That he is not holding you back, you are with him because you want to be. 

You have some good suggestions how to get some friends, even online ones are great, just someone to talk with. Is there chance of your friends become his friends too?

rel_28634649,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,263,"&gt;My mental health has always been an issue with us he never really understood it and kind of shuts down when I try to talk about it.

This is a pretty big deal. For most people mental health issues are a lifelong struggle, if he's unable to show you sympathy and give support at 1 year in then he's really going to hate it ten years from now when you have another depressive episode and he ""thought you were over that"" or something. 

&gt;He's threatening to talk to my parents even though I don't want them to know any of this.

What would you parents do? Would they be able to help you? If they can't provide real support then he's just doing it to be mean, if they can then maybe you *should* consider opening up to them. 

&gt;How do other people with mental health issues handle difficult partners?

I don't think this is a fair question, not everyone wants a partner who has mental health problems. Not everyone is equipped for it, not able to fully understand the depth of the struggle or provide true sympathetic support. Sometimes if you haven't 'been there done that' then you just don't get it.

To him *you're* the difficult partner, and that's valid. 

I have severe anxiety, depression, and cptsd. I've been with people who couldn't (or didn't want to) handle that and I'm not going to hold that against them, they don't *have* to like me. If you guys are a bad fit maybe it's just that \\('-')/ people are just incompatible sometimes."
rel_229576,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,295,"&gt;...women with children... after a divorce...

Let's start here. I'm assuming that this is meant to indicate that you automatically assume women get custody after divorce; judges doing this too is part of the problem.

Mothers get custody, fathers are shut out on the mother's whim. This alone is absolutely heartbreaking to divorced fathers.

&gt;Dividing up community property hurts both parties equally.

Only if the woman brought as many assets and as much wealth into the marriage as the man did and earned the same amount during the marriage--given that the majority of women marry up, this is hardly ever the case. 

Divorced women's financial status only suffers in comparison to the time when ALL of the man's income was entering the household; however, with custody comes child support and most likely the family home. Then perhaps alimony on top. Tax free.

Examples of women being given excessive awards in divorce--of assets, money, child support or alimony are legion. (The ones men experience first or second-hand having the most impact.)

&gt;The state isn't destroying marriages, it's the parties that are married that can't seem to stay that way.

Women initiate around 70% of divorces and most for reasons like ""we drifted apart"" not abuse or infidelity. How many of these women might make more of an effort to work things out if getting custody, the house and continuing financial support weren't a virtual certainty? 

&gt;And yes, it is up the OP to decide whether it's a deal breaker or not...

Yes, it is. I hope she (and other women who love their men and want to be fair-minded) can stop and sincerely consider why a man might be hesitant to ""sign a contract between the government, yourself, and him"" as another poster eloquently put it.

please don’t cross post this. This is a throw away account for obvious reasons.

So, my (25F) boyfriend (26M) of 6 years just told me the story of when he was raped. Normally I would go to my best friend for advice, but this story is way too personal. (Hence the throw away)

So last night we were having a very deep conversation about life in general. And one of the questions he asked me was “what’s something you wish you never went through?” I answered and then asked him the same question. Once I asked, he took a deep breath and became super duper serious. He then went on to tell me his story. Now, I know this is super fucked up, but I kinda thought guys can’t be raped the same way girls can. I knew guys could be raped too, but I just thought it wasn’t as bad as girls because girls are generally weaker. I know it’s sexist, and I DO NOT think this way anymore. I would definitely kick my past self’s ass if I could. 

Just to put into perspective, when he was 17, he had a girlfriend that was kinky. She was into rope bunny type shit. And one day, my bf agreed to be tied down… and once he’s was restrained is when his girlfriend pulled out a strap on from under her bed and proceeded too… you know. This is breaking my heart, and I cried. He cried telling me this story. I held him for like 2 hours and we bother cried heavily. And it didn’t help that he also told me that he bled for months and it hurt so bad. I don’t even know what to say or do, other than hold him. 

I’ve never experienced any type of sexual assault, and I can’t imagine what he’s going through. And to think he’s been keeping this a secret for so long… he must’ve been in so much emotional pain in the past 9 years… I need help comforting him.

rel_8892394,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,190,"The worst thing really is how worthless this makes you feel. You forge such an intimate relationship with someone but have to remind yourself constantly that you can't get the feelings you'll /inevitably/ develop, and it's so hard to understand how the other person doesn't feel that same way after everything. Remember more people are emotionally available (like you!) than unavailable, but FWB only works out in the end when you're both the latter, so someone often gets hurt. 

He's not just sleeping with you, he's being very romantic. And he gets all of this without having the pressure of commitment/labels which he shouldn't get if it hurts you this much. My best advice is confide in your friends about it. If you want to let this go or try at just being friends but feel like you're not strong enough, they'll help you and remind you that you deserve romantic fulfillment. It does suck though, I miss the bond I had with my FWB. But they get less attractive the more you realise what they did (being so romantic and not figuring you'd feel something) was careless at best..."
rel_22961426,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,109,"Yeah, this is definitely not how a relationship should be. 

Please don’t ever stay with someone just because you’re afraid of not having someone there for you. It sounds as if he is not even doing the bare minimum already. You deserve better.

I would start looking at options of where you could live (possibly on campus) or maybe transferring to a university in your home country. 

Have you spoken with a doctor about how you’re feeling? I can only imagine how alienating it must be to have moved over there for love, be treated the way you are (being ignored), and not having any family or friends there."
rel_10539923,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,267,"Thank you for reading my responses.  Yeah, it’s totally nuts.  I feel like I was naive to not know that there were people out there like this? But the upside is, I don’t think it’ll ever happen again, I can spot these people a mile away now.  I think it also wouldn’t have happened to me if, at the time I hadn’t been so in love with the idea of being in love.  He wouldn’t have chosen me if I wasn’t vulnerable in this way.  I was ripe for a tear-down.  He knew it, he always chooses the same woman, they’re easiest to manipulate.  

I’m glad I figured it out, but it took too long (2 years), and I was too scared of him to leave earlier.  So much weirdness... like, he was sleeping with so many prostitutes. He’d sometimes introduce me to them but tell me they were his friend from before we met.  And one time I came home from a work trip and there was blood all over the downstairs bathroom towels.  Where did the blood come from? I asked him and he said “it must’ve been from blah blah blah”.  It’s the “must’ve” that I’ve got a problem with.  Have you ever seen police interrogations of killers? They say “it must’ve” a lot.  Why did my favourite dress go missing? Who did he give it to? Well, it gets to a point where they stop hiding their actions so much and the gaslighting fails to work because of this.  Also, I thought I was going to die if I stayed.  

Thank you again!"
rel_3810083,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,329,"I’m a woman but I’ve had some extremely harsh experiences in my life with men. My ex fiancé lied about having an STI, gave me bed bugs, and after i helped him get on his feet he never thanked me. Had to threaten to take him to small claims court for him to pay me back for all I’ve done equaling over 2000 dollars. Then there was my ex who would make me have sex with him and shame me for not giving him my virginity. I finally left him when he threw me across a room. The last guy i dated lied to me about everything including his name, found out he wasn’t from this country. He was deport last month. Oh and there was the guy i dated in college who preyed on my feelings after i was sexually assaulted a few months before. He promise he would treat me badly. I had a miscarriage with his child and almost died. He convinced me to go home to get treatment and started ignore. A month later her told me he was with someone else. Years later he kept bothering me. And then began to spread rumor about me. Even to this day he is still spreading rumor we haven’t dated since 2013. 

Moral of the story stuff happens. I take blame because i have picked bad men, but i never fear loving. I know that all the pain and experience will make me a good wife, mother, and career woman. I’m strong and someone will wholeheartedly love me. If not i love myself. While i want a relationship i have been single for 3 years and I’m very happy with myself. Of course you will get lonely but learn to live with yourself. Don’t let past endeavors stop you from loving someone new. And learn to be happy alone.... I haven’t let this stop me and frankly speaking i have been through some bad s:&amp;@t. Good luck."
rel_29540315,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,281,"I'm confused about what else you expected. 

You're in your thirties having unprotected sex with a near-stranger, which makes both of you idiots who are likely too immature to be decent parents.

You unsurprisingly get pregnant and decide to have this baby from this near-stranger and then you're surprised when he decides he wants no part in that shitshow.

Him ghosting you forever is one of the best case scenarios for women in your situation. If he demands to be on the birth certificate, he can control your life for decades. He could be abusive. He could have vastly different views on parenting. He could have a fucked up family. He could get married and your kid could have a shitty stepmom. There's an infinite number of horrible possibilities. If you're going to be reckless enough to have a baby from some random dude (as opposed to using a sperm bank if you want to be a single mom), you should at least be grateful he appears to be gone. 

I would also caution you against going in with the idea that you have a great support system. You might have good friends and family but none of them signed up to raise a baby born in unnecessarily difficult conditions. They might not be as helpful and available as you think. Single motherhood is rough. 


The way you talk about this 4 month long-distance fling as if it's a serious long-term thing is also a giant red flag that says you might need some therapy and a healthier outlook on relationships.

I really hope it works out for you in the end, but odds are against you in so many ways."
rel_2667964,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,145,"That's definitely good way of thinking and definitely applicable in a toxic relationship but I wouldn't just do it with any relationship cos I have a strong beleif on working with things for a while before giving up.

Tbf I don't even know if I'm good emotionally or not..Honest lol like he makes me feel I'm abusive.

rel_17853544,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,364,"Look, I’m not trying to control him. I’m trying to explain why he may cater to me so much. This doesn’t mean I like it. I want him to enjoy his life, the breaking down is just hard for me to control. 

I have told him I want him to go if he wants to go, he doesn’t get to go often. Especially with school taking so much of his time. 

I know I won’t die without him, I’m perfectly capable of being without him. The anxiety is just not easy to control so I break down, and I try to do it away from him so he doesn’t get guilted but we were in a long car ride and I couldn’t hold it in. Do not tell me I need to be a big girl, you do not know me. 

And I know what it means to be engaged, I never said it was the ring. I can stand up for my partner just fine, but seeing him explain it puts a smile on his face because he loves to forge and I love to hear him talk about it and it seems to ease my family as well. I’m not freaking out about the ring, I’m extremely excited for him to make it because forging is one of his favorite hobbies and hearing him share it and talk about it with me is really fun for us both. The only reason I’m upset it isn’t being worked on yet is because he’s been so stressed to the bone about school that it’s the only thing I can think of to give him a break and enjoy a hobby he loves but feels he never has time enough for, and I can use the excuse it’s the ring for him to take his well deserved dip into fun. And I don’t mean ignore his studies, I mean stop spending so much time with me and enjoy his hobby and I’ll sit with him so he can talk about the process as he goes because he loves to do that. He even likes to get me to help with the easy and safer tasks."

I watch porn and have even suggested before that we should watch some together and do those things. The only thing i am not okay with is being degraded, everything else i am game. The things he is messaging people about are things we do together. But i agree with what you are saying. Maybe there is something further he wants that we haven't done yet and i need to keep an open mind.
 I take full responsibility for my actions, like i stated before they are not justified by any means. I invaded his privacy and broke his trust. That is something that is going to take a while to fix, but i am a trusting person so if he says he is going to stop i am going to believe him. 
I am willing, if i decide to continue the relationship, to put this behind us. Like you said, once its done its done. No throwing it in his face or holding a grudge. I understand that mistakes can be made and if i decide i want to work it out i would absolutely do what i can to fulfill what he wants in all aspects of our relationship.

rel_3446386,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,199,"I know it's not the popular opinion but I think it's fine for you to address this. As someone [18F] who's been in a very similar situation with drugs, alcohol and unfamiliar faces my boyfriend [18F] made it clear he was uncomfortable. Just like your girlfriend I never got upset, as long as you let her know it's from a place of love she will realize you're not being controlling, just protective. 

You don't have to inhibit her fun by any means, just make sure she knows what she's doing and doesn't go in blind, or go any further than weed. I don't think it's mothering her, I'm not sure how your girlfriend is but I was kinda flattered when my boyfriend expressed his rightful concern. Weed itself can't kill you purely off the dosage and I know that now, I think the concern should spawn from the fact that it IS so easy to take advantage of someone when they're stoned. 

Being in a compromising position while not being familiar with anyone around you definitely validates concern to me, and in relationship boundaries are crucial, and boundaries are certainly possible to be had without seeming like an asshole."
rel_9088477,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,226,"My husband does this to me but a bit differently- he likes to do this when he gets into bed.  He thinks this is the ideal time to talk and go over the events of the day. I think it is the ideal time for me to try to relax and go to sleep lol .  So now before I go to bed I come into the room where he is and ask is there anything you want to talk about because you know once I lay down how I am and I laugh .  We usually talk - sometimes not but now I get to go to sleep . 

I think maybe you need to just talk to him and say you know he is excited to share his day and you really do want to hear about it but sometimes you are honestly exhausted.  So how about he comes in and asks you are you up to hear about today’s antics honey ?  The way I ask my husband do you want to talk about anything before I go to bed

Truly, men aren't going to pull this shit on a wife they actually respect and don't see as just their household maid and cook.

Do a sit down and come to Jesus with him about all this. The fact he even thought it would be OK means you two do not have a loving and respectful relationship.

rel_13902145,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,230,"I agree completely. The day before I left for basic training for the army (january 6) is when I got into a relationship. Met her online a week prior and drove an hour and a half to see her. Never met in person before and never been to this city. I had a good feeling to get online a couple weeks prior to that day and found her. 

Fast forward 14 weeks and she drove to Oklahoma to see my graduation. The whole 14 week period was talking through letters. That was day 2 I saw her and left for the job training the next day down in Texas. 

Get to Texas and we talked on the phone when we could and what not and my parents finally met her when I was gone. My parents didn’t think we would last because I met her a week before I left. So they fall in love with her too and that was the first time they liked anyone I dated. September 17 is the day I proposed and that’s been 6 years later almost.

OP why don’t you take a step back. Imagine a guy (who isn’t you, just some guy) who is fucking other women because his wife has postpartum. He says “I have her permission though hehe”. What do we think of said guy? He’s an asshole. He’s more worried about getting some pussy than potentially compromising his relationship. He’s neglecting his wife and/or badgering her for not being up to sex. 

Every guy who is “that guy” thinks there are special factors in his case that make it different, but there aren’t. Work on the relationship you have and let the sex come later. It’s incredibly common for parents not to have sex *for the first year* after birth. You don’t have some magical situation that gives you a way to take advantage of your wife’s kindness and not be an asshole here. You’re not special, and in fact you may be a bit of a jerk judging by your priorities here. Your wife isn’t sexually satisfied either, so just suck it up like she is and power through.

rel_26299773,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,335,"Hi. Male here. 

Happy to provide some context. I don’t think you can fathom how incredibly tormenting it is for us to constantly have billions of sperm clamoring to get released. Everyday. It sucks. Porn has become less of an erotic thing but a quick release to imaginary scenarios in which we’re not in, but the imagery places our minds in those situations. Makes sense?

It’s like when you see a shirtless scene of your favorite male actor/singer whatever and your mind goes places. Sure, you’re not going to whip out porn with people who resemble him, but you’re probably going to be thinking of that or similar things if you’re the type to pleasure yourself as well. 

When in relationships, the girlfriend/wife isn’t always going to be in the mood. That’s what he meant by suppressing the urge to cheat. There’s a lot of temptations out there and they get worse when you’re in a relationship. People who wouldn’t bat an eye at you beforehand suddenly want to test the waters with you. A weird competition type thing in which some people want to see if they’re superior enough to lure someone away from their SO. It’s trashy all around. Porn will take care of those moments when the sperm is just howling to get released and you’re either not around or not on the mood. If that wasn’t an option, it makes thinking straight quite difficult. Stupid, stupid stupid mistakes can be made when you’re not relieved of that pressure. He’s in a relationship with you, not the porn. The porn is just a tool. You are a human being. 

Flip this around and imagine you had a special dildo you used when he wasn’t around or wasn’t in the mood. Your answers are the same. While he would also be in his rights to be upset as you are now, your points are also valid. You have needs that need met and are taking care of them yourself when your partner cannot."

rel_8307644,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,453,"I tried to reply to this earlier but got busy so here I am now. To echo earlier comments you two need to have a conversation about this, there are points on both sides that need to be addressed. 

In no particular order-your boyfriend needs to learn to be a little less rigid, a bit more flexible. I was like him, and still am a bit but I make an effort to go with the flow sometimes bc it’s what my partner needs. Plain and simple-you need a little more flexibility from him.

Next, he said that don’t initiate anymore or have become complacent. This has two parts-you may not initiate anymore because you always get turned down by his rigidity. I totally get that, you can’t keep initiating if it always gets turned down. HOWEVER, as much as it sucks, you should continue do SOMETHING. Maybe try to appeal to his interests when you suggest something. It is also important to never stop pursuing your partner. There’s tons of memes about this and while you say, I’m the same person as when we started, if he is saying this, there’s a good chance that there was something you used to contribute to the relationship that is now longer happening. I’ll call on my own relationship as an example-my gf will swear up and down that she’s the same person as we met two years ago. But the reality of it is that, while she may be the same person, she isn’t putting out the same effort. We used to cook dinner together or split it - I cook/you clean. Sometimes while I cooked or cleaned the dishes she would sneak up behind me and grab my butt, call me “her handsome man” etc. Now, I basically cook every single meal. I also have to clean all the dishes afterwards. She sits on the couch throughout. If I leave the dishes on the table, they will stay there till morning when I clean them. I still pursue her, and call her beautiful and try to get her to partake in whatever activity but she has just gotten lazy and complacent AND she doesn’t see the difference from them til now. 

Try to get him to be more flexible, and think back to when you first started dating and try to rebuild some of that fun-ness into your relationship. Also, a good tactic is to get him talking-ask him what he had in mind when he said you were complacent-that will give you the answers as to what you need to take action on. As a a trade off day you need him to be flexible and say yes to some of your suggestions."

However, I'm not quite like the typical male where I view sex in such a manner. To me, sex is still quite emotional, and I have only had sex with women I truly believe I love/extremely like... sheesh, it sounds like I am a wussy whore. Also, I am a jealous person. Even when people say things such as the purely physical urge, I think there is something more. My question would be ""why"" does she want this. Also, would this be a once and done thing, or would it be opening up a can of worms and have multiple threesomes. It sounds painful to me, to know that she wants to sleep with someone else (even her being honest), so even were I offered to have crazy awesome sex with the sexiest woman (at the moment, Adelle in my opinion), I wouldn't because I don't want to sleep with other people. I want to be in a relationship with one person and have sex with that one person, and eventually marry that one person. The reason why I'm in a relationship is in part, due  to that fact.

rel_38446571,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,252,"I just wanted say that as someone who once had a deadbedroom and has fixed it. Also hopefully as a good man who loves my partner this statement is so true. We don't want duty sex, that only makes it worse. You trying to bargain to get him to answer with nudes after making him feel so unwanted is downright manipulative. I get it that you panicked, but if you don't desire him then using sex as tool to get his attention can't be an answer. You don't owe him sex. You owe him open communication, some self reflection on why you feel how you do, and an honest attempt to get back to a healthy sex life. If that means counseling cool, if that means a medical check up and hormone levels checked also cool, and if it means life changes to help you feel less anxiety or stress that can also be done. 

However, leaving him with zero answers and no proof you are working towards a solution will only grow more resentment. Duty sex will also slowly build resentment. Ignoring this or saying I don't know forever will build resentment. He doesn't need more sex, he needs a wife who desires him enough to be bothered by her lack of desire and wants to work towards an answer and solution together. Now once you give him a path, you both must stick to it or whoever doesn't is now at fault. You need to provide that path first though."

I’ve lived with strangers or acquaintances and had it go MILES better than when I lived with my best friend for 2 years. You think you know each other so well and have the expectation that it’ll be like a long sleepover because you’re already best friends, and therefore don’t always have the necessary boundaries or standards you set up for strangers or people you know less well. I haven’t lived with my old best friend/roommate now for 3 years and we just finally started being close like we used to in the last year. It’s hard. My old roommate accused me of breaking her vacuum because I asked to use it once and emptied it and put it back in her room and everything, and after that I was like “I’m not using your shit anymore”. 

At the end of the day it’s her room and she can have a camera if she wants, if you don’t want a fight then I would leave the matter be, if she’s so forgetful that she can’t even remember what she’s doing in her own room and is blaming it on you then she can knock herself out, but maybe ask her to close her door when she leaves so you can pee with the door open, lol. No shame here, I do the same. Best of luck!"
rel_11199256,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,227,"Dude, this is probably the most constructive answer.

I agree I was partially projecting my judgement of myself onto her. She told me how crappy she felt about it, so I felt compelled to apologize, but then got upset that she didn't do the same in kind. I suppose you're right.

There is the if she did it to him, she could do it to me, but her bum boyfriend knew what she was doing. I don't know if he knew the full extent of it, but he knew what were planning on doing the day I saw him. That makes me feel if she feels the need to backslide into sex work, I would at least be told about it. She says she never wants to do that again, but suggested she wants to sell drugs instead of sex.

To address your 3 questions.

1) I want a long-term relationship.

2) What she tells me she wants is the same thing. She tells me she wants us to work together because she said she will be able to be more successful and hold the job down if I do. You can be the judge of the sincerity of that.

3) I think I will. I'm going to make the firm decision to either leave her, or stay and not bring our past up anymore.

Thank you!"
rel_861293,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,263,"I spent several years designing and auditing costume jewelry and accessories for a national women's clothing chain. You really do get what you pay for in this area. 

I would say that neither of these looks really great to me. You may be better off trying to find her an actual sapphire pendant in a heart shape, maybe with the diamonds around it, but on a good quality metal at a jeweler. Sure, it won't look like the one from the movie, but it will be obviously inspired by you listening when she said she wanted that, more personal because you picked it out yourself, and will last much longer. 

It will cost a bit more, but with stuff like jewelry you have to take into account durability too. If it costs $35 and breaks after 6 months, you have paid almost $6 a month for her to have this. If you spend $150 on a nice one and it lasts her 5 years, you've spent $2.50 per month. 

I'm also always a bit leery about buying jewelry of I can't see it and touch it. Some stuff looks great but feels cheap and garbage-y. Some stuff is depicted inaccurately in photos. Best to see/touch before handing over the cash. 

Edit: found this. While sold out and a fair bit higher than the price range on what you've shown, this is sort of what I was thinking. You could find a smaller version that she could wear every day without it looking over the top for a fair bit less, I'd say.

rel_2955333,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,347,"A am quite in similar but I'm the girl whose asking my SO to drop people.

-my reason : he told me not to worry about this girl friend whom he supposedly had a thing/crush/liked before we got together, And I was like okay. It fair enough, I guess friends r friends. But I hated it the most when he would tease me with having pics of her and mentioning her name, How he talked to her and flirted (which never happen he was joking). Even more of a reason for me to get pissed and more jealous? And he knows how much I hate the fact of him being all flirty with her.
But one day he sent a dick pick to her and flirted (but he said he including me in the picture like ""oh I wish I had a lot of money so I can fly ""me"" and you (the girl) down and can have a threesome""... but he never had proof of him saying that) didn't tell me about it for three months. And as much as o hate it, he tried to salvage that relationship as much as possible. Probably because he can't talk to me about real shit as he does with her... and it sucks cause I worked so hard to get my family to be on his side that he wouldn't cheat or lie etc and then he says ""it wasn't important enough to tell you about"". "" dick pick isn't even bad, like it's not the worse thing that I could've done"" ... so yeah we're still together and I'll always hate him for that. And the bitxh who didn't let me know about this when she said I see him as a brother. So you know how my face is like 🙄😤

But the thing is I understand friends are friends specially if you didn't have any attraction to them.

It sounds like this is going to be a war inside of him for the rest of his life. While understanding love and accepting is suppose to be empowering, he’s afraid of it. People deal with trauma differently. 

I think you’re doing everything right so far. You have faith in him as a man, but it’s up to him to recognize the importance of love. 

I would limit texts to like once a week, just to see how he’s doing. If he realizes he made a mistake he’ll be back within a couple of months. If not, after two months of trying, I would give it up. You sound like you’ve been fighting for him a lot already, sorry it’s painful."
rel_6627241,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,250,"You've got cause and effect backward. It's not that they're not attracted to you because you're a friend. It's you're a friend (and not more) because they aren't romantically attracted to you. 

The thing a lot of guys that don't understand the ""friendzone"" don't understand is that someone being a good/cool/great person does NOT mean you're compatible. There are tons of great people out there. We're not compatible with all of them. We're not attracted to all of them.

I like to use the example of a friend I had in college. She's super fantastic. She thinks I'm super fantastic. But we never dated, because we were fundamentally incompatible. She wanted one kind of life, I wanted a completely different one. We got along great when we were together, each think the other is awesome, but that doesn't mean we matched up.

And attraction has a lot of layers to it, they may not be able to explain which layer is missing, but still feel that it's missing. And then you end up in the ""friend zone"" because you're a good cool person to be around, but not who they want a relationship with. It's not that you're not good enough. You're just not matched.

When a square peg doesn't fit in a round hole, which is wrong? Neither, they just aren't a good fit together. A lot of 'friendzone' situations are one person realizing they don't fit with the other, and the other not realizing it or feeling differently."

Children should not be burdened with some messed up expectation to fix things for the parent. And this idea that he will ""coparent"" with some hypothetical person, but only have the kids with him like 1 day a week (that isn't coparenting) so it wouldn't be too much for HIM. What about the child - who deserves an emotionally healthy adult who isn't trying to correct their childhood trauma by ""copareting"" one time a week. Why should this other coparent and child be responsible for parenting not being ""too much"" for the father by agreeing to any of this nonsense.   
I am so horrified by the selfishness of this that I am besides myself. 

  
And what happens if the ""coparent"" who does 90% of the coparenting gets ill, dies, falls on hardship and that child needs their father to be an actual parent? Like, you know, 7 days a week. (I honestly don't think you would find ANYONE to agree to this ridiculous  arrangement he is imagining). 

  
Look, he has what sounds like treatment resistant depression and a really poor sense of who is responsible for emotional caretaking in a parent-child relationship. He should not have children. You don't want children. He has a wildly inaccurate fantasy about somehow having a child, with little to no care-taking responsibility, for that child to then ""fix"" him.

rel_19913089,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,354,"Well, hopefully it’s more about him not feeling comfortable to communicate what he wants.  He may be embarrassed to express what he wants for fear of judgment.  I give you major credit for trying so hard to meet his needs.  

Part of me is wondering if he hasn’t encountered someone else and is afraid to just come out and tell you. I’m hoping this isn’t the case and we’re at my original assumption.

Men and women are wired differently, but I’m sure you know this by now.  Unfortunately, for some men...they don’t get an emotional connection until they experience sex with a partner.  That’s not to say it’s “all men” or that it “can’t happen” but the intimacy level is different when things become sexual.  A lot of women can make an emotional connection through interaction and discussion.  For example, I once had a female friend tell me that there are things even more intimate than sex.  

I’d suggest (and echo) what a few others have said and try expressing to him your own interests and fantasies to help alleviate any reservations he may have for fear of judgment.  Assure him you’re not going to judge and that you want to be there for him, not only sexually, but as a confidant and friend.  Let him know it’s OK to build an emotional bond with you and that you’re a “safe place”.  He may not be used to expressing himself so you may have to be very patient and encouraging (not pushy).

Men go through stages and maybe he hasn’t realized he wants that true emotional bond because he’s seeking it through sex.  Help him express emotions...talk about biggest fears, first loves, biggest heart break.  The more he opens up in general, the more he’ll open up in the bedroom.  Women are typically more mature than men their own age when it comes to relationships until men hit about 30ish.  We aren’t accustomed to sharing and expressing S easily as the ladies.

Good luck...I hope you’re able to build a game plan from us “Reddit Therapists” and that it all works out for you."
rel_25862619,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,204,"Oh boy, this sounds like a tough one.  I can certainly understand your perspective.

Though the only thing else I think, is that divulging this, may be a pretty substantial blow to her, and greatly diminish any support you've expressed to her in pursuit of this end.  Saying you're very excited for her, then dropping what amounts to a bomb on her that you simultaneously have great unease... I'm not sure what you expect to achieve by telling her this?  

I would try and keep your conversation to very specific things: ""I am uncomfortable with meeting/reviewing donors"", for example, lest you cause what could amount to long term resentment and problems, even if they are the result of a very unfair premise to start with.  

Generally speaking though: if you're supporting her and setting the expectation that you're excited for her, do so; obviously an alternative is, ""I don't want to father what amounts to another man's baby"", and that is devastating - but from my perspective, trying to walk a line where you're introducing doubt and so forth about what in essence will be your son/daughter, is also a very risky move in itself.

Guy A and I have not discussed long-term commitment either (I'm not sure if it's something I should address) and there's a good chance that I may move for work within the next year, which means either relationship would most likely become long-distance. 

Guy B isn't necessarily opposed to being in a long-term relationship, he was just forthcoming about the fact that he's not sure he can give me the sort of ""relationship"" that he thinks I want right now. Basically romance isn't his top priority right now, and there may be times when we don't talk or see one another very often. However, he has spoken about the future as if I will be in it even if we aren't a ""couple"" or if I am romantically involved with someone else. We even discussed living together at one point. Basically he feels as if we will be a part of one another's lives in some way. He has not made any attempts to date other women since beginning our FWB relationship. As a friend phrased it...his mouth says he doesn't want a relationship but his actions tend to say otherwise. 

As far a Guy A's level of commitment, we've yet to have an official discussion other than establishing the fact he is not interesting in seeing other people at the moment. However, his friends have made it somewhat known that he talks about me a lot and that he seems serious. He's a shy guy and not the type to date around...generally if he starts a relationship with someone he intends to stick with it.

She felt totally comfortable sharing how she was hurt from this loss of an emotional affair, but seemingly doesn’t expect you to have any of your own feelings about it. If you do want to work this out (up to you), you’re going to have to have her really see you, she needs to try and see things from your perspective. Right now, she seems completely oblivious to you and if that doesn’t change then you are going to have major resentment (rightfully so) and your relationship will be doomed. Resentment can destroy any relationship and will be inevitable if she doesn’t learn how to see you as a complete person with your own needs and hurts and feelings. 

That being said, it can be done. You both just entered your 30s and things really do change again at that age for many of us. Leaving our 20’s behind means leaving old friends, bad habits, your laisez faire lifestyle, and start looking towards the long term. But this is the time to figure it out as you don’t want to delay the inevitable another 10 or 20 years it it is to come. 

If you have another counseling session, ask the counselor for you both to process your feelings hearing her say that, express all those feelings that gave you, and how it makes you feel about her and the both of you. 

Good luck!"

I exercise daily, I eat moderately healthy (I’m trying to lose weight so I kinda naturally eat less sugar and carbs), we eat out maybe once a week and I usually get the healthiest thing on the menu. Because of health issues (GERD and hypertension), I can’t drink caffeine, I can’t eat red meat, I hardly eat any carbs. I eat A LOT of vegetables, especially corn and carrots. I do indulge my sweet tooth every once in a while with a popsicle or chocolate chips. But only like half a handful. 

I sleep 8-10 hours a night. Sometimes more lol I love sleeping. 

I’ve been taking celexa for 10 years and just recently combined it with Wellbutrin at the advice of my doctor. I’ve actually felt a lot better with this combination I think. Like I said, at least I’m not in the blackest of holes anymore. 

As far as social life, I have a fiancé who i love and honestly probably would be much more miserable without him. I see friends maybe like twice a week but that is more than enough for me. 

most days, I still feel unmotivated, apathetic. Nothing really gives me joy. Everything just feels like a chore. Even things that are supposed to be fun. I think that is why I like sleeping. It passes the time and I don’t have to think about anything for a little while."

When I would tell her the advice I’ve heard from others she would flip and some how have a response for everything I said. She was good with  words. Was. 

Main thing she’d say is that I didn’t need to be entertaining other girls. Not talking to them.  Looking at them. I was with her and I am her family. I have 0 need for any other female interaction 

That Bullshit when she would ask “how was work?” Was bullshit only trying to find out if I had any female interaction. Asked that question like clock work. 

She would ask about my job and want to know every little detail to find out. When or what times I would have a chance to interact with a female.

rel_38735335,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,256,"The art studio reference - astounding how it took hold so quickly.  Amazing.

I don't know that this would be a poly situation (am not poly myself and only know from my dry research, so I could be way off base with this opinion).  This seems like him wanting to explore relationships with other people who happen to be specifically men, as that is what he is interested in exploring.

Sexuality aside, OP and her husband are in what has been until this point a monogamous relationship.  Her husband has now built a seemingly strong relationship with Jim.  This has all been done under the auspices of exploring his bisexuality.

But what OP's husband has conveniently forgotten, and she has let slide despite her hurt and concerns, is that he is currently in a monogamous relationship with her.  Her feelings and comfort are every bit as important as his needs.

I think OP needs to have a very serious, honest (perhaps with a therapist) conversation with her husband about a path forward for them - either separately or as a couple.  Watching porn, as another commenter mentioned, is one thing.  He is pursuing a relationship with someone else.  The sex or sexuality of the other person does not matter.  That he has roped her into their relationship is just, in my opinion, not okay.  ""But he's such as sweet guy!""  That doesn't matter.  OP needs to figure her marriage out...and she doesn't need to make room for other people in it if she doesn't want to."
rel_9876422,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,247,"Simply put, his porn consumption is 100% his business and 0% your business. 

With that being said, if porn is actually impacting our relationship we then have some stance to bring up the possibility. We are talking about, if your partner is masturbating and can’t have sex with you or he’s no longer sexually attracted to you then you two should discuss that. 

Whatever “doesn’t look like you” stuff he is looking at has nothing to do with you. Also porn is just fantasy. If you would like to help him realize some of those fantasies then you can approach him that way. 

All this being said, I also understand that this is super hard for you. I had an ex that was devastated when she found my porn. She felt it was about something she wasn’t doing in some way. It wasn’t. So often women will think their partners porn habits in some way reflect what they lack or want or even need. In some ways maybe, but it is not a place to shame someone else. Also, your partner isn’t blind. He will see lots of people and probably even be attracted to another person than just you and that can all safely exist in the fantasy unless you two want to make it a reality. 

If you are truly uncomfortable with his porn consumption, you have every right to leave the relationship. That is always your right, to leave for any reason you want."

rel_30921932,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,887,"Thanks for clarifying, OP.

The fact that your mother is doing this is not surprising. I have some experiences with toxic family members myself and I personally know people who have had similar experiences getting involved with abusive older men in their teenage years, and it's in no small part due to the trauma and abuse suffered from their parents and their attempt to find an escape from that toxic home situation with an older partner. It's an ""out of the frying pan, into the fire"" sort of thing.

You mentioned your father. Is he in the picture at all? Still married to your mother? Do you have a good relationship with him?

I would recommend visiting r/raisedbynarcissists. It may provide you with some emotional support on your problems with your mother and how those problems have affected you and choices as an adult.

OP, I'm afraid that I already had caught the part you wrote in this reply, but then deleted, about you wanting to leave your husband and knowing the relationship isn't good, but not having the means to leave.

Yes, I'm not going to lie to you. It's going to take time, energy, and cunning to work on creating an exit plan with three children, one who is still a baby. That was likely somewhat intentional on your husband's part because older, controlling men like to make it as difficult as possible for their victims to leave them.

If you want to start working on having the means to leave your husband, then I would recommend starting on the following steps. 

I'm not saying that you necessarily have to decide to leave your husband now, or even later. Hey, maybe you believe your relationship with your husband will improve, and who's to say it won't?

But you should start to put these things in place anyway because 1) it's always good to always have options, and if you never use these resources to leave, they can be useful for other emergencies; 2) if you don't and your situation worsens, you'll regret not having made these plans; and 3) everyone, male or female, should always have resources that are their own even if they're married. I myself am married and though my husband and I have several joint assets, I have my own personal account and savings that he will never touch.

1. Open a bank account that your husband does not have access to and does not know about. This account should be at a different bank than where you and husband's joint account is, and you should have them flag the account to completely restrict your husband any access to the account and notify you if he finds out and tries to access it. I'm assuming that either you don't work, given that you're a mother of three young children, or if you do it is a low-paying job. To start putting money away in this secret account, start getting small amounts of cash back at the register when purchasing groceries--say, $10 or $20, or however much you know you can get away with--that you turn around and deposit in your account.

2. Make sure you have all of your important documents--birth certificate, driver's license, social security card--in a safe place you can quickly find that your husband doesn't know about.

3. Work on getting your own car and putting it in your name only. Of course, when you're married, assets acquired during the marriage are arguably joint property, but it will make things easier for you to keep items that are in your own name.

4. Have a free consultation with a lawyer to get an idea of what steps you'll need to take if you decide to leave your husband and keep yourself and your children safe. Given your age, your number of young children, and your husband being the breadwinner, you'll be eligible for emergency child support and alimony during the divorce process, but, to protect your children, you have to have a plan of attack that goes in place immediately when you serve those papers.

5. Start strengthening your support system. Reestablish contact with extended family and good friends, and reach out to churches and community programs for women in your position (many church and women's nonprofit organizations offer daycare services for single working women, and will pay some of your bills if you are struggling after leaving a bad relationship).

6. If you don't have a college degree or much skilled job experience, look into low cost options for online classes or job training. Community colleges and job training in my area were free this semester due to worker shortages associated with the pandemic. Although the registration period for spring has passed, they might be offering free or low-cost classes in summer or fall.

(EDIT) 7. Get on birth control that your husband cannot tamper with. An implant, copper IUD, or (if you're done having children for the forseeable future) having your tubes tied are the best options.

OP, you may feel trapped, inadequate, and scared of the idea of being independent, but there are plenty of single mothers who leave bad relationships and end up making good lives for themselves and find good partners. The option is there if you choose to plan for and take it."

rel_19206164,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,239,"Haven’t had much success with FWB. As I get older I’ve become more emotional detached thus weirdly attracting all the women I don’t want. 
But in my hayday I had this flirty outgoing attitude which totally attracted the type of ladies that were looking for consistent fun. 
Buuuuuut it never would work out. In retrospect this is why;
I always approached things like a courtship.
Daily texting, getting to know them personally, emotionally getting involved if things were good (which ruins the dynamics), gifts here, outings there. Basically boyfriend tendencies and when the level of commitment wasn’t returned to my standards (which would have all but changed for something geared towards a more serious thing) it was self destruction time. 

My advice is that be aware that with any FWB connection that there is a potential moment where one person will catch feelings at some point. Maybe with you, maybe with someone else. It’s usually who ever wears their heart on their sleeves that gets the short end of the stick. 
Enjoy it and take it all in. It’s a good experience to have me thinks and you’ll grow with knowledge in terms of who you want and what you want for them.

If at any point the lines begin to blur with your expectations and wants in your current FWB, reflect and adjust accordingly. Sometimes leaving is better than holding around hoping for someone who won’t come around."
rel_31946551,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,144,"So let’s just be clear, this is classic wage gap bs. You expect her to either be apart from you 50% of the time or more, OR basically quit her job and travel with you, and work very very sparingly. You’re expecting that YOUR job come first, ahead of her career and your marriage. A traveling nurse job is no joke they can earn BANK. Hundreds of thousands per year. I bet she outearns you when she’s FT working. 

Regardless your expectation that your job come first is pure sexist bullshit. You make her job seem insignificant and downplay it’s importance in financial income and it’s importance to her life. It’s ridiculous that you think she’s going to make you her entire life and give up her job to travel with you and do what exactly while you work, go shopping? Cook you dinner?"
rel_37138564,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,366,"First of all never EVER let him make you cancel a therapy appointment. Clingy or not, you're in those appointments for a reason and your mental health will always come first. In my opinion? He's afraid to give you space so you can think about how fucked up what he did really was.

Now, lets lay this all out like it is:

You went through his phone and found texts he sent at 2:30AM asking a girl he knows to come over to his place because he's ""bored"" and said she could ""sleep over if she wants"".

He tells you he did this because his friend is ""sad"" over her and your boyfriend wanted her to come over to his place for some reason to ""talk to her"".

Lets be honest. If he was concerned about his friend and their relationship, there's no need for him to send her messages at 2:30 in the fucking morning asking her to come and sleep over.

If it were innocent, he could have handled it in a text message, or a phone call. He could have said ""Hey, I know x is upset, is everything okay with you guys?"" in text message. He could have asked his friend what's going on, if she and him are just ""face level"" friends. And none of that needed to happen at 2:30 AM. If it was out of true concern, it could've been done at any time of normal waking hours. Asking someone that's a ""face level"" friend to come sleep over at 2:30 AM just wouldn't happen. That, to me, says ""hey come hook up"". 

When you confronted him, he immediately got clingy and love-bombed you with kisses and words of affirmation. Telling you all those sweet words to try to get you to stay with him all day, showering you with affection to make you forget, telling you to cancel your therapy so you're not away from him for a second so he can continue to overwhelm you with affection and hope you forget what you saw.

You know what that text really was. He knows what that text really was.

Don't let him flip the script. Trust your gut."
rel_38060257,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,325,"Stay strong, OP. You have all of my respect for staying in touch with your emotions and addressing them accordingly when many just try their best to bury them. You're doing everything in your power to heal, both for yourself, your wife's memory, and the people around you. There's no universal timeline for grieving and Jane, having only known you for 6 months, has absolutely **no right** to dictate your progress. Jane sounds like she has insecurities to work through and unfortunately seems to be letting them affect her so much that she feels threatened by your grieving process. 

It's not easy growing close to someone after they've had experiences like yours, so I feel for Jane in that regard. It can't be easy for her figuring out how to love someone while trying not to appear as though she's trying to replace your past love. She may feel like she'll never live up to your wife's memory. She may not understand that while you can't just forget someone so important to you, you were still ready to open your heart to someone new. That being said, your transparency with her from the beginning gave her the opportunity to assess her own emotional capabilities and **whether she was willing to continue the relationship given your warnings**.

The difference between the two of you is that you're taking accountability and working through your emotions in a healthy way, while she looks outside of herself and blames the things that trigger her emotions rather than recognizing her own inner turmoil. Obviously I can't make this decision for you, but it sounds like Jane isn't as prepared as she thought she was. Maybe she misunderstood what allowances she would have to make in the relationship, maybe she's just tired of making them. At the end of the day, if she's no longer willing to respect your process, it's healthiest for both of you to go your seperate ways."
rel_19961184,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,153,"So there are a few things happening here: 

1) you are financially dependent on your mother 
2) she does not like tattoos 
3) she’s doing the typical narcissist thing where she projects, that you are an extension of herself , and therefore your body/choices are a direct affront to her entire being. 

Advice: my mom, is your mom. My sister has ALOT of tattoos (full sleeve, back &amp; ribs). My mom looks at my sisters tattoos, as if someone had forcibly put them on her own body. 

Don’t get the tattoo unless you are ready to set real boundaries, and provide for yourself financially. 

It took me, I’d say a good 5-years, to convince my mom (and dad) to leave my sister alone about the tattoos. 

I know it’s your body, your choice, your life, ect. But unless you’re ready (and able) to deal with the nuclear fallout from this action, I’d wait."
rel_36170153,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,216,"You feel like it is something that can be fixed. But does he feel the same too? Does he want to fix it?

The perfection otherwise is probably not worth the pain or discomfort that he knows about, has said will change and completely disregards not only that you are in turmoil mentally and physically, but that more or less he has given his word.

This is merely a guess, but he does not see a problem and he doesn't see it as a potential deal breaker. So as others said don't waste more time thinking he will change, he will try, he will have your pleasure in mind. You are only keeping yourself warm for now with the thought that everything else is perfect but at one point that won't be enough.

I am not going to say straight up break up, but if you have talked about it, tried to solve the issue, tried to change something and he refuses to acknowledge it or communicate openly about it - there is no point. At the end and I am saying it as I have been there you will only wonder why you let it go for so long and treated yourself as a second priority when your partner isn't treating you as his first."

Believe me when I say this. When the time is right to tell her you love her, you will know it. If you have doubts about when to say it or not, then it is not the right time.

I would also say that it is probably better to assess the relationship at first and try and predict how she might react to your declaration. If there is a chance that she might freak out and say she thinks differently about you, or she's not ready, or she might never feel the same, don't say it!

The test has modified English, modified Arabic, and a made up gibberish language. They test you on syllable stress identification and grammar. The test introduces several grammar rules individually with basic sentences, and then combines them in addition to harder and more complex statements. There are more questions with less time to answer them, and the answer choices are read to you once. You don't get to read them or hear them again, or write things down. You either are getting it, or you aren't. If you're picking it up from the start or understand the rules/patterns right away, you got it. If you aren't, didn't, or think you did but are actually wrong, you're essentially doomed out of the gate

Anyway, the rest is straightforward. The test requirement was met, and I was slotted to the position and the rest of the process rolled on. She can always take the test again in six months, try to get into the unit anyway with her score, or just try to go to another unit. That test score doesn't mean you *can't* do it, it just serves as an indicator of how well or how poorly you'll do at the schoolhouse and their structure. It's up to the unit to decide if that score is worth the gamble


Edit: Linguists in the NG are pretty unhappy people, regular army too. You're not really going to ever use what you learned, but will need to maintain that language proficiency and take time out of your normal career to do it. The training is like two years' time out of the gate. Promotion opportunities are extremely limited as well, and it's really not linguistics and history the way she thinks it'd be. You're translating signals intelligence that's taken from like radio, phone, video, etc. ***if*** and when you ever ever ever get to do it outside of school


Edit 2: you can test out of the DLAB, but from what you wrote, I'm not sure she'll be successful with just ""speaking a little"""
rel_14193047,relationship_advice,reddit_comment,246,"You may feel like your petty revenge is justified because of two years of ""all the porn I had to watch while I was forced to jerk off in the bathroom"" but it isn't. You handled your problem poorly and chose to continue an unhealthy situation for two years. Yes, your ex is extremely selfish and immature but you shouldn't stoop to their level. If anything you should realize your ""petty revenge"" borders on sexual harassment and will help your ex justify their nasty behavior towards you.

The exact scenario happened to two of my friends. Bob and Barb dated for two years and ended up engaged. Barb had no sexual appetite so they had a dead bedroom scenario for the last nine months. When they broke up Bob was a complete dick and trash talked his ex to everyone in ear shot whether or not they even wanted to hear all of their dirty laundry. Most people were prepared to prevent drama by simply cutting out Bob to stay friends with Barb. That was until Barb literally did exactly what you're doing and started blasting porn and hooking up with randoms right next to the wall dividing their living space. It may have been ""petty revenge"" to Barb but suddenly no one was on her side and everyone only had sympathy for Bob. Guess who was the one ostracized? Don't be like Barb and try to figure out your stress without lashing out onto others."

I'm not anti weed at all. he tries to turn it around on me like I am. but I've told him if he could be responsible with it I'd have 0 issues. I grew up with pothead and all my friends were. I don't like it because it gives me anxiety attacks but he claims I only want to control him when that's not the case. he gets so stoned that he literally left our 14 month old in a full diaper for who knows how long, unfed. the day after I had a surgery, I was out mowing the yard after he said he would. I think he tries to use it as an escape from what goes on inside his head. I genuinely don't know. I can make assessments but could be way off base. he's said he uses it because it puts him ""in a better mood and helps his back pain"""
