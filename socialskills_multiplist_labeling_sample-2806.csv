Ok but you predicting how you think people will act, is an anxiety thing in and of itself. You could be right but you probably aren’t in this situation. And therapy is the only way I’ve gotten better. Don’t get in your own way of self improvement. Find a good therapist because it’s worth it. I’ve gotten drastically better so let that be your glimmer of hope. Anyone can get better but it’s 100% up to you and what **you** are willing to do for yourself."

It depends on how you're open to people and whom you're taking to. Especially in Covid time it's crucial to communicate with friends, family and familiar persons. First connect with your family, cousins. Don't try to push it very hard but chatt naturally. I know that it's not possible to always have a natural good flow of the conversation but don't try it too hard. Of course you have to put in some effort to it. Say hello to them, express your interest and concern in them, talk about life, challenges, hobbies, activities, plans and there's a lot of topics to talk about if you do it naturally. Remember one good old friend and text him. Maybe think of one your course mate whom you're most confident with. Get to know new people. Get in projects with people. Make some collaborations. Be not afraid of being ignored. I think this is very important step. Don't feel bad if someone ignores you or isn't putting much effort in relationship. This is totally normal. With time you will filtrate people whom you want to have a relationship or not. I would also mention to look at your self and make sure that you're positive. No one likes to talk with someone who is always sad and all he does is complains about life. Be the first one to text. Hope it helps mate and wish you best luck!"
soc_1318831,socialskills,reddit_comment,189,"Of course it’s possible, but if you’re in a relationship it might make things difficult if you’re hanging out one-on-one with someone of the opposite gender. (Or same gender if that’s your persuasion)

There’s nothing wrong with having friends, people are people. You just have to make sure you aren’t making someone uncomfortable with *the way* you hang with them, and it can be pretty daunting if you’re dating around and they find you have an attractive best friend that you hang with often. It depends on your personality, your partner’s, and your friend’s personality.

Some people view the opposite gender as a completely different creature, that they can’t understand or see in an equal way. Especially in this day and age, possessiveness and desperation can be quite prominent in a person. So it all depends on the people involved. I don’t think it’s necessarily wise to pursue friendships like this if you’re in a relationship, but on the other hand no one should be able to make you feel bad for having friends. It just requires some nuance and awareness so you don’t end up making someone uncomfortable."

Usually I like to approach people with the same fashion sense because I really stick out in a crowd that’s dressed in all black.  I also like to have a drink in my hand because it gives my hands a place to rest, but that’s my own personal preference.  I suggest getting to the concert early so you can actually have a conversation without competing with the music.  If you find a person or group that seems pretty chill, but they’re in a conversation, I would stay close and wait for them to stop talking, and then enter the conversation.  I usually just ask them for their name unless there is something about them that I can comment on, and I quickly follow up with a basic question like “where are you/you all from?” or “how did you get into (artist or band)?”  After that, the rest of the conversation is just up to you.

&gt; The work doesn't stop just because a person attended x amount of psychology sessions. There is always room for self-improvement. There is always opportunity for growth and learning. But you have to want it. 

My entire life has been one long session of self-improvement - because if I ever slip up, it might be the opportunity one of you needs to kill me. I *have* to improve - because the threat of death is always pointed at the back of my head.

&gt; Please, re-read what I wrote. I never said you deserved to be mistreated.

Yes you did, and you do now. You don't say it outright, but I know that the *real* communication is *between* the lines, not on them. This entire screed is just victim-blaming, insisting that everything is *my fault* and no one has the free will to choose *not* to react abusively to me.

&gt; I can empathise with you while disagreeing with you.

No you can't. In order to disagree with me, you have to reject *reality*; you have to reject *facts*. You have to be malicious in order to do that.

&gt; Can you see how, even though a violent response was completely justified when you were getting beat up on, the reputation for violence could have followed you and caused people to be wary of you? Actions beget reactions.

No one is obliged to believe rumors - in fact, they're obliged to *ignore them* and seek the truth for themselves. The fact that no one ever questions what they're told puts *them* at fault, and leaves *me* with no recourse as they will ignore everything I say and do form that point on, as the first point of all those rumors was to discredit me.

I did *everything* to please those assholes, and nothing worked. They *obeyed* the rumors and ignored my attempts t change their minds. *Nothing* I could have done would have stopped them from hating me.

&gt; Was your reputation a factor that impacted your ability to make friends only in your childhood? Or do you believe this reputation still hangs around you in your adult life, and that it contributes to your current isolation?

Nothing has changed from childhood; everyone is exactly as childish now as they were in school. No one ever grew up; they just got larger and more sophisticated in their methods of bigotry and cruelty.

I was hoping at least people would give up their bullshit as they got older, but instead they *doubled down*; they put their shoulders in to it and re-doubled their efforts to deprive me of anything I could work for, forming a *phalanx* of people whose social shields I cannot penetrate.

&gt; This is untrue. It is a lot more difficult to crack a pre-existing social circle, definitely. It's not impossible though. It's about confidence and risk-taking. When you're the outsider, you have to make the effort. People are, for the most part, happy in their little bubbles, so it's up to you to break through.

And, from *their* point of view, it's their responsibility to protect their social circles from me at any cost! It is their *duty* as members of their social circle to make sure I cannot break through their defenses. It is their mission to make sure I can *never* breach their defenses, to fight me back, and if necessary, to *kill* me to defend their tribe.

People are so knee-jerk *afraid* that I will infiltrate their social circle that they will phalanx-up *as soon as they know I exist*. They will not let me join them under *any* circumstances because they see me as an *existential threat*."

I believed her and felt sorry for her because by this stage she really didn’t have any friends left. Six months go by and she does something so horrible that I will never be friends with her or even say hello to her if I ever bump into her again. It was something that could have ruined my life forever. It was 3 months of waiting to see how it was going to turn out (what she’d done).

I think it depends on the person, how long you’ve known them, their maturity level, their age when they first started treating you badly and their age now (like, has their been ample time for them to grow he fuck up). Do you even need or want them in your life? What could they bring to the table? Were they funny, were the kind at all etc? What would happen if something went wrong.

I was able to focus on my hobbies and skills, stay out of trouble, did not have to worry about peer pressure with sex, drugs, or alcohol, and I saved up quite a bit of money from my part time job and traveled on my own. The only minor thing was that I ended up moving back after college and didnt really know anybody but I wouldn't consider that to be an issue for me though. It was more like moving to a new town, in a social sense. IMO, if you meet someone that you click with you, should see where that friendship/relationship goes.

I'll tell you a story. 

A boy gross up being bullied because he's so nice all the time. People tell him he's doing the right thing by taking the high road. He goes to college, makes a shit load of friends because he's the nice guy. Lands a dream job in his chosen field after years of hard work and everyone cheering him on. The job turns out to be incredibly hard and his social life suffers. People wonder why he's choosing his career over them although in his mind he's still being the nice guy. He decides to take on too much and hang out with his friends who complain they don't see him in spite of being tired as shit from his job. All of a sudden his work suffers. Now his employers wonder if they hired the right guy. His co-workers turn on him. He becomes a bitter loner at work. His friends say he should be lucky and happy. When he tries to explain that is not all roses , friends call him bitter and entitled. Friends start calling him less to hang. Guy finds out he's better off with only one or two friends and fuck everyone else for not listening. Guy gets labeled as a sociopath and to some degree he is because he now knows who has his back and who was just along for the ride and can now tell the difference from a mile away. "
soc_459229,socialskills,reddit_comment,181,"I have that problem a lot, too.  I think in general, a lot of men conflate female interaction with flirtation automatically. There are a few studies that show the more attracted a man is to a woman, the more attractive they PERCIEVE the woman to be to them.

I find that people also tend to make comments and""couple"" women and men together when hanging out as friends, so that can be your opportunity to say something. 
I have a lot of guy friends and none of them have any sexual/romantic interest in me, so it's up to you to feel out how this guy is acting and see if it's even an issue that needs to be addressed. If you think he's misinterpreted, you can comment as appropriate.

No need to ask permission from your boyfriend (LOL what a suggestion!), but it's polite to let him know upfront as a clear indication of transparency so he doesn't feel weird hearing about it later"
soc_1423272,socialskills,reddit_comment,135,"Hello


My 2 cents here

Get over it . What happened  cannot be change .  What other people feel for you is not your problem. How you feel about what you did however is your problem.  You need to understand  you did what you did because at the time you thought it  was right for you. So you need to decide  if you feel bad because  that WASN'T  the person you wanted to be or that the you feeling this way because you fear what other will think of YOU.

Now thats said....I have 2 options that I'd personally  do.

Apologize to her only if you seek to be a active friend. 

Now that the situation  has happen... learn from it so you dont need to seek an answer like this from anyone else again."

Tried to not care too much, we are still friends to this day and she has really grown as a person and is still apologizing about back then.
It might not be you, if she doesnt know what's going on try to tell her how that makes you feel (I never did that) and let her work through her issues.
I mean, otherwise just keep away from her, completely up to you."
soc_1785353,socialskills,reddit_comment,525,"Diagnosed with ADD (which is the same as ADHD now I've heard) and I have that same thing with family. My brother is also very charismatic . He can tell you lies and make you believe it. So me going blank on the hot seat has been suffering. I never get in an argument with him cause I never win ( or I feel I never will even if I'm right sometimes). My kind of coping for this is to never argue with him and just nod (uhuh)

My girlfriend is someone who considers it critical what opinions people hold and so if I don't really agree with her then I have to spend time defending by believes . Thankfully she is very sweet enough to wait around for when my words ""click"" and that's spend by talking for atleast half an hour . Ofcourse this doesn't mean I am stubborn and don't agree with others, trust me I'm not like that xD my condition has taught me to be more considerate of other people's opinions. Cause I know how it feels to be unheard. ( Few pains here and there but get a partner who is willing to be patient with you though I have fought with my girlfriend alot  but we always talk it through haha)

Ultimately I've found it that in an actual professional and career related situation it doesn't matter since most decisions are up to you. Your work is proof of your credibility. Sometimes it's best to talk less and smile back  when you get the occasional condescending . It unnerves people. You can simply let people know you disagree . Let them think you're unreasonable because arguing is often unnecessary and results speak for themselves. Being publicly thought of as smart is often stupid. You'll impress people not only for your hidden smarts but your capacity to listen even if it's forced. 

If when you feel the need to fight this issue then Carry around sources and notes for big talking points so they can talk for themselves and you don't have to (just make an opening statement and about them and go, here see this). Also an activity that you can calm your mind is so so so very essential for your ADHD. I couldn't advocate meditation quite enough. Me just have a 5 minute breathing and mental focus session clears up the brain fog so much before a stressful conversation. It's like finding out a godly power you have had all this time but is just normal brain clarity when you know something xD. Nowadays I don't think it's a bad thing. Your ADHD makes the way you look at things unique . 

Also for those who aren't diagnosed, get it diagnosed early . Not in my country but I know in the US (since I studied) you get alot of concessions made for you that help you perform better in alot of environments. If you are like me and struggle with time management then understand what's available for you and you'll thrive . Hope even a single bit of advice clicks for you. Take care ."
soc_1132377,socialskills,reddit_comment,189,"I agree with you. It should (in a perfect world) but the fact is it's not.  One of the perhaps annoying and perhaps excellent things about making friends is conforming to 'individuals' styles'. Ie there is no 'one size fits all'. 

So that dude's particular 'friend style' does not include use of the term 'love'. Yours does.  

Neither are wrong,  just different. 

If you want a friend who says 'i love you' like in this example,  you'll need to make a new friend. We certainly can't expect people to change who they are for our needs. If they do,  great, but we can't expect it.

Here's a tip for you.  To sound less judgemental about others, try replacing 'should' with 'could'. 

""Love COULD be shared and given freely and without judgement..""

Otherwise you're judging him for not being open to use of the word love. Friends accept friends for who they are, so by 'shoulding' him to be open to that love term, you're saying who he is intrinsically, is wrong. Maybe one day he'll be there,  maybe not, but he's valid either way. Just something to think about."
soc_351879,socialskills,reddit_comment,286,"Sure. Of course it is challenging. Anything worth doing always is. But there are two things to consider.

First is that you could do nothing because it would probably take you 4 to 5 years of serious study in order to be able to really hold your own in a fight with a much bigger guy. That is the reality.

However, as we have identified, a lot of this is ""theater"" after six months of solid study, you will feeling enough more confident in how carry your self that many people expect the most obvious will sense, ""don't mess with her""

Then there is the other side of this. Try this for incentive.

Sit down now and starting yesterday, working backwards to 6 months ago, write a list of every time someone did something that you didn't want them to do. That they said words that  either hurt or that you simply didn't want to hear. That you went along with something that you didn't want to, simply because you didn't feel able to not.

Now, with each of those events, imagine your self saying ""NO. "" might be a ""no thank you"" or a ""no fucking way"" or a ""this stops right now or you are going to be crawling out of here with your testicles in a jar in your coat pocket""

How does that feel.

Consider what your life will be like if you have a choice whether or not any of those things ever happen again.

Docile is easy, you give all the life choices to someone else. Much much harder is deciding to shape your life to be how you want it, including not putting up with assholes.

Think about one case that has been in the news where am 11yo girl was gang raped and videotaped.

It's the same thing.  So if you need to talk about your life,get a therapist, if you can't do that, then be wary of disclosing everything to friends all at once.. Start with little pieces and see the reaction if they can handle it or maybe they will even open up to you about their own lives.  Most of my friends can NOT handle any thing hard, except if it happens to them.  I do have one friend I was able to open up to but they are few and far between.

You did not fail by fucking up in some random ass social situation (which, by the way, has absolutely 0 consequences). In fact the opposite. What you did today was the start of what’s called exposure therapy, which is a massive step especially doing it without being forced to by a therapist or parent. 

Not gonna lie from reading your experience you sound pretty much exactly how I felt before doing therapy and taking antidepressants (and how I now feel once again after stupidly stopping the antidepressants). When starting exposure therapy, you should have a baseline anxiety level that is at least manageable, and from how you describe it, it does not sound manageable. I suggest talking to a doctor or psychiatrist and at least discussing medication (not benzos). Now with COVID you can easily schedule online appointments which for me is much less intimidating. 

People (like myself) always tend to look at medication like antidepressants as a last resort, because of bullshit societal messages that you can do anything if you try hard enough. After trial and error I realized that’s bullshit. Would you judge a visually impaired person for wearing glasses? Would you judge a person with an infection for using antibiotics? Then why the fuck would you judge yourself for needing medication to repair a CHEMICAL IMBALANCE? Anyway sorry for the rant, just my two cents

soc_1839663,socialskills,reddit_comment,319,"Few things here I can talk from my experience  
1. Depends what city/environment you're from. Some countries and cities are much simpler with that and people are friendly and want to hang out all the time. In others meeting once a few months is considered ""friendly"", so it depends on your needs and frequency of interactions  
2. From my experience, the more I push on the friendly angle and really try to explain it's important to me - the more it pushes people away. It's still frustrating to me, but I can get that basically people just want to hang out and have fun. If I want to hang out once every week and you keep initiating stuff all the time and asking me to hang out - it will push me away, so you need to feel that out
3. Generally people are not often initiative, even if they are really good friends, because only a handful of people in general take initiatives, so you shouldn't expect that either, that's just sadly how it is
4. Feel free to reach out if you wanna try to be friends, I relate a lot to what you've talked about and we can try to get to know each other  

Either way, best of luck with your searches, don't give up. More often than not you're just not surrounded by the right people for you that makes it frustrating for both you and them, and there might be a place where you feel welcomed and valued instead, and people share your values with deep talks, hanging out a lot, and initiating more hanging out - it's up to you to sit down, write down what's important for you in a friendship, what expectations you have from others, what is not being fulfilled and why, and then doing something with that information, and seeing how those needs are met in other places"

At the same time it can't feel like you're the only one who cares about the relationship. Does this person respond when you text? Or does that take forever too?

I'm not saying being raised by women always leads to struggle for young men, but I see it a lot. Men should not be obsessed with their body images nearly as much as they are these days. The harsh reality, whether we like it or not, is that RIGHT NOW men are judged based off of what they provide materially, where as women are judged more off of what they bring physically/sexually. You'll see ugly guys with attractive women all the time, but rarely do you see ugly girls with very attractive men. Is it right? Is it wrong?

Some conversations do require thinking, especially more nuanced conversation or intellectual conversation, but the average everyday conversation can be hurt by too much thought in the moment.

If you can learn to just say whatever comes to mind, and I don't mean whatever you think about coming to mind but literally what pops into your head, then banter can get much easier. Think of it like seeing. When you look at something you don't spend much time processing what you are looking at. Banter can sort of be like that, something in the moment that doesn't use too much thought.

That said one usually suggested piece of advice is that when you don't know what to say questions can be useful. But you can't just only ask questions, you have to share too in a similar way that your asking the other person to share.

Then you just have to practice. No matter how much you prepare social situations require practice to be comfortable in them and talking freely."
soc_1438269,socialskills,reddit_comment,120,"Sheesh. How does she even contact this brand new person she hardly knows 'in passing?' And if that actually happened, you'd think her NEXT thought would be to mention it to you, because, OBVIOUSLY.

It's up to you if you want to continue this friendship -- if you don't feel ready to break it off you can just downgrade her, de-emphasize her enough that she's a very minor person. 

Although if she pushes for more long calls/talks about her issues, I think I'd say, ""Hey, I'm no longer your emotional support animal. When I make the 'A-List' in your life let me know.""

Snarky, I know, but I'm feeling all aggravated on your behalf. What she did is NOT cool."
soc_298791,socialskills,reddit_comment,342,"Your university years are probably the first time you are plunged into social situations where you don't have the comfort of your established friends being around.

Its also a time when everyone is exposed to radically different personalities, and learn that some people are quiet or introverted, and others are the life of the party. It doesn't mean you cant join in, just don't hide in your room because that instantly rules out any social activity, and it will become much more difficult to rectify it later

Uni years can easily be the best years of your life, but it's up to you to seize it. Its ok to be quiet or introverted, and even if you are boring, just join in and be part of it anyway. 

Also don't kid yourself. Once uni is out of the way, your adult life will not a cocoon where you can hide away and avoid all social interaction. You will need to deal with people on a daily basis in employment and so this is the time you should use to become accustomed to that, no matter how difficult it feels. It will only get more difficult in later life if you dont use this opportunity.

Sorry its not the advice you wanted, but you CAN turn this around into something positive.

Just remember, that vast majority of people at uni are looking to make new friends. 
The confidence they seem to exude is quite often fake and just an act. Not a bad thing, confidence is often faked. 
But many of them will be just as insecure as you, although maybe you aren't dealing with it quite as well.

Maybe think about some circumstances where you would feel comfortable, sometimes its a social setting where you feel you arent being scrutinised, whether its a cinema, or a quiet bar etc, and then try to arrange a night out with your flatmates on those terms. It will probably help you to feel more comfortable once you've had a few fun nights out with them

soc_164232,socialskills,reddit_comment,425,"I can only speak from my perspective, but I'm assuming at least a couple of people on your team share it.

I eat everything. I like meat. I like pasta. I like veggies.

That said, I would not like to go to a place called Veggie Grill. I've been to a few similarly named places, and have never had food that I would want to eat again.

This could have been some of your teammates' thought processes as well.

It's not about whether Veggie Grill or Olive Garden can or can't accommodate you, it's about what kind of food *they* want to eat. Unfortunately for you, they did not want to eat at Veggie Grill.

If you were driving and they didn't let you go to Veggie Grill to get something to go, then yes, that's shitty on them, and you should have gone anyway. If you were not driving, then you have much less say in the matter and effectively have to go along with the driver's choice or majority opinion.

Society is held together by loose rules that change over time. You can't easily say where compromise should enter in for either party. It's based on a lot of factors, a large one being - how many people agree with you vs. disagree with you.

It sounds like in this situation you were alone vs many others. In that case, you're almost always going to be the one compromising. That's the nature of social dynamics.

In the future, you have a couple options:   
1. Try to get one, two, or more people to agree that you should go to a vegan-friendly place. Even if you have just one person on your side, your argument will hold a lot more weight than if you're alone.  
2. Go somewhere else by yourself. Assuming you weren't driving, walk.  
3. Bring food with you. Carry around some vegan food so you're not put in a situation like this where you can't order from the menu.  
4. Suck it up and deal with the fact that being a vegan is your choice. Many parts of the country and world are decidedly not vegan-friendly. If you are a vegan, then the fact of the matter is...you'll have to deal with this sort of thing again. Evaluate why you are vegan and whether it is worth it.

Lastly - social interactions are often much less logical than you'd like.  You'll have to get used to it if you want to be more social.

Edit: I fully agree with [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/34631v/how_do_you_guys_put_up_with_being_required_to_eat/cqrllnw) post."
soc_1138688,socialskills,reddit_comment,254,"Please don't crucify me everyone but don't listen to what women say they want to see. Lets be honest a woman would find it incredibly insulting if I began to opine on what it meant to be a woman so lets drop this double standard immediately.

You live in an untidy room? Clean it up. I am surprised/disappointed I need to say this. At the very least make your bed every morning, it'll give you a little win straight up to start the day and getting into a made bed at the end of the day is always a little bit nicer. Wash your sheets weekly too.

You can't cook? Learn. Don't be so fucking lazy - Never before in the history of humanity has information been so accessible.

You lack discipline? Discipline is a skill you train like training for strength. It's not something innate you are born with nor is it something you can develop overnight. Don't hate yourself or put yourself down as you learn, self hate is incredibly unproductive.  
Lacking self confidence? I believe self confidence comes from achievement. But you get to decided what you achieve, maybe keeping your room clean for a month is a big achievement for you, great, celebrate it. Don't compare yourself to others, only you know whats hard for you and what is initially hard for you will become easy with time.

soc_1713,socialskills,reddit_comment,115,"In my opinion you're over thinking how much they care.  They made the offer, and would expect some people to come in and not commit.  What is said is up to you, if it's done with a smile and politely then everything ends up fine.  They offered a service, you weren't satisfied with it, and now you're well within your right to decline, no pressure or awkwardness necessary.

Examples of how I would do it, ""Thanks anyway, but I am gonna shop around some more.""  ""Thanks, but I'm gonna look elsewhere.""  Simple is all that's necessary. There's a chance they might be disappointed, but it won't ruin their day, and they certainly won't hate you.   "
soc_869660,socialskills,reddit_comment,133,"Being afraid of losing connections is unhealthy, this applies to both friendships and a relationship especially for males. Initiate once in a while, usually up to 3 times max as a rule of thumb if they don't give a valid reason they can't hang out with you. If you get ghosted or a response of something along the lines of ""I can't but I'll let you know"" and never get a response back then simply move on.

Why would you want to hang out with someone who doesn't want to? You can't get too attached to people like that. There's always another friend to make or girl/guy to meet. Being afraid is a sign of insecurity. Don't be afraid to lose people. People come and go in your life and that's just life."
soc_17632,socialskills,reddit_comment,290,"I'm the EXACT same as you (except I usually refuse to admit we're both right). People say I'm relentless and narrow-minded even though I'm trying to have an intellectually stimulating arguement and try to use facts and logic. 

Personally, I think people who like to debate/argue are hard to like. People have a variety of beliefs about different things even if they're complete rubbish. But lots of people don't want to constantly be corrected on their stupid opinions, they'd rather keep them and be ignorantly happy. They are likely to go super-defensive and make up complete crap in order to protect their views and don't see these situations as an opportunity to exchange opinions or ideas.

On coming to that realisation, it became easier to avoid arguements because I stopped caring about trying to persuade the other person. My pride is in myself and I know I'm right, so it's fine. You have to trust in yourself that you're not narrow-minded are are simply an intelligent guy who likes to argue (it's not a bad thing). 

But then, if you want to maintain friendships with these people you have to decide. Either stop arguing so much and be happy knowing you're right in your head (you'll have to do things such as changing the subject or simply not voicing your conflicting opinions), or find better friends. Personally I find that with such people I just maintain a shallow relationship and make my close relationships with the people that actually know the rules of arguing and debating. 

If you're reliant on these friends, maybe keep them sweet until you get the opportunity to make friends with people that are more like you. 

My opinion, anyway. Dont know if its relevant :)"
soc_1065322,socialskills,reddit_comment,873,"Ok, my answer got really long. I know I missed stuff too but I people will comment with other ideas too. 

Generally speaking, most people, even ones who seem chatty find starting conversations just as awkward. Seriously, you're not alone. 

Not sure what level of familiarity we're talking about here but here is my survival experience as a painfully introverted person who was excellent at being invisible to suddenly being put in front of a live TV camera twice a week, promoted, and sitting in on board meetings. 

Quest - Small Talk Legs
Learning to turn it on. That's how I think about it. I can't be ""on"" or social all the time, it's draining to me. But creating habits make it easier. If you're just not experienced yet, it'll become habit and no big deal. 

Prep - What's your face and body language saying? I know I have a serious resting bitch face. And my thinking face looks like I'm thinking, ""are you really that dumb?"" Even when I smile my mouth just makes a straight line. HA! But, being aware of this, relaxing my frowny eyebrows and adding what feels like a big smile but only shows as a polite, neutral face, is part of my habit of ""turning it on."" I'll make jokes about it too if I think someone may misinterpret it like, sorry, this is my thinking face. It doesn't like to convey what's going on up here. Most laugh. If you're not sure, ask. Good friend, family, therapist, co-worker. Just don't get defensive. 

Observe - Watch people who are where you want to be. Also watch the people around them. Are they really enjoying it or are they just putting up with it. My favorite person to emulate always made people feel heard by physically turning in their chair to face someone and had a reassuring smile. Like she was your parent or bestie there supporting you. 

Start - I found the easiest place to start was before any actual conversation. Passing people on the street, in the hall at work, make quick eye contact and say hello, morning, whatever feels right. It can be 1 millisecond eye contact, the awkward twitching smile and mumbled hi. That's fine, you'll get better. At work or school, this goes a long way too making you seem more approachable too. 

Level up - Throw in a comment, compliment. Say you're in the break room, they're heating up a diet meal, say that smells good, are they any good? Home cooked, oh that smells good, what is it. Other quick, low anxiety opportunities: weather is stereotypical small talk for a reason. You come inside, wow it's really windy. Or ask someone who just came in, what's it like out there? Then there's compliments. If course keep it neutral so it doesn't seem creepy. Don't be like nice shirt and look at a woman's shirt. It'll come across as boobs, always (unless you know them well enough) Instead if you notice a new hair cut just say in passing, I like the new hair. Generally safe is something flashy like a bright coat, scarf, shoes, something on they're desk. Ask leading questions like, those boots are awesome or my sister (don't lie, real people) would like a coat like that, where'd you get it. Your plant looks great, I don't have a green thumb, how often do you water it. Most people are happy to talk about these kinds of things. And if not the interaction is short anyway. No harm, no foul. 

Level up - Learn their name. Or at least don't feel awkward about asking for it no matter now long you've talked to or known them just ask. hey, I didn't catch your name or what was you name again? They can then ask yours too. Or even... This one is scary and awkward but if you really want to get there... that person you end up with on the elevator or in the break room with often, say Hey, I see you in here all the time but we haven't formally met. I'm Mike from sales, what's your name? [person gives name] Repeat their name (helps with memory) then either stay formal with a, well nice to officially meet you or a jokey/awkward, cool, see you around, bye [name]. 

Achievement - Combine them. You might feel like a cheesy sales man but if you're genuine that will pass. (Plus there's a reason sales people are taught similar techniques.) Hey Mike. Nice day out. How's Fido. Those new shoes? Noice! 

Awkward avoidance: It's ok to keep it short. Longer convo doesn't necessarily mean quality. Learn some graceful ways to exit for when it is starting to seem awkward and when you really do need to leave. Say something like, Well, I should get going. Thanks for the info on the food/coat/thing. 

PRO TIP: It's not ""uncomfortable silence"". It's just a break in conversation. Let's everyone think. Not gonna lie, it's powerful once you get comfortable with it.

soc_95378,socialskills,reddit_comment,333,"Call them out on it. I think the biggest reason white people do this (and I've probably been guilty myself) is that they're trying to show that they're comfortable with you.

I know that sounds odd. But the whole ""white guilt"" thing is definitely real for a lot of people. And it sounds counter-intuitive when you think about it logically, but by saying that they're trying to show that they like you enough that they don't have to walk on eggshells around you.

Is it stupid? Yeah. Is it racist? I don't know. But in general white people are taught to avoid the race issue altogether. Pretend that it's not there. It's part of the whole ""color blind"" campaign. But, of course, it is there. It doesn't mean your race (or anyone's) is an issue to them, but nobody is truly ""colorblind.""

So my advice: If it actually offends you, then tell them that. If you think they're actually racist and judging you based on the color your skin, tell them to fuck off and don't talk to them anymore. If it's harmless, then why does it bother you?

Racism is still alive and well. It's disgusting and should not be tolerated. Some of your examples could be that, or they could be harmless. It's hard to know out of context. Ultimately it's up to you to decide if what these people are saying is truly racist, or if it's just friends teasing each other.

For instance, I'm white. My wife is Persian. I've teased her with terrorist jokes in the past, which in retrospect is awful and unacceptable, but at the time I thought I was just being funny. And I've teased her about Persian's affinity for gold and purple (like when I see her cousins' wedding photos), which I think is harmless.

This post turned out a lot longer than I thought it would, but basically: not everything is black and white, you have to decide if it's okay or not."

i can’t say whether or not it “matters” because that’s not for me to determine. if it matters to you, communicate about it. i personally touch base with my friends weekly and they do the same, but that’s just me and my friends."
soc_1523795,socialskills,reddit_comment,194,"Having a shitty social interaction definitely sucks. But let me play devils advocate here and possibly open up a new perspective. 

Nobody is entitled to another humans attention or politeness. Ive seen quite a few of these posts and I apologise for generalising but, it's always a woman being upset that a man didnt give her attention. 

It sounds like this dude was being rude, and he wasn't perfectly sharing his attention between everyone. But that doesn't make him a jerk, or an asshole. Feeling entitled to another persons affection just for existing makes someone an asshole. Not everyone is going to like you, don't sweat on it. It's not his job to make everyone happy and it's not your job to make everyone like you. 

This post feels like you're asking for advice but blaming someone else. Are you interested in what you might have done wrong, or are you looking for a reason that he's an asshole to protect your own ego. (Clarification) im autistic and I fumble social situations all the time so I'm desensitised to the concept of it being my own fault. I realise not everyone has that though."
soc_311771,socialskills,reddit_comment,220,"&gt;&gt;*However the last time I talked to a girl I just stood there **uncertain about what to say** and **sweating**. *She was looking at me like i had a booger on my face* 

No, she was looking at you like you had sweat on your face and body and stood there like a weirdo.

&gt;&gt;Finally, I stammered out something about my work that day ""Did you know nuclear power is super safe?"" ....Can't she see I'm offering a higher level of intellectual discussion? I could talk about science and health all day with here, but she talks about some celebrity shit. 

You don't start a discussion by saying, ""Hey, I work in this as a job and I'm right. Why won't you discuss it with me so I can remind you how right I am?"" Imagine someone comes up to you and starts talking about how we need to save our troops and how wonderful the military is and how he's been working for in the military and it's great; even if that sounds like an excuse for a discussion, does it sound like he'll like your response?

soc_1236218,socialskills,reddit_comment,204,"I went through a similar experience and I know it's not easy. Firstly, you have to be strong. You said you're an athlete and one reason (or excuse) is enough for you to not smoke. Everyone js entitled to have a choice. My friends luckily never forced me to smoke because they respected my choice. Not only that, they also find it difficult to smoke in my presence because they know it's fundamentally not good for their bodies and what not. As long as your friends make you feel included and respect your choice, you have no need to let them go. That being said, if they try to force you or compel you into it, it's better if you gradually distance yourself. Believe me for two years I used to weep thinking i would never get any friends. I found a few, i have a small circle and I've been happier than I ever would've been if I had started doing that stuff. I hope you get through this.

It’s in your court now if you want to continue to be friendly or draw boundaries and not have anything to do with her. It seems like a lot of replies aren’t taking into consideration both you and her feelings into consideration. 

To you, a girl that you saw as a potential romantic relationship partner rejected you and because that happened, you don’t want to be friends with her because you have feelings for her that you know won’t be able to go anywhere. On the flip side, she liked you as a friend and still does and she wants things to return to normal.

soc_982963,socialskills,reddit_comment,678,"Hey I don't know if my comment will help you change your beliefs to align with who you want to be, but I'll try. It looks like you're at a crossroads. You're self proclaimed as part of an incel community which from what I have observed has a lot of negative attitudes about themselves and their worth, about others especially women, and about society. On the other hand you are in this community too which from what I have seen deals with some struggles that could be seen as negative, but is also a community that gives positive advice, motivation, and builds each other up to improve their outlook and themselves. 

I'm sure you've heard this before, but you become the kind of person you surround yourself with. I would understand if you feel the only social group you have is the incel community so you refuse to leave it. But I will say that from what I have seen they are not committed to changing the negativity they see in the world or lifting each other up. If you choose to stay in that community I think you will find it difficult to change your outlook, beliefs, and identity. And many people find the ideas of that community to be untrue and degrading on humanity. It is your choice if you align yourself with those beliefs, but I do not think they will help you connect with people in a fulfilling way. 

On the other hand you are already engaging in this community as well. You have found people here who want to engage with you, to discuss hard problems, and to see positive change and lift each other up. So you cannot claim that the incel community is your only choice for interaction. In fact you have found a community here. And this is not a unique place in this world. There's millions of communities that exist to lift each other up. They are not always easy to find. Especially now with COVID. I dont want to belittle you if you have struggled to find a place to be welcome. We all struggle with this. But you have to bring an open mind and respect for others to find a community to be a part of. If you carry beliefs that disparage humanity, humanity will turn away. If you come to a place where people want to help and try and shut them down, of course its not going to go well. Im not saying accept every positive thing that people say blindly. But challenge people patiently if you dont agree with all they say. Respect their thoughts and inputs. I cant promise it will always be a positive interaction, but some will.

And the comment about interrogating people- You don't have to just ask questions. Ask questions to start, and then comment on their answers of course! If you can't think of anything to say at first then ask a follow up question to get more detail. You can tie their answers to your own life and thoughts and stories too. That's how you get engaged. I assume you know all of this already. I think you were intentionally trying to be difficult by oversimpifying the other person's advice. Which is why I say you should challenge respectfully if you disagree. There's no need to simply shut someone down when they were just trying to help. 

Also growing isn't just about your looks or money. If you sit down to have a conversation with someone, it doesn't matter how they look or how much money they have! Its just a conversation. Sure if you appear threatening or disinterested people will take that as a clue as how to interact with you. But if you work at being better at engaging with them, showing real interest in their words, and sharing about yourself, at the end of the day your looks dont impact a friendship. I dont know if you were talking exclusively about romantic relationships or what. Even those are only partially impacted by looks!"
soc_897930,socialskills,reddit_comment,127,"I don’t think you do though necessarily. Some people are actually okay with mediocrity and if you can live like that and be genuinely happy then more power to you. For most people though, being mediocre isn’t enough and i think it’s really about finding something that makes you happy, and proud of yourself. That can look different for different people. For example, some people feel really proud to have graduated with  a degree of some sort where others believe that learning a trade is far more valuable than a degree. Neither person is right or wrong but if they are both proud of themselves at the end of the day what does it really matter who did what? It’s just that you did something at all."

I know it’s frustrating as someone who’s trying to help, but a simple “you don’t have to talk about it, but I’m here if you want to” is perfect.

soc_1598067,socialskills,reddit_comment,382,"As someone who is really scared of taking risks, while simultaneously feeling stuck or burnt out from not taking those risks, it’s better to take those risks. I once worked full time for minimal pay. Was crying and stressed over bills. Felt like life was not what people made it out to be.

But one day, I said I’m going back to school. I was I think your age or one year older when I decided to. I made preparations and plans to try to alleviate some stress. Well a week into doing remote schooling, all my plans fell through. I still was able to continue schooling, but was now broke as hell. But guess what? I made it through. I struggled a lot sometimes, sometimes I had relatively peaceful moments for short amounts of time.

The struggle felt so much more doable compared to being stuck in a dead end time consuming, mentally and physically taxing job. Because at least this struggle was for something I really wanted to accomplish for myself! I became less hard on myself, and sometimes I’m dirt broke but I don’t give up this time. Because now I fully realize things happen all the time to impede progress, but it’s life and so not taking it personally will teach you how to take downfalls in stride and get back up.

I still don’t take all the risks I want due to anxiety but I’ll never not be proud that I took the risk of starting life over in a new city. No matter how it turns out. My advice to you is to do what you want, seriously. One reason people become bitter is for having so many regrets. I know it’s really hard when stuck in routines it seem impossible to get out of, but I read an article once that new habits can be made with consistent effort for like 3-5 weeks or something like that.

I hope you are able to take a step forward in the direction you desire. Even if you have reasons you feel like something might not work and can imagine the worse can happen, the worse can happen. But the best can too. It’s up to you to pull yourself through the up and down cycles of life"
soc_313954,socialskills,reddit_comment,277,"30 minutes is actually a pretty long conversation. A lot of people don't even like being in conversations that long, especially if it is their first time meeting you. They become uncomfortable for various reasons. They could run out of things to say or they could have low level anxiety. Many people won't be comfortable with conversations that long unless you have known them for a long time or you have built a strong connection in a short period of time via common interests or having similar personalities. I don't think you are doing anything wrong that is pushing people away, they are just getting understandably tired of the conversation (not you) and want to move on to something else. If you want to build a stronger connection with someone, take it slow. Let the first few conversations flow naturally and when it becomes obvious the person is done with the conversation (watch body/facial language), make sure YOU are the one to end it. It will seem more like you are in control of yourself and the person will appreciate you listening to their cues and be more likely to want to continue conversation later. In fact, it's usually best to end the conversation BEFORE they get tired. End on a high note, after a big laugh or something. Leave the other person wanting more! If you want deeper connections and longer conversations, it will come. Most people just need more time to warm up to you. And sometimes even close friends may not want to talk for hours, just because either they aren't into conversation that much or they may have somewhere they need to be."
soc_430658,socialskills,reddit_comment,887,"All of those things are secondary goals to improving yourself.

This seems like a lot, and it is, but it's not. It's work on one of these things at a time. Once a day, once a week, once a month. Who cares? Just do that and eventually you'll get there. I suggest going in order at least to begin with, but I think this floats together well. 

First, the easiest thing, improve your hygiene. Brush your teeth every day, make sure your skin is healthy and clean, finger nails are clean, and your hair is nice. When your mouth and body feel gross, you feel gross, because you are.

Second, your diet. Stop eating bullshit. Not all at once. A) cut out is soda. Want a soda? Chug a glass of water. Thirsty for juice or milk? Chug water first. B) avoid carb heavy food like pasta and breads. You can eat them, but the are NOT your friend at all. Always make yourself vegetables, and eat them all before you eat any other part of your food. C) If B doesn't apply, change it up. D) don't eat fast food or pizza. This helps keep your mouth and skin healthy and clean.

Third, exercise. You can lift weights, you can do cardio, you can do a martial art, swim, bike, climb. Do any of it. Just do it. And when you do keep a log of what you're doing and get a routine going. Give yourself incentives for following the routine. Have you gone to the gym for two weeks and not missed a day of your schedule (MWF split let's say), eat some of that shitty fast food you cut out in your diet.

Fourth, spend time on your hobbies. Don't have any? Find some. Need help finding hobbies? Google it. Find out what they entail. You can also start by determining what you already own that relates towards some single hobby. Don't blow $200 trying rout a hobby. Spend $20 on something, like painting supplies and use them until they're gone or broken.

Fifth, dress your best. All the time. This follows the clean mouth and body. You look good, you feel good. Get clothes that YOU like that fit you. Since you should be dieting and exercising, don't blow a ton of money on clothes (like hobbies) all at once. Shop at thrift stores, don't buy stuff brand new, because your body is going to be changing, and if you spend $100 on clothes, you're going to get discouraged to improve your aesthetics (both improving your body and improving your style). You don't want that. Don't know what styles you like or want to pursue? Google it. Instagram, YouTube, pinterst, GQ, etc. There's so much out there. Go to stores and observe people.

Six, talk to people. Standing in line at the grocery store? Ask the cashier how their day is going? Force them into a conversation because you need to practice and while it's not their job, it is right now. This is one of the best places. Be nice, encouraging, positive, and friendly.

Seven, improve your outlook. Be positive about things. Had a shitty day? Get the fuck over it. So did everyone else, and no one cares about their day, and no one cares about yours? Had a 15 hour work day? That sucks, but at some point something good happened, focus on that. Or if it didn't, find a new job or environment to work in.

Eight, remove toxic people. This one is tough, but it's easy too. Especially when you're improving yourself. You can find toxic people quick in transition phases. People will give you shit about you doing different things, those people are toxic (in general). The distinction needs to be made between constructive criticism and putting you down. People may be voicing concerns about changing because they care about YOU or they may just be talking shit bc they're projecting their insecurities outwards. Fuck those people. You know the people in your life the best, so you need to decide that. This might be your best friend, or simply a coworker, but it needs to be done.

Nine, learn to read people. This one is tough but it's essential for the previous and also subsequently dealing with new people. You can learn a lot about someone by reading them. Are they interested in speaking with you, are they mad at you or is there something going on in their life that is bigger than you and you're just inconvenient at the moment, etc. You can do this while practicing talking to people and observing people (while looking for new clothes for instance) which is helpful.

Ten, fail. You're going to do this a lot in life. Get used to it. Strive to fail. Set goals that you know are achievable but not a big deal and fail at them. Failure is rejection. Failure is being tired. Failure is pushing yourself as hard as you can, and not making it. Then accept it. All this means is that you can improve. You have a clear definition of what a better you can be.


I don't have time to finish this, was planning on adding examples. I will do that if there's interest.

Either way, good luck brother. "
soc_661372,socialskills,reddit_comment,432,"Listen to me, you can do this. Homecoming is coming close with a month away so you should talk to her when you can, at least 2 talks a week. It's during XC practice so you'll have your warm up, stretches/drills, your run, and stretching again right? I imagine that's how practice would be like or something similar, because I was in XC too! If you guys warm up and stretch all together, that's a good time to talk to her. I'd say the best time though would be after practice when everyone is dispersing, because then you could be more intimate, it's easier to spot/talk to her, and it's actually an advantage for you, because of your society anxiety. Honestly talk about anything with her: Classes, her day, the run, school, anything but the goal is to break the ice and for her to open up to you. Try to get her number in a week. Once you guys are familiar with eachother, simply ask ""hey what are you doing this weekend? I was thinking we could hangout! What's your number?"" It's not hard, just have to put in work and talk little by little.

Whenever you see her, take a deep breath in and out, (at least hold in for 5 then 7 out) walk up to her, and talk. Everything will be okay. She's like you. She's shy, you're shy, you will not look like a creep, but one of you has to make the first move and chances are, you will need to do it. To start, introduce yourself if you haven't already.

If you're feeling confident, I'd challenge or make a bet with her and lose (in purpose). Competition invites a playful chase and you're in a perfect scenario for this. Someone won't just let you say you're better than them unless proven. Tell her ""5 bucks, I bet you can't keep up with me on this run"" or ""I bet I can run more miles/intervals than you."" Heck you can even change the reward to something like ""I'll buy you ice cream"" and there's an easy hangout! Who the heck doesn't want free ice cream?

If you can for this week, I want you to choose one or two girls from a class and talk to them. Consider this an exercise to build up confidence to initiate conversation and practice flowing through topics. That way when you do see your potential homecoming date, you'll be ready.

There, I laid out the groundwork for you. You got this! Good luck and I hope you get with her!"
soc_1095356,socialskills,reddit_comment,243,"It sounds like you and your best friend have some different ideas about how you treat people. I think your gut instinct is on the right track: she seems like she doesn’t want to take ownership of her own behavior, and likes manipulating people even when she knows she’s using them. I think it’s up to you to decide that knowing this about her, do you want to still be her friend (chances are she might not change on her own, and you’ll be dealing with this later too,) do you want to end the friendship (it’s a long friendship to give up, but it might make your overall quality of life better, but there will be sadness from losing the relationship,) or do you want to have a come to jesus with her (she might not take it well, could be friendship ending. Might be beneficial and improve her behavior and your relationship.)

You have a lot of options and it’s clear you care for her, but you also deserve to put your own needs first, and the end of high school is a really convenient and easy time to start fresh with a new friend group, especially if you are going 45mins+ away for college. I also worry that she talks about you like this behind your back, and it’s really hard to trust people when you’re worried about their intentions. I hope this rambling helped a little bit. Good luck!"

Whether you wanna hook up with someone who considers that a normal not creepy thing to say is up to you, but hints don't get much clearer than that. Like in no scenario unless you're dating and had a conversation about boundaries is this a not creepy thing for her to say, and if you're not absolutely determined to get laid I would advise you to find the block button. Unless you're really just looking to hook up, I guess, in that case congrats, this girl is definitely willing."
soc_1496511,socialskills,reddit_comment,410,"It's tough to know where to strike the balance between ""practical"" and ""mean-spirited,"" in terms of being judgmental. On one hand, being able to draw conclusions on a person's character, and therefore their future behaviors, is a useful skill. Without it, you run the risk of getting tangled up with people who, intentionally or not, harm you in some way. On the other hand, being too quick to judge runs the risk of making incorrect assumptions, ones that cause misunderstandings and missed opportunities and conflicts that could've been avoided.

Maybe the first thing that might help is to give yourself more credit. I think it's a great sign that you want to be more compassionate. Some people never see the value in that. Another way to deal with your own inward-facing judgment might be to remind yourself that these things take time, and to trust that even though you'll slip up here and there, you're overall getting closer to where you want to be.

As for dealing with judgment toward other people, I've found that it helps to remember that a person's decisions and behaviors are merely a window into their character. A lot goes inside a person's head but we'll never know the whole picture, meaning any judgments we make will never be 100% correct. Maybe 2% or 98%. But never 100%. Being open to the possibility of being wrong helps me take the edge off of the initial knee-jerk reactions.

It could also be useful to set aside some time and think about what matters to you the most. I think in general people believe it's okay to do things that don't harm others. What constitutes ""harm"" is where all the trouble lies, and that's really up to you. Let's say a stranger is walking down the street wearing a Pikachu costume. Since people are giving them weird looks, maybe you'll judge the stranger as inconsiderate and making a disturbance. Or since no one's getting physically hurt, maybe you'll judge the stranger as harmless and carry on with your day.

It's really up to you to decide where you draw those lines, and once you feel confident about them, I think you'll have a clearer sense of which judgments are useful and which ones are just noise. And of course, wherever you draw your lines, there's always the chance those lines will change as your values change, so staying aware of those things helps maintain that internal peace."
soc_146676,socialskills,reddit_comment,134,"I think you need to decide where you want to go with this relationship. Do you want to date her or do you want to just be her friend? Lingering and waiting for her to break it off from the other guy is not healthy, and neither is trying to get her to cheat with you (not saying you'd plan on doing that). 

I think, then, you should talk to her about your intentions. Put the ball in her court. Let her make the decision on her own. If she decides to continue with the other guy, you have to accept that you'll only be friends with her. Otherwise, I'd advise that you break things off from her completely because mixed expectations will be bad for the both of you.

Cheers and good luck!"
soc_384082,socialskills,reddit_comment,104,"Ah, yes! For me, it’s because I feel like they may have heard the classic sympathetic words countless times.
 I know when I have something shitty happen, the constant sympathy reminds me of the situation I’m in, so when someone acts like nothing happened it’s kind of nice because things feel kind of normal again??

I know that other people (maybe a majority of people) don’t feel the same way/would rather get sympathetic words than any other reaction, but that’s just my two cents? 

Or maybe that’s just what I tell myself to avoid accepting the fact that I have trouble expressing my emotions?"
soc_324404,socialskills,reddit_comment,165,"You're scared of being seen :). And you don't want to appear nervous so you get nervous about being nervous and it's a negative feedback loop that spirals out of control. The trick is to not care about being seen as nervous - embrace your nervous self and just show up as you are... so with your heart beating hard, with a trembling voice and a racing mind - this is you, and it's completely fine.. with this attitude you'll not worry about how you're appearing so much and naturally you'll relax, without having to force it or pretend. 

Being nervous isn't really a problem, it can even be endearing if you own it. What other people think doesn't really matter, they have no power over your state of being, your happiness, etc. It's all up to you, choices you make... realizing this will stop you from worrying about other people's opinions - and put your focus on just doing what you feel is right.

soc_403655,socialskills,reddit_comment,126,"Well, you already did something small but that can help, you posted something on the internet where everybody can see it and judge, but you still did... Even if it's not your main account you took a small step out of your comfort zone. I'm trying to do the same thing here, commenting here is also a small step for my own development because even on the internet i'm socially awkward. One thing I think you shouldn't do is go after books that say ""how to influence someone into liking you"", I don't think that's how the world works, you shouldn't trick people into liking you. But it's just my opinion. Just remember, start small and keep going, it's a slow process but someday you'll succeed.  "
soc_1100707,socialskills,reddit_comment,1421,"Say there's something that you really don't love about yourself, that crushes you under its weight. It feels heavy, like you can never accept it.

This also answers your other question: ""If I've lived my entire childhood seeking a reality better than my own, how can I simply live with my current reality?""--Just remember you can be happy even if you're imperfect. Look at things in the grand scheme--the world is incredibly vast, and you are small. The reason you dislike your current reality is probably because you feel bad about the part that you, as an individual, play in that reality. Just be content with yourself and it will be easier to look outward. You're powerful and courageous, but you're simply a node in a huge network. There is no room for shame. There is no room for shame when there are many more fascinating things to think about. Don't indulge self-loathing. it's not worth it. Utterly ignore it. Banish negativity from your mind; it has no home there. It won't thrive there. It's weak. It's nothing to you. This is the most important thing to realize: you're okay. You're only human. Nobody expects you to be perfect, and if they do, then they're being unrealistic. Forgivable ignorance. A trifle. Have you ever seen someone who was so incredibly shameless, someone who could do something incredibly embarrassing and still not be ashamed? Someone who's being viciously judged and ridiculed by others but continues to stay true to themself? Look up to those people.

Okay, snack break , in the meantime watch this video (i should probably warn you, theres profanity) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQUURGS0OtQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQUURGS0OtQ) and be happy for this guy.

It's in your best interest to improve yourself if you're flawed, of course, because it will help make your own life and the lives of the people around you exponentially better. But this is your choice. It's a matter of choosing your consequence. Becoming confident takes some work, but such a goal would give you meaning and something worthy to strive for; besides, would you rather live your life being a deluded narcissist, someone incapable of recognizing the beauty of the world and people around them, at constant war with yourself, focusing so much inward that it drives you insane?

""Going back to the original reason why I posted this question, I'm having trouble socially with the same group of friends I mentioned. It's been about a month since I brought up my issues with them, and I'm still noticing that after a really good night out, I experience extreme social anxiety the next few days. Thanks to your advice about realizing and acknowledging tough realities. However, I am still confused as to why I feel this way in the first place. Am I subconsciously deluding myself into believing I can act confidently and have a great time with friends? Is the painful reality only setting in the next day because I deluded myself so well?""

If this were me, I would start by asking myself what exactly it is that I'm afraid of. When you feel social anxiety, what exactly is it that you're afraid of other people thinking? And is this worthy of distressing over? Undoubtedly it isn't; because shame is useless. Think back to what I said earlier. You, yourself, are acceptable. Confidence is just realizing you are. Even though it's okay for you to be imperfect; in the face of the vast world and the fantastic things you can experience in it, it's a small afterthought. Banish hatred from your mind. 

Maybe the shame you're feeling is just a result of you believing you're someone you really aren't. Maybe you feel sick at the thought of yourself.

I don't know what you mean when you say ""after a really good night out, I experience extreme social anxiety the next few days."" does this mean that during the night out, you felt happy, carefree, and confident, and then the days after you thought you had made a fool of yourself and you felt embarrassed? Because this is normal of course, for self-loathing perfectionists and overthinkers, even though it's useless and not to be desired. The key is to be glad that the night happened. That's all. Be glad that you had fun, be glad that you got to be around your friends, because your friends make you happy, and you make your friends happy. This is a very easy mindset to fall into if you're content with yourself. If you have a hard time consciously falling into that mindset, then you know the problem.

Maybe try rewording this question if my answer wasn't good enough. It vexes me for some reason, but in any case, the things I mentioned earlier should help with those things. But I want to point out that you said ""acknowledging tough realities""--acknowledging something is true comes after you're not upset about it anymore. It doesn't have to be a tough reality. Maybe I used the term ""tough reality"" earlier, but be aware that I only meant the word ""tough"" to acknowledge how the truth is contrary to a deluded narcissists fantasies. It's not really a tough truth. Its just a right, relieving truth, but its only relieving if you're not resistant to it. And it's okay if it's hard to accept the truth sometimes. Sometimes you just need to nudge yourself in the right direction so the truth isn't painful anymore. Sometimes, in the case of the death of a loved one, that takes time. In the case of accepting someone is better than you, that takes encouragement and self-work, but time is helpful too because growing up can help you mature into your own self-assurance. Once the reality that someone is better at something than you becomes an alright reality, its a lot easier to accept it. Which is extremely freeing. But it doesnt have to be okay right now. This phase is about nudging yourself in the right direction and enjoying the improvements you see over time. You don't have to rush yourself, and if you find yourself overthinking, then remember your own peace and calm should be cherished. If this is distressing you, take a step back and dont think about it for a few days. Just observe indifferently, acknowledge your own emotions and be alright with them. Focus on banishing hatred and accepting and understanding the people around you, even if you dont like everything about them. I like to repeat the phrase ""I am love"" to myself. The most important thing is to never blame yourself for your own natural thoughts and emotions, for no other reason than because it's ridiculous and irrational to do so. Its an unnecessary disservice to yourself.

 ""As a side note, we've (as in my friend group) been talking a lot about this person we know (who I'll call Steve). Steve has quite a bit of social anxiety just like me, but he also does things that go beyond just social-anxiety-induced behavior (e.g. he asked a girl-who already had a boyfriend and with whom he was not close with-for her bra size). Also, unlike me, he refuses social advice from others, deluding himself into believing that he's always right.

I mentioned Steve because he makes me feel conflicted about myself. I consciously want to hate or at least dislike him for the things that he's done, but at the same time, if I do that, it'll be like me hating myself if you get what I mean. A lot of the mistakes that he made, I made also, but my reaction to those mistakes were just different. Should I sympathize with him? I wonder if a part of me doesn't actually care about his sexually aggressive (or otherwise overly weird) behavior and simply hates him because he embodies my past self. When we meet each other in person, the narcissist side of my brain can't help but rejoice in the fact that I am socially superior to him, but I feel like doing so also implies that he (and by extension my past self) is unacceptable and not worthy of love. Sorry if this is very confusing to read. I'm actually quite confused at my own thoughts. Thanks again, and I totally understand if it takes you a while to respond.""

Best thing I can tell you about this is: don't involve hatred in this situation. Dislike Steve's behavior because the harmful nature of it irks you, not because you hate the person doing it."

I used to read that subreddit, but it seems only out of desperation. Then I got out of my head and grew up. People aren't hard wired in a way where you can life hack it, everyone is different and you have to learn to start treating people normally. If you have friends that's good practice on how to treat a girl you like. I mean it's up to you to follow the peoples advice on there, but i think most of it will just make you an ass hole. I think a good thing to do is to identify what you don't like about yourself and work on it one by one. Life is hard and I would focus on disciplinary ways for yourself to gain favorable traits, interests or hobbies rather than trying to seduce someone. Girls are not toys or robots that react a specific way to stimuli. Flirting with people can be awkward at any time.

Like, how often do you go to a bar and have multiple people come up to you and comment (sometimes very lewdly) on your physical appearance? How often are you catcalled on the street? How many times has someone tried to use you for just your body, or objectified you? I don't mean those to be inflammatory questions, I'm just genuinely saying that's, I think, one of the reasons it's different for men and women. I think men like hearing 'hey sexy' or 'hey handsome' because that isn't something they probably get much in real life. Versus how women are *constantly* objectified based on their physical appearance, so another guy commenting on it on an app is just white noise at best, annoying at worst. "

Just because you're in a public place, even a place that is for socialization doesn't mean you yourself are required to participate in the socialization if you don't want to. A lot of socialization today feels forced, rehearsed, draining, repetitive, annoying you name it. (I don't know if I'm saying this because I work with the general public or because I'm very introverted and don't like people). People sometimes take advantage of these types of benign social situations and they don't always have the best intentions. Some will go as far as to put you on the spot to make you feel like you have to participate in socialization or interact with them and will alienate, isolate and sometimes take it personally even if you just simply don't have the desire to. I don't know what the OP's intentions were but I wouldn't have walked up to a stranger and just started conversation with them. I'm not a people person either so I would definitely hate it if I was approached by a stranger even if it's ""just for a chat"".

soc_1009409,socialskills,reddit_comment,410,"Yoo this entire interaction is a dumpster fire.

If I can step in for just one moment - both of you have valid points. I think one thing that /u/spurrit is attempting to convey is that there can be a subtext of malicious intent with the way things are said/reacted to, and that subtext of malicious intent can escalate. Thus, when he cited things about people calling the cops as a prank, it's simply an escalation along the same mindspace of malicious intent that he may be assuming from the girl in OP's interaction. Not saying it's a fully reasonable or unreasonable assessment... but more on that later.

/u/askmeifiplaythetuba, you also make a good point. People do get weirded out, it's a normal phenomenon of life... And she has a right to react. And, honestly, the way she reacted may have been standard for her and her background and how uncomfortable she felt. But that said, I think the tone and escalation in which it's reacted to is also something of question. OP did state that this girl said it ""in a grossed out tone,"" (and also loud enough for OP to hear from presumably a decently large distance) which probably a) wasn't completely necessary, and b) could be grounded in the malicious intent of shaming OP for his misfortunate situation in an effort to *insert motivation here.* 

Now, I'm not saying that's necessarily the case, but I think that's the perspective that /u/spurrit is coming from. And, based on his personal experiences, it's not completely ungrounded. Manipulation and malice have a strong effect on the mind's ability to trust and be optimistic, and even the most self aware take years to heal from it and see people optimistically - especially when a situation arises that triggers memories of a time one was manipulated or purposely hurt.

You both have reasonable points at the core of your arguments. She could have handled it a bit better (eg. she could have very easily just whispered it to the person sitting next to her, or broken eye contact and ignored it) , but she's a school girl, and honestly these nuances of social interaction aren't as well developed at the age bracket I'm assuming OP's in. He could also have handled it better, but clearly he had a brain fart moment and so he'll better understand how to handle it moving forward.

And there's no way to magically fix it (atleast not that I know of.) The thing that helped me was to constantly try to form new relations with people.

You (subconsciously) don't take yourself serious and as a result, nobody else does.

You place most(if not every) interaction in a comedic limelight in an attempt to have people validate you with your drug; laughter.
Masking your serious intentions with a comedic nature makes for great television and I'd probably buy a DVD of you, but the last thing somebody wants in a serious argument/discussion/consolation is the other guy taking the piss. To you, the inner message is clear. To them, it's foggy and ambiguous. How will they know you're not just being a character of yourself when you voice your legitimate concerns to them? I once had a friend remark ""Oh crap, you're being serious."" when I teared up following a pretty vicious night reminiscing about my ex. 

Don't be afraid to be the comedian, but put on your gameface when appropriate. That takes time, skill and finesse, but you seem pretty introspective already, so that won't be too much of a problem. 

As for your ambitions...

Whatever there is that makes you feel serious about yourself is completely up to you. For me, it's my dream of being a teacher and pride in my work as a physicist. If you want to make a Death Metal song and be serious about it, then do it. The first step to making the connection between you and Death Metal a serious one is to make it serious for yourself. If you believe in it, they will too.

Bottom line;

Be yourself. Not a joke of yourself.

Um, you seem kinda obsessed with stereotypes dude. This is not true at all lol. Life is a not a teenaged drama movie, everyone is different, these stereotypes really aren't productive.

It sounds like there are some women who are upset that you don't like them sexually and so, rather than admit that someone doesn't want them, decide that the reason for your lack of interest must be another factor, such as your sexuality.

Given that, if your only concern is that women might be less interested in you because people are saying that you're gay, you don't have anything to worry about (because they only believe that you are gay when you're not interested - you can always clarify this anyway, it's really not a big deal)"

Could it be that literall anything on this planet is based on \*human ethics/morality\*?

Harming other people.. is this wrong? Well, ethically/moraly yes. But let's say the other people has a gun and is threating to harm your family and friends, is it wrong now?

Let's say the other person is ""The Joker"" and is about to press on the ""Nuke the Planet"" button, is it right or wrong harming him?

Did your answer changed from ""It's wrong"" to ""Now it's right""? Wasn't it the same thing from the beginning up to the end, but the only thing that changed was the context in which we human exclusively made a few different decisions?

So could it be that it doesn't matter what ever you do, it's neither right or wrong?

So how come it there are people who think Justing Bieber is gay, while other people are loving him?

How come some people think that Hitler is the worst person ever, while others have tattoos of his belief?

See..

There are always 3 type of people, no matter what.

There are those who like you.

There are those who are neutral to you.

There are those who dislike you.

These 3 types are always around, just the amount of each type will change depending on the context, the location, the timing.

If you are within a christian church and tell them that islam is the best religion, you probably will have more people at the ""dislike"" type rather than the others. But tell this within an islamic building where people are celebrating an islamic event, you will have more people on the ""like"" type.

So..

No matter what you do..

No matter how much you try to make everyone happy and stretch and bend and manipulate and try to change yourself..

There will be ALWAYS people at the ""dislike"" corner.

So if ""haters gonna hate"" and since you can't change this universal rule and there will always be people who dislike you and think ""it's wrong""..

What's wrong in ignoring those, focus on those who like you and start naivly thinking that everything you do IS RIGHT?

If you are not only thinking about your own well and also try not to harm other people.. maybe even do things where you naivly think it's good for others, aren't you doing your best to do good to others? Even if you are not 100% successful, sometimes do mistakes and maybe some people, sometimes more sometimes less, are thinking that you are wrong and others thinking that you are right?

I for myself can tell you..

The moment I started naivly believing that whatever I do is right..

This moment I really felt freedom.

I suddenly could chill, relax and stop carrying and worring what other people might think.

I don't care anymore.. I am doing the right thing.. who are those people judging me, when they self can't do different? So let me be and do whatever I think is right."

**Damn, what do you think makes you struggle the most? is it anxiety. Because if it is, I just want to say things that helped me when I felt similar to your situation**

People that are anxious tend to be hyper-critical of themselves and all their mistakes.

### 1.) No need to be perfect

You are allowed, if not encouraged to make mistakes. People (I included) often go over the things they said wrong, etc. However, you can make mistakes socially just as much you can make academically.

Seeing things logically helps. When you get a question wrong on a math test, do you automatically get a 0? Of course not, you can even get a few questions wrong and still get an A. 

Try to think about what you do in a convo overall. If you're being a positive person throughout the conversation, nobody is going to think of the dumb/rude thing you said. Most of the time, you think you said something wrong, but it really wasn't.

I realize that many people assume that if others do not show a positive response to what they say, then they substitute that feeling for disapproval;/hostility. When they might have just been indifferent.

  

**2.) Girls are Usually more Nervous** 

Not trying to come off as sexist, just speaking based off what I hear, see and learned.

When guys are interested in another woman. Most of the time they need to approach to make something happen.

Most of the time it is the women dropping as many “hints” as possible to attract another man.

Women tend to be much more emotionally intelligent and connected then men. That’s why it may seem that they are so good at keeping there cool but being approached is nerve-racking for them as well.

How would you feel if a beautiful woman started talking to you out of thin air? Most would have trouble keeping their cool

Secondly, you’re in a frat, people look up to you, not the other way around. You have the “social validation”. Many other women probably assume that you’re just not interested in them and would be flattered you spoke to them.

 Key tip:

* **Catch a glance? Smile at them, if they      smile back, you’re in the clear**

**If you catch them looking at you twice, go ahead: I** realized that most women tend not to check out anything that walks by like many men do.

soc_283482,socialskills,reddit_comment,258,"I think if he were just using your for your maths answers, it would be pretty obvious. If he's willing to spend much time outside classes with you, he probably also enjoys your company. Think how much time you'd be willing to spend with someone you don't like to get their homework answers - the answer is probably not very much. 

If you are convinced he's a genuine friend, then don't resent helping him with maths! Supporting each other is a normal part of friendship. The problem here sounds like the kind of helping he's asking for (and you're giving) isn't the kind he actually needs. You're right that he needs to be able to do it himself, but giving him errors is the wrong way to achieve this. If he finds out what you've been doing, he'll be hurt, and it's unlikely to make him any better at maths anyway. Have you considered talking through the working to get the answers with him next time he asks for your work, or offering to do the homework with him so he can see what he should be doing? It's a bit of a time commitment on your behalf, so ask yourself if you're willing to make it first. If he accepts, be patient and be very careful not to be patronising. If he declines, it's up to you what to do. Bear in mind that refusing to give him your answers may upset him, and ask yourself what you'd be losing or gaining from the relationship either way."

Also, asking the staff for help would be good for social skills, but it doesn't always work out. If the staff aren't available, YouTube is your best friend. In particular I watch a lot if Jeff Nippard and Athlean X, although I have started taking Athlean X's info with. Grain of salt. He does post full workput routines though.

soc_1139950,socialskills,reddit_comment,114,"The are is no such thing as ""Creepy"" in general, the same way how word ""Big"" does not exist in general. Those are relative terms. You need a reference point to say that something is big or not.

So the same action can be ""creepy"" and ""not creepy"" it depends on the person who performs that action.

The person's behaviour can be perceived as ""creepy"" if his beliefs and his actions are NOT CONGRUENT. For example, if you are afraid to talk with people, and you still talk with them, you will be perceives as little bit ""creepy"". But if you have no doubts in yourself, then you won't be perceived as a ""creep""."
soc_1344574,socialskills,reddit_comment,191,"Honestly I don't really know how to make male friends, if there's even a guide to that, but during my lifetime I had both female and male friends so let me tell you what my experience was. The bottom line is, my female and male friendships were the exact same(at least for me). Basically, it didn't matter much wether the friend was male or female, I made them both the same way, and the experience was practically similar. We usually had similar interests like gaming or anime and it was nice, we had normal friendly fun with each other. You don't even really have to have common interest for you to become friends, there could be some other way to connect. 

My opinion about this is that there is no difference between the two. Male or female, same same. All you gotta do is talk to them just as you would talk to a female, take interest in them and get to know them as you would with any other friend. If they think it's you hitting up on them I think it's kinda dumb. Either way, it's just my opinion."
soc_1204299,socialskills,reddit_comment,297,"It depends on your age. The older you become, the less you care about what people think of you, but that's applied on general, however when it comes to social awkwardness, I relate to your feeling. People invalidate you, don't give you the place you deserve even if you are weird. Everyone deserves his/her place and we deserve respect. But people ignore us, Au contraire they enjoy to be around people with great social skills. 
So, we actually do care and must care what people think about us on that level.


It's sad because we have so much to give, we are ready to make friends but they cast us away and by them, I mean the entire society. 
That happens at my apartment building, anytime I call the landlord I have to remind her my name and give details so she can finally remember. And I have been living there for 1 year now!

It's as if you are pointless and have no social value in their interactions.

It's frustrating and sad, but it we rage in public, things can get worse. You'll lose the remaining little value they place on you. You'll come across as weird and even mentally unstable. Not a formal, mature person.So if you are over 30, stay calm, work on this issue, speak confidently, no one will beat you for speaking clear and loud no matter the environement you are in and the people you are surrounded with.

soc_1747836,socialskills,reddit_comment,164,"I see exactly where you’re coming from. There’s plenty of people in the comments defending it, but on some level social awareness is a factor.

For example, he should be socially aware that not everyone wants to get a phone call or has time for it. Texting is more convenient for both parties more often than not.

I would see this as time consuming and maybe even needy because it sort of demands your attention. I don’t want you to spontaneously call me and take 20 minutes out of my day when you could just text and not take any of my time. That may be a selfish way to see it, but everyone is different. Ultimately, my way of communicating is not inconvenient, whereas the phone calls are.

So I would just say equally “I don’t really like phone calls, I’d prefer text.” If they make an effort then they’re a good friend. If they continue calling only then I would get annoyed."

My own personal obstacle is being a little one-eyed handicapped retard with hearing aids so even if I contribute something relevant, concise, and on point to a conversation, people are socially trained to automatically dismiss and ignore the contributions of the genetically inferior.  Simply look in the mirror, focus on your lack of physical defects, and try some one-off experiments with strangers on the bus or at a library.  You'll discover that people will warm up to you and milk you for more conversation simply because your normal appearance makes them feel good about themselves.  Good luck!"

I let it go on way longer than I should have, mostly due to not wanting  to rock the boat. I was absolutely miserable. What I finally did was say to myself, “ I’m no longer going to tolerate this treatment, “ So, I confronted her about it (through message ) and told her treatment of me was unacceptable,if I did something to upset her then directly tell me,and if it continued I was done with our friendship. She denied treating  me badly ,however I still talk to her, and she hasn’t treated me that way since. 

Ignoring it isn’t the answer, it builds up negative feelings. I suggest telling them that you will no longer tolerate the put downs. It’s up to you if you would like to remain friends with them. You could also ask them why they feel the need to put you down and to please stop because it isn’t funny.

I’ve been to a few bars alone and sometimes I was bored, other times I met someone and enjoyed myself.

soc_803351,socialskills,reddit_comment,426,"Look, you’re afraid of the pain but it’s necessary. Let’s be totally honest, if you go for it there’s a low chance that you not only get this perfect girl but that you stay with her forever. It’s reality. But what happens every time another perfect girl comes along? (Because I guarantee you there will be more) will you keep running? Look at yourself in 30 years if you follow this path and tell me if that’s the life you want to live. At some point you will have to take the jump.

And failure will hurt. It hurts like a bitch, I’ve been through so many and I can tell you it doesn’t get any easier, but without it you can’t move forward. You can’t get stronger. You can’t become a better man for when you finally meet the One and you start seeing her.

If there’s one thing I regret it’s not dating girls sooner, because of all the “miss perfect”s I’ve been with, there were some that I have a hard time forgetting because if I’d had more experience, I wouldn’t have made the same mistakes, and I’d still be with them.

You need to experience pain so that you can grow as a man and become a good enough man to satisfy your eventual “miss perfect”. The longer you wait, the more of them will pass you by.

Edit: in terms of the talking, start slow. Don’t try to rush it and approach her on a whim. Don’t try to engage conversation when it’s forced and you have nothing to talk about. Just give a light, small smile when you pass by her and see her reaction. Ask her for things like the time, the date, homework pages, etc. Then you can move on to small jokes or compliments. Test the waters to build yourself confidence in talking to her until it becomes natural and eventually when something you say sparks her interest, she’ll engage in a conversation by asking you something about it and from then on it’s up to you what you want to say. Think about your responses, take your time. Don’t be afraid to say “hmm,” and ponder what she’s asking. It makes her want to hear what you have to say because it leaves her waiting and wanting. But always remember to look her in the eyes when you start talking to her(you can look away when you’re thinking) and keep a positive expression. Let her feel like you understand her, and most importantly, LISTEN TO HER."

I suggest you put yourself out there more and don’t just wait for people to come up to you, take baby steps though and don’t get discouraged because keep in mind not everyone is gonna wanna fwy but that’s okay because not everyone can like you, doesn’t mean anything is wrong w/ you. try to be the person with good energy and spreading positivity, when you’re tryna get to know someone really be interested in them and make them feel important, be kind to everyone, don’t be afraid to vulnerable, and please be yourself, no one wants to be around someone that has to lie to kick it.

Because usually they're the ones that help you a great deal down the road. In terms of emotions of course. I say that because I think most women are more emotionally inclined than some men, and they can help you with emotional ruts and can give you a confidence boost too. Women tend to notice things more and can really help you improve. 

Having a couple of them wouldn't hurt. And who knows, they might help with relationship/marriage in case any issues come down the road. I know they helped me. I only have one good lady friend, and I'm working on a few more. But it just takes a long time, because it's different with them.

soc_38159,socialskills,reddit_comment,440,"First off, only debate people who enjoy debating, and don't take it personally. Sounds like you two are of that type, but just always keep that in mind.

One of the best tactics I've found for this is to use expressions like ""my understanding is that ___"", ""my opinion is that ____"", ""my experience is that ___"", ""I could be wrong, but my perspective is ____"", etc.

The point is, it is really hard for me to debate what your opinion might be, or your experience. If you tell me something is your experience, I'm not going to tell you that it really is *not* your experience. How the heck could I know? By the same token, I'm also not likely to get very offended by it. Your experience is that all the black people you know are lazy? Well, how can I get offended by what you have experienced? It's not like you are saying that your experience is the same as my experience, or that your experience applies to everything.

You also have to realize, that by attacking someone's core beliefs and values, you are indeed attacking them personally. I may not attack you by name, but if I try argue that everything you believe in is incorrect, wrong, or bad, then I have essentially argued that you as a person are incorrect, wrong, or bad. This is why religion and politics are very delicate subjects that should not be discussed around most people.

For example, I am an Atheist, but I rarely talk about it. My GF is strongly Christian so this is a constant balancing act on my part. Simply expressing my own personal beliefs can effectively be a personal attack for many people, depending on how I word it. When I do actually discuss this with very religious people, I am sure to say things like ""I don't feel like I have experienced God, which is why I don't believe in him"". This is all at least in some way true, and it gives an ""out"" to the person I'm talking to: it allows them to say to themselves ""well, if he had seen what I have seen, then he would believe in god"". It allows them to *try* and see things from my perspective, which a personal attack never accomplishes. Contrast this with me saying ""I don't believe in god because there is no proof he exists"". That statement has nothing to do with my personal experience, and is a direct attack on anybody who feels they *have* experienced proof that he does exist (I am telling them that their personal experience is wrong)."

When I first started EMDR, however, my therapist did mention that sometimes it doesn't work for some people and it depends on your traumas.

But there are strategies people like us can put in place, if we want to improve and if we feel it is important. Eg if I am not in a frame of mind to have a text chat or give a thoughtful response, I will deliberately NOT click on the message, so it remains unread and acts a reminder next time I’m in my messages. Or I will message the person back “hey just saw your message - I’m busy atm so won’t be able to reply properly for a bit but love you!”. OR i will just write back really quickly, and add a note saying “sorry for bad grammar/seeming abrupt - busy but wanted to get back to you quickly!”. I also set a time, eg every Wednesday night, where I take 10 minutes and go through my messages to make sure there’s nothing I’ve missed. 


Despite these strategies I have, I just found a message from someone I really like from two months ago, asking to hang out. But I focus my efforts on my closest friends and family, and ultimately this person is not a close friend.

The arsenal that I use are 1. observing my surroundings and pointing out cool stuff and trying to get other peoples take on it (cool lights, a nice jacket they're wearing, comfortable shoes, a funny shirt that someone else is wearing), 2. asking a lot of questions, 3. just general shenanigans and 4. just know/do stuff so I can relate to others stories and share my own anecdotes. The thing is that I'm goofy guy and I'm always trying to learn so I can easily find some harmless shenanigans to pull or think of questions to ask. What do you like to do?

soc_515445,socialskills,reddit_comment,409,"&gt; OCD? Not overthinking/worrying? I've dated someone who was clinically OCD. I wouldn't say that in particular is a tendency. More of over stressing. I'm pretty analytical so details are a thing for me.

It can have multiple symptoms.  One of them is a voice that says negative things like, ""Kill them."" over and over again, or repeating dreams that are somewhat similar.

OCD is misunderstood.  Psychology tends to take multiple things with overlapping symptoms and then call them one thing.  In this way there isn't a singular OCD, but multiple kinds.  Likewise, for example, there are multiple kinds of depression and anxiety.

Overthinking can be OCD, I think, but it is more a kind of anxiety.  Though, given that OCD is also somewhat a kind of anxiety, it wouldn't be unheard of for one to have anxiety + OCD.

&gt;I understand what you mean. Not an a illusion of perfection. A good sign. Yeah I get that I can't really avoid all causalities. If it's something that turns out bad then it just does.

A proper defence against manipulation is to draw boundaries.  If you preemptively setup mental and physical boundaries of what you're comfortable with, and are okay saying, ""No"" when someone asks for something that crosses those boundaries, you're good.

Manipulators create a perspective to manipulate.  That is, they create a world view, or a way to see the world, that gets the other person to be indifferent, passive, or submissive to them.  Once this is known it can be looked for, but keep in mind everyone has their own views of the world, so if she shares a perspective with you, it's not necessarily a bad thing.  It's if she uses it to try to get you to believe being passive to her then there is a cause for concern.

If you would like more information, I can throw books at you.  Being informed can minimize or nullify anxiety, but at a cost of taking the time to inform yourself.

&gt;I think so too. It's just anxiety from previous relationships.

I've been manipulated before, which is why I know so much about it.  I totally understand.  Based on what you've said, I'm sure you're fine.

Most manipulators out there just want money, so if you're still concerned about it, don't let her move in with you without getting a job first.  If that boundary is too strict or lenient for you is up to you."

When people are shy and reserved they come off as shy and reserved. People give them space or people do not like them. 

When people don’t come to you for advice or don’t open up to you when they need someone it’s a sign that to that person or group of people you are not warm and inviting. 

Being charming and outgoing is great until people start seeing you as someone who is always on and they need someone to turn off with and just listen.

I lost a little of myself (good and bad) being so focused on everything but making myself better."
soc_623486,socialskills,reddit_comment,138,"getting a girlfriend =&gt; being a slave. Why would you want to be around a person who judges you 24/7 and can replace you any time she wants with a phone call? I never understand why reddit sees this as some kind of achievement. I think it's embarrassing that men have so little self-respect and think with their little head rather than their big one. If even Neymar or fucking Brad Pitt has problems keeping their relationships together, why do you think us normies can? lmao make friends all you want, they can be quite useful. But dating is playing Russian roulette with all chambers loaded. And I think a lot of people on this sub want to learn that the hard way. Just my two cents though, it's your life in the end (and your bank account)"

Just reply with “okay that’s cool” and leave it at that. Now whether you want to continue communication with her or not if she texts back is up to you, I don’t really care. But don’t waste your time “taking her down a peg” and “letting her know that she should be overjoyed that she has the opportunity to go out with you” as you say. I don’t know what you think you’ll gain from that but I can tell you that the shit you’re trying to pull will definitely make her lose all respect for you, and will get you on the r/niceguys subreddit of shame.

soc_1607721,socialskills,reddit_comment,183,"I will tell u one thing. You mentioned being a virgin. Sex doesn't solve that issue. If anything I think I felt even more empty after the act. Just dating in general can get you a hug in the first date. I hugged my first date when I met them on my first date. Nothing weird about it. You can hug when you meet and when you part ways. You dont necessarily have to flirt if I am being honest. You just have to get to know them and see if there is a click. Once that click is established or found, you can move on to a second date and again hug and perhaps escalate a bit by putting your arm around the shoulder or something. 

It really depends on the person and how fast youre moving to suggest cuddling. I would say after you feel comfortable with them to suggest, ""hey, im not sure if this is an odd request, feel free to say no, I have been feeling touch starved, I would love to cuddle you, what do you think?"""
soc_242253,socialskills,reddit_comment,349,"I will give you some of the mentality background, which is arguable more important than how.

&gt;people might try to challenge what I've got to say 

People don't do this. The people who do are assholes who slowly end up with no friends anyway, you shouldn't bother with them anyway.

&gt;arrogant

Arrogant means a confident person that I don't like. You can't get people to like you without other people disliking you. If you are a bit younger, you might still be in the high school mentality of trying to get everyone to like you. This is impossible. It is either some people love you and others hate you, *or*, everyone is indifferent. It is up to you to make the choice.

Now on to the how to tell stories:

Start slow, give context, be hyper descriptive, and hyper specific. Humour is about being agreeable. People will laugh when they can picture what is going on. So when you give enough context and specifics, they will laugh.

&gt;How can I practice this sort of thing? 

Tell the same story to each group you meet.

&gt;Do people who tell good stories think it up on the spot or plan it out? 

Not only do they practise, they have told the same story over 1000 times, editing the details to make it more funny. One of my friends is 70 years old (and very professionally successful). She still tells the stories of her first job which happened over 40 years ago. This means she has been telling them for over 40 years. That's why those stories are so good, she has been telling them since before you were born.

&gt;If you can't properly remember what happened should you try to fill it in? 

Make it up, no one cares about fact. For example, I don't know my friends exact age, or when she exactly got that job, so I just filled in the details, notice how you didn't care. No one does either.

&gt;Also should you only tell stories when they're relevant?

Learn how to segue and you will be fine."
soc_589225,socialskills,reddit_comment,708,"As bullet points:

-poor posture (sunken shoulders, collapsed chest). Walk with your chest reasonably up and out, pull your shoulders up/slightly back/down so that they’re nice and square, and walk at a comfortable pace. Look at your surroundings as you go, listen to music and bop your head to it, hum to yourself, etc. These things are always very noticeable to me as markers of confidence.

-compliments are a good way to start a conversation/introduce yourself! (“I like your shirt!” if it’s something from a show you like etc.) This will make you more comfortable with new people. I see less socially adept people avoid these types of interactions for fear of stumbling on words or seeming awkward, but receiving compliments is so nice, no one would care.

-don’t say “sorry” when someone does you a favor, say “thank you”!! This creates a positive, non-guilt related association to the deed they did for you and strengthens your bond.

-Don’t talk about a subject someone is better at than you in a way that focuses on your current inability to do it. This is awkward and makes it hard for the more adept person to respond; instead, ask how they came to do that thing, what interests them about it, their methods for improving, that kind of thing.

-Watch your volume as well, being loud or very high pitched, especially in a repetitive way (even if you think you’re being humorous) is very irritating to the ear. I get bad anxiety when people are loud and disregard others in this sense, especially in tight or public spaces.

-In general, repetition or stubbornness in anything that should have more diversity is a sign of immaturity or lack of social development. Don’t just have the same 3 jokes or bits 24/7 (this is boring and makes you look unfunny), be adventurous in your choice of activities when presented the opportunity, and try new foods. Picky eaters always stand out to me as immature and illogical people because that stubbornness towards something as harmless as food of all things perplexes me. Big social turn off, and I think subliminal things like this add up more than people realize.

-Don’t talk over people or force them to do all the talking! If someone is being curt with you every time you talk to them, and you would like actual meaningful discussion, just ditch them, honestly. Curt and mindless people like that who don’t give a damn about having meaningful relationships won’t treat you the way you could be treated, and it’s a big red flag. If all they say is “good”, “cool”, etc, don’t send them paragraphs about your day and cool stories. Not everyone cares, and that’s 100% their loss.

I can add more if this gets some attention, but these are ways I’ve improved myself over the years :)

Edit: Autocorrect

Edit 2, VERY IMPORTANT TIP: I notice kids who were “edgy” or still kinda are edgelords do this a lot. They’ll make racially/politically/socially insensitive jokes etc, that are insensitive in terms of bad timing (during a normal/serious discussion of opinions and real life things), bad audience (people they don’t know well, people targeted by the “joke” are present), and they’ll keep doing them when no one is laughing or behaving the same way. Making people uncomfortable isn’t funny, things like that do matter in real life because telling “jokes” like that reflect your inability to take life seriously without becoming dismissive of things people want to talk about. I’ve had most of my exes do this to varying degrees—there’s a reason I’m not fond of them anymore. Ultimately, it made me feel like I couldn’t talk about foreign cultural topics and foreign music (kpop and korean genres especially, even though I love them so much), or world events, random thoughts I had, tangents I wanted to explore, etc, because they’d just make a joke immediately that signaled to me that they didn’t want to actually talk like normal people about something. It hurt my feelings and it was a massive sign of their immaturity to everyone around them. 
Being cultured and contemplative is way more fun than being edgy, trust me, I used to be that way to some extent."
soc_1134053,socialskills,reddit_comment,153,"Something I think people miss is that other people’s behavior is not a reflection on your character, it’s a reflection of theirs.

So these people who ‘only want one thing from you’ aren’t giving you the message that you’re unlikeable or undeserving or what have you.

It’s a reflection of where they’re at in their lives. We’re literally in the middle of a pandemic. It’s a little short-sighted to ignore that everyone’s mental health is taking a collective nosedive.

But if you want it to change, that’s going to be up to you. You can’t change other people.

soc_1046232,socialskills,reddit_comment,1056,"If your motivation is to please other people, then it's problematic.

But change isn't inherently a bad thing, you can have negative thoughts you can change that might screw your productivity and mood, you can change bad habits, you can change the way you see people (e.g. judgementally, so that you yourself have less of a fear of being judged).

I'm not writing the following to attack you, but i'll posit some questions to let you examine where your values actually lie, because on the surface it seems like you're avoiding developing your social skills because it's difficult and painful to do so, or because you're overly sensitive to other people's perception of you.

&gt;I avoid non-essential social interactions

Why do social interactions have to be essential? Does everything you do in your life have to be ""essential""? Including hobbies like video games, art, watching tv shows, listening to music, playing with pets? Why not do things just for the fun of it? Why not form friendships with people with minimal expectations of each other so it's effortless to interact with them?

&gt;I don't go above and beyond in any social interaction. Just what is needed, while still being polite and friendly enough. For example, I don't know how to do smalltalk, and I don't care to learn how.

The irony of small talk is that the better you are at it, the less of it you have to do, the faster you'll connect with people and the better quality of conversations you'll have overall. People who can't do small talk find it hard to connect with people, even the ones they actually like. I advise you to reassess your view of small talk, because you're screwing yourself out of lifelong friendships, and you'll have to deal with a lot more inane bullshit from people than if you knew how to navigate to more meaningful topics.

&gt;I have a social battery and it drains at a steady not too fast pace, but being needlessly forced out of my comfort zone drains it MUCH faster and makes me feel mentally and physically tired. Heck, physical labor drains me LESS than a drawn out social situation, haha.

If you're being drained by a social situation, remove yourself from it. It is not an uncommon problem for anybody to be overwhelmed by social interaction, and it's not something special about you. Some people have a higher threshold than others. You are in control of yourself and who you interact with. As soon as you feel drained, go somewhere else. It's a non-issue.

&gt;Basically, 99% of the time socially awkward, quiet, shy, etc. are all things that are said with negative connotations and seen as things in need of fixing. What if I'm fine with how I am?

Who cares about the negative connotations? If you're comfortable with who you are, why care about what others think? The fact is, no one actually cares or thinks if you are socially awkward, quiet or shy, they don't think about you period. This is you projecting this perception and judgement onto other people.
These attributes of being quiet/awkward/shy are most harshly perceived by people who want change themselves, which is why this whole subreddit exists; those attributes in many cases stop people from forming the relationships and experiences they want in life. If you don't care for it, then whatever.

&gt;Why do I have to change to please society? 

Then don't participate in that segment of society, or accept the fact that you'll be at a disadvantage there when it comes to work, relationships, friendships and opportunities. The world and the billions of people on earth aren't going to change things to fit your world view of how you want things to be. That's frankly a selfish and self-centred way to look at it. Besides this, there are so many different microcosms of society, I don't know why you find this an issue. Just find your niche and do what you like. But accept you can't have everything you like, or fit everywhere while being stubbornly the same way.

&gt;Society is the problem, not me

I don't think this is a productive mindset. If you have a problem with Society, which consists of a multitude of people with different viewpoints, needs and backgrounds the common denominator isn't the people you interact with, it's you.

&gt;If I ever become a social butterfly somehow, it should be on my own terms, not just cause people pushed me to! And I wouldn't suddenly be any better(or worse) of a person just because of such a change. 

True.

&gt;I also hate the tone people have taken with me before on the subject of my introversion. For example, my hobbies are all things done at home, and I work online. A relative, in short, said that someday I'll have to go and face the real world and then that'll change my ""reclusive"" nature. So all the time I HAVE spent out in the real world counts for nothing? Same for my online college and work? Why do you have to treat me like some kind of degenerate lesser person because I'm not as social as you?

This is what I suspected. Your rant is more towards your relatives who think they're being helpful, but are going about it incorrectly. As I said, no one out in the world actually gives a shit. It's up to you to make the choice of whether to improve or change things about yourself or not, because it's your life.

&gt;I'm a person who believes in staying true to myself and my principles, even if it puts me at a disadvantage. 

This is good.

To sum this up. I'll reiterate you that I'm not attacking you, just challenging some of your thoughts. I too came from deep introversion and similar thoughts when I was younger. You can be shy/introverted AND socially competent. In fact, for many people it's a big advantage. There's very few reasons not to be good at social skills except that it can be painful and difficult to do so. But that's the only way you'll grow as a person, and the only way your future interactions and relationships with people will improve. If it was easy, it wouldn't be worth it, and none of us would be here."

2. Just be yourself. How did you make new friends as a kid? You found something “shiny” (in common, or a curiosity) and you asked about it.
IE: “whatcha drinking?” “Whatcha reading” but actually mean it. Listen to understand, not reply. 
3. If you get short answers, or it appears the other is not comfortable, walk away. Don’t go any further. Respect the others space. They could be having a bad day. Bad week. Or just not wanna talk to you which brings me to 4
4. They don’t wanna talk to ya? That’s fine. Move on. It’s life. Plenty of other folks that will wanna chatter back.
5. Don’t be self conscious or what you are not. Own yourself. Feel comfortable in your skin. Remember tip 1? You are you. And you are special.

soc_415494,socialskills,reddit_comment,229,"I think in my case I’ve had such an easy time because I approach every conversation and interaction with a sense of comedy and lack of seriousness. My philosophy is that we either laugh or we cry. Try entering your next conversation with an intent to make them laugh or embrace and cherish the rejection because the less serious you are people can ease up to you a bit more. People know the struggle and the limitations of each other after all we are all the same. Conversation in my experience isn’t really about “what you say” it’s really “how you say it”. It may seem counter productive but having a more “joking approach” to everything and having a more relaxed low stakes interaction will get people to take you more serious.  That’s what I found in my case. So in summary you don’t have to take this so seriously. Just be present and be grateful that you have opportunities to have conversations and nothing more. People can generally see the difference of someone who desires desperately for a good conversation and someone who is really just in the moment enjoying them selves without much thinking. Whatever you are doing, whatever you have been through, whoever you are, you are not an outcast. You only become one when u identify yourself as one. I really hope this helps you"
soc_80192,socialskills,reddit_comment,465,"Plan what to say. If you want to confront the person and tell him or her that you don't want to hang out anymore, you should plan what you say carefully. If you have a random outburst or don't choose your words wisely, the person may not think that you're being serious or that you really thought it through. You're going to tell that person that you don't want to hang out with him anymore, so you can think of the best way to explain why.


If the person is just really annoying and you don't have the heart to say it, just say that you're not enjoying the friendship, that the friendship is harmful for you, or that you'd just like to spend some time apart from the person -- permanently.
If there's a more concrete reason, like the person makes you feel bad about yourself, the person always talks about himself and doesn't listen to anyone, or the person is even outright mean to you, then you can tell the person this.
If you don't want to be honest, that's fine too. Tell the person you don't have time for friends, that you're going through a hard time and want to be alone, or that you just want to focus on your studies.

Tell the person that you're ending the friendship. Pick a time and place where you can be relatively alone, and say what you have to say. Stand a bit far away from the person and cross your arms over your chest, showing that you're already retreating. Don't give the person an opening to try to win you over, promise to change, or even try to touch or hug you.


Keep it short. Don't give the person a lot of time to react.
Maintain eye contact. Show the person that you really mean it.

Find the person another friend. If you want to be nice after confronting the person, you can steer the person toward a club, activity, or new location that can help the person make some new friends. This can not only be better for the person, but better for you. But you should only do this if you're feeling a bit sorry for kicking the person out of your life.


If the person finds new friends, he'll forget about you in no time at all.

Follow through. If you've decided to cut off contact with that person for good (after potentially steering him in a new direction), then make the decision final. Don't let the person grovel, randomly show up, or follow you into a coffee shop and force you to have coffee. No means no, no matter what. If the person continues to bug you, you shouldn't sound threatening, but be confident and decisive about your decision."
soc_1099071,socialskills,reddit_comment,413,"Dude if someone cooked for me out of the blue I would be eternally grateful. For real, those details just get me. I do not see why that would make you come across as a pushover to anyone. I know putting effort which is not reciprocated is saddening, so maybe you could change the strategy.

I do not think  you are being weird for expecting them to invite you to have dinner with them. I mean, it would be totally fine if some of them just were close and wanted to have some time alone, but that is totally different from frequently excluding just one person.

I cannot speak for other western countries (social interactions differ a lot from place to place) but let me speak for mine (Spain). I don't think that is a common attitude, unless the excluded person is acting creepy or something like that. I've met some groups of people who could actually carry out something like that without no reason, but I think they just were not nice people, to put it midly. None of the above seems to be your case, so I would just try to ask one of them (whoever you think is easier to approach) if there is any problem between you and them, and what you could do to change that. I'm not saying you should change though, that's something that is up to you and that you should value if it is worth. Try to be tactful, and let him/her know you would like to bond with them if that is what you wish.

I know it may looks like a really direct approach for some cultures, even for other western countries. However, my take on this is that you already tried to be friends in a subtle way and did not work. Since you do not know what the problem is, the next logical step is to figure it out. This way you don't lose your time, and you may bond with them. If not, ok whatever, you tried. If they choose not to tell you anything about why they do not feel comfortable with you (supposing that there is an actual reason) and/or do not invite you into their group, it's on them, not on you.

Please, keep me posted on this. I wanna know how it developes.

I've laughed until I cried, had moments where I came up with a witty comment at exactly the right time, and I get giddy and silly just like everyone else, I'm just not like that all the time, you know?

I don't really know how to change it, so I can't really help you there.

My personal opinion is that this girl may not be the right fit for you. Sure, she's very cute, but if you don't click, what's the use in pursuing anything with her? You should definitely give it time, though. If this was a first date, it's still very early and neither of you know the other very well at this point. Just because you don't have instant chemistry doesn't mean that you should give up. But you also have to accept that just because you're attracted to her doesn't necessarily mean she's going to feel the same about you. That doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you, just that you're maybe not who she's looking for. There are other girls out there besides this one. I think it's a good idea to consider girls who are more like you. A little more on the serious side, not boring, necessarily, just not bubbly and perky. Keep an open mind.

If you are looking socialize and meet people then make a goal along the lines of: By the end of this week, I will introduce myself to one person in my classroom or work that i have not met before. OR By the end of the month, I will take part in ________ social event. Promise yourself that you will try your best. And yes you will have bad weeks but always keep going. Just Keep GOING.

In the end, you will attract more people towards you. It will also boost your self-esteem up. You will feel confident and feel different. Become comfortable in that.

4. Change the way you think. Start to develop a mindset of, ""I don't give a F"". By this i mean just take chances and take risks don't be held back by little things. Think positively and lose that stupid voice inside your head that keeps telling you that you are worthless and no one likes you. Any time you think something bad of yourself in your head. Touch your thumb to your index finger and breathe in and then out. Concentrate on your breathing and think ""I can do it. I will do it"". If mentally you are thinking negative thoughts, your body language will show that to others. If mentally you are thinking positive thoughts, your posture will change and you will have a smile and others will take note.

5. Now that you cleaned yourself up and prepared yourself. Go out there and own it. Join a club (again assuming from your typing and word choice, i'd say you are in college junior. just a guess) or join something where you are around other people. Go to social events even if you don't know anyone there. If you see a fair of some sort on campus just go to it, even if you don't know anyone there. Just put yourself in social environments and you will start becoming more comfortable in that state.

6. Introduce yourself to others. No one, and i mean NO one is going to reject you for introducing yourself. If you are in class and you see someone you want to talk to. Just do it. If you see them in the hallway, go up to them and say, ""Hi we're in ______ together, arent we?"" ""Nice to meet you, I'm ______"". Other person will more likely acknowledge that and be generally happy that someone approached them to talk. Talk about class, general college life, where they are from, why did they pick their major. There are tons of topics you can talk about but you just gotta start somewhere.

7. Don't be scared. No one is after you - no one is going to hate on you for doing something wrong. We're all human, we make mistakes. Sometimes we laugh at those mistakes other times we don't. Don't give up and always try to better yourself. I put myself in social environments, even as i was going to an event my brain was like ""lets just go to _____, its much easier i can just relax."" But i willed up and said, ""no, im going to the event and Im going to meet some new people."" In the end I met so many people and introduced myself and they were generally nice to me too.

8. Listen to others. People love to talk. Everyone wants to talk about themselves. Just listen carefully to them. Maintain good eye contact and just listen to them.

Lastly, No you are not going to master this by tomorrow or even next week. It's going to take time. Start small and be patient but keep at it. Start with little things. Pick up a hobby and see if your college/city has a club or some sort of activity for that. Join it and meet people who also love what you love. 2 Months ago i was honestly at the point of saying, ""What am i doing - X time in university and I have not done anything to show for that. I barely know people here and I'm always by myself doing my HW or watching videos."" Then I read around forums/googling. picked up few things and just went at it. Started to introduce myself to classmates and generally anyone I talked to for more than 5-10 minutes. Started going to more school events. Over the 2 months, I've changed a lot but still i get nervous and forget what i wanted to say. But in generally people are also in the same shoes as you. They just want to socialize and meet people. They aren't looking to hurt anyone or make fun of someone. Meditating - Take 10-20 minutes daily and just relax. Forget about your problems and be in the moment and just relax. Stop thinking, stop doing, stop acting just relax and meditate. It helps you stay calm.
I can probably keep going and writing more and more but I think i got my point across. Now it's up to you, are you going to really change yourself or are you going to come back to reddit with another throw away account by next month saying the same thing again and asking for more ""help"" again. Only you can help yourself and you need to realize that. 
Before you go to sleep tonight - Make a plan for yourself and start following that plan and make a routine slowly.


EDIT: probably tons of spelling mistakes - sorry didn't read over I just wrote all that in one sitting. Hope you can find what you're looking for. PM if you are looking to talk."
soc_1471420,socialskills,reddit_comment,136,"Yeah. I found out from talking to another friend who is similarly brutally honest with me who’s much closer that me and most of our friends don’t expect a simply yes or no. We came to the conclusion after I talked to him about this that if I had received a more productive comment. Like I said she simply said Yes. Whereas a response I wouldn’t have been hurt by as much would’ve been “yes your a shut in, but____” like I mentioned this is more or less a thing my small group of friends all understand to do with each other because we analyze and criticize each other to a degree. But I’m pretty sure she wasn’t aware of this or didn’t think to add more which isn’t really her fault. If that makes sense"
soc_58809,socialskills,reddit_comment,137,"I'm no expert, but in my time I've always found that it depends on the person. I met a girl three years ago who told me the first time I ever spoke to her that she self harmed, and it wasn't weird at all. We're still good friends now. I met a girl the other night who told me about her past drinking problems within an hour of meeting her, and it wasn't awkward or anything, it was just there. I guess just run with the conversation for a while, see how well it's going, and then maybe start opening up more.

Quick edit: I do think it's best to be honest about yourself pretty quickly. The longer it goes, I feel as though that puts more weight on the things you want to open up about."
soc_1577155,socialskills,reddit_comment,342,"I get it. 

I'll share with you one thing I do, maybe it will be helpful for you too.  You can alter it as you see fit. Say you were told you only had 30 days to live. July 12 is your last day, you're moving on to what's next. When you take it seriously, you start to reconsider how you spend each minute. On July 12, reflect on the last 30 days and see how you feel about how you let you ""final"" time be spent. Audit yourself. Rinse, repeat.  

You will find that spending your precious minutes on people who don't appreciate you, who are mean and cruel, and who make your minutes unpleasant ones, is something you begin to not allow.... especially when you realize your time truly is limited. 

Try to remember that what people say and how people treat us has more to do with them than us. Kind people treat others kindly, gentle people treat others gently, miserable people treat others miserably, and so on. You're looking at outward expressions of what's going on inward; in some cases the people themselves aren't even fully aware of their true inward state. When you understand what I've just shared with you tho, you start to ""see"" different.

Hard to make (simple) decisions? I get it. Simply picking what to order at a restaurant is like making life decisions for me. I've just given up and left without eating because I just can't make a decision. Most decisions can be made again in the future, so remembering you can make a difference choice next time is helpful, remembering if you really want to you can change your decision in the moment, and also (I'm going to get real deep real quick here) that were all just spiritual beings have a human experience...it's all just another experience to have, that all. Just ask yourself if that is the experience you actually want to be having, if not, what experience *do* you want to be having. It's kinda just that simple."

In a nutshell though, each colored block with a number represents a day during that week, and you would practice all the bullet points in that block for that day.

They don't have to be in one conversation by any means, just consider them throughout the day and try to work them in to your normal conversations. I would focus on one during a single conversation - and if you start to feel comfortable with that, then feel free to combine some. Have fun with it! But it's all up to you - however you want to use the principles is how you should do it. At the very least you're thinking about them more than you were the day before"
soc_179195,socialskills,reddit_comment,134,"I'm generally happier being by myself than being around other people.  I don't ever feel lonely, and I find talking to people to be stressful.  I spend almost all of my free time in my bedroom.  It's kind of awkward when people ask me about myself because I don't have much to say, but by and large I like my life and don't see a reason to change.

So yes, it may become a strange addiction, but whether you consider the outcome to be ""your demise"" depends on what you want out of life.  If you want relationships, then you're on the wrong track.  You may need some social competencies for other things you want to accomplish in life too.  Only you can answer the question of whether this behavior is good for you."
soc_1809783,socialskills,reddit_comment,206,"I would hazard a guess that your problem is that you maintain your resting face even after you've made eye contact or said hi. If I see a guy across the room with a neutral or slightly down face, I won't think twice about it. If we make eye contact for a second and he doesn't smile, doesn't wave, doesn't nod, doesn't acknowledge me in any way, that says ""leave me alone"". If I say hello and try making small talk, and he doesn't start smiling, now I feel like I'm *intruding*. 

One way you might turn your reputation around and make your coworkers warm up to you would be to go out of your way for pleasantries and small talk. That's actually the real purpose of small talk: to build rapport, trust, and comfort with people you frequently interact with. You don't actually care how their niece's ballet recital went; you're just making each other feel like a team. So when you walk by someone's desk, smile, say hi, and ask how their weekend was. Say ""cool"" and ""wow"" a few times, answer in kind when they ask about your weekend, and then go on your merry way. You'll feel more welcomed in no time."
soc_1124366,socialskills,reddit_comment,186,"Hmm it depends on who you’re speaking to? 
There are some friends of mine I can bombard with texts or speak to without even thinking about it and it’s sometimes due to the fact my mind may be going a mile a minute.

If this is a genuine problem that’s really affecting you in your daily life and seeing a professional would help then you can absolutely do that!

If you want to avoid seeing anyone for this you could try different methods to slow down/not bombard people. The methods could be that you send one big text instead of multiple small ones or you could type out what you want to say and before clicking send you could edit it to have less hyper specific information? 
As for talking that’s definitely a lot more tricky...not sure what methods would work except constantly reminding yourself about it.

Overall I don’t think it’s very concerning! You could ask your friends if they get overwhelmed or annoyed by the way you text/talk and if they do then it’s still up to you whether you want to change anything."

soc_547787,socialskills,reddit_comment,451,"hey!! former F21 worker here. don’t feel left out!! the age group mindset between 18-21 is very similar (22f here) than you realize. in my experience, the best advice i can give is try not force any conversation it only drives customers (in general, not just your age group) away because it makes them feel as if you’re selling something to them (which, i mean, i am, but subtly). it’s better to start small and let it build up if it wants to!! you can start by acknowledging them to store with a welcome and a smile - throw in a compliment if you’re up to it - then leave them alone for a good 5 minutes or so use your judgment. also let them know your name and you’re available for any questions even if they don’t have any.  the more you say this the more it becomes second nature and you can focus on furthering the other part of the conversation. this all lets them know you’re there without being too pushy so when you follow up with them to see if they’re okay, they will most likely open up to you about what they’re actually looking for rather than brush you off with a quick ‘yes i’m fine thanks’ then a minute later they really need help (this happens a lot). i used to be the same way as you until i got placed in the fitting room. when people are trying stuff on, give a compliment! could be about the clothes they selected, their personal style, ask about the special occasion if they have something fancy - mix it up!! you’ll find most customers simply want to talk about themselves which makes it sooo much easier to let them drive the conversation instead. it also helps to know your product as well!! spend an extra 5-10 minutes before or after your shift to just walk around the store to see where everything is which makes you seem more confident and helps the customer too!!

also side note: you’re not gonna connect with everyone - in retail or in life - but it’s not a reflection of who you are or your worth. it could be something the customer is dealing with personally, especially the ones who seem unreasonably rude for no reason (doesn’t happen a lot but does pop up every now and then). if needed, breathe it out in your break room, distract yourself by helping to tidy up the store, whatever works for you, then go to the next customer in a few moments and try again :) sorry this was so long but hope it helps even just a little bit!! don’t give up!!"
soc_1587016,socialskills,reddit_comment,154,"I used to regret saying no. Now it's so far in the past, that I'm indifferent about it. You will definitely regret saying no. That doesn't mean saying yes is the right choice. You might end up regretting saying yes, but you will definitely - and I can assure you this - regret saying no, at least in the short run.

It's just that you will definitely regret a shot you didn't take.

Here's my point of view though. You're 17. You will experience a lot in life and you will go through some tough shit. Nomatter your decision now you might end up without her 5years from now. That's how life works.

I have since then never said no for the sake of friendship. I've had relationships and none have lasted, but I don't regret having said yes anytime. I've dated girls that were horrible looking back, but I never regretted saying yes."

However, an additional thought came into my mind after reading through your comments here.  I could easily be completely wrong; this is just for your consideration.  First, you mention that your decision about the housewarming party was something the other woman could not financially afford, yet was socially pressured to do anyway.  The suspicion comes to my mind that from her perspective, you are the one with social savvy, disrespecting her and putting her down.  If so, it may be worthwhile to sit down with her sometime and clear the air.  More generally, the way you talk about people is very defensive.  I realize this grew from bad experiences, but I do wonder if at this point, you are being needlessly defensive to the point of antagonizing people.  Maybe they start off from not particularly wanting to throw you down the bus, but begin to feel that way because you, as you say, close down, disconnect, and otherwise cut yourself off from people at the least sign.  They may feel they can do nothing right in your eyes anyway, so it's not worth trying."
soc_15906,socialskills,reddit_comment,866,"Find a campus club oriented around something you enjoy.  Show up a tad early, watch for people going into the meeting room.  When you spot a few go in, head on in, walk in, walk up to people while asking, ""Hey is this the ____ club?""  or whatever.   

1) it's relevant
2) it's a completely common thing, throughout the semester, but especially at the start
3) EVERYONE ELSE WILL ALSO BE LOOKING TO MEET PEOPLE
4) you are helping THEM to meet YOU since #3 ^^ , which is nice of you.

Actually, #1-4 really applies throughout the college experience.

Also, go to class.  Chat up the people around you.  If you have trouble speaking with people, just keep in mind that even if the specific person you open a conversation with after/during/before class isn't up for more interaction, there WILL be other people in earshot who are and will be glad to see you reveal yourself as an approachable person.  Expect fair odds that someone will walk up to you after you've shown willingness/interest in talking.  

Good topics in the classroom setting: the assignments, ""has anyone done the reading"", ""is anyone else a _(your department)___ major? "" and ""anyone have _ mynextclass 101 _  later today?"" 

If you get any sort of response, see if folks will linger after class out in the hall and chat, or if people want to check out the student center between classes, or want to go find a shared class ahead of time (since everyone is new to campus, it's not a bad idea).  Just be mindful that even if you have time to keep talking, someone else may need to find their next class immediately.  Don't stress - you'll see all the same faces in that class' next session, right?  Easy.  Just part with a ""hey, it was great meeting you, but I gotta run to next class.  See you next time, ok?""  Easy.  ""Or, hey we should hang out sometime and explore the campus/town, but I have to run right now.  Do you want to meet up after class today and look around? ""

Swap numbers and text them WHEN you are actually heading towards a place at end of day.  Don't text throughout day unless they start it.  Or don't swap numbers, just say, ""hey, I'm going to head into town and explore later, after we get out of class.  Want to tag along?""   EVERYONE wants to learn the town.  But may have other plans.  Just keep in mind its not rejection if people got other stuff to do.  That's the flip side of college - the people you really want to connect with will be the ones who are good at finding things to do and then DOING them.  Get in on that.  Clubs, activities, study groups, and anything that gets you more involved with your academic department is gold.  Especially the latter.  Look at campus jobs relating to your department, or tell your advisor you'd like one.  Great networking opportunities, especially if you work it over the years and can get involved in research - which is very, very feasible for an interested, proactive undergrad.  Just showing interest would set you completely apart from most of your peers.  

Back to the more social part of socializing, the really good stuff is when you start a campus club around an interest of yours.  It's ridiculously easy, and you may need a few people to get it officially recognized, but you can usually recruit before its official by just going to the student life/activities office with a flyer for them to put up.  Put your name and an email (get one specifically for the club so you can ditch it if jerks decide to spam it or whatever) where interested people can inquire about meeting time/place, club focus, etc.  Met a LOT of great people at uni, and I'm a complete introvert.  If you don't get a lot of names but still want to make it official, fill out the paperwork as best you can.  We made my friends ferret club Treasurer, so its not like the people running these offices are terribly strict about membership requirements.  I think we counted the ferret as a non-student member of the local community.  Oh yeah, college clubs can usually have members from the local town/city that aren't students.  Just have to keep them below a certain percentage.  Check with your college about their particular membership rules if it comes up.

The great thing is that everyone is new to the college community, there is a constant influx of new people, meeting and forming connections is one of the main activities, and so going up to folks in class, at clubs, at events, at booths (clubs or organizations will sometimes have booths out in the main square or activities center for events and other stuff) is all totally normal.  Plenty of opportunities where people are basically just there to speak with you if you walk up.   You won't be interrupting or feeling like you're efforts to strike up conversation are socially inappropriate.

The other great thing is that these are friendships you will likely keep for life.   Good luck!"
soc_960666,socialskills,reddit_comment,158,"There's different types of people. Thinkers, connectors, influencers, and doers. These are general terms, and in no way encapsulates every single person on earth. And one can shift towards another category as life progresses, so it's never considered stagnant.

Perhaps you identify more with a thinker right now, who's known to have good intuition and chooses to find all the facts first. But that doesn't mean you can't be an influencer one day, who's known to have fun and thrives when they're talking to people.

Anecdotally, the reason why things change is (using myself as an example) because I used to identify as a connector who tends to promote harmony and teamwork. But I let a bunch of things slip in my life, and no longer focused on the people around me, as I had to look inward and sort some things out. I became a ""get it done"" doer for a long time.

I realize you asked this forever ago, but I think I have a lot of advice you could use.

I was kind of in your position once. I began high school as a kid from a private school so I wasn't part of the majority of established friend groups; I had to start from scratch.
This was especially difficult because I was overweight and had little self awareness.

Now I am 21 and I am arguably the top of my social food chain.

Every piece of advice I give you from here on out is both challenging and more rewarding than you could imagine.

The first, and most important, thing is understanding that you cannot change your friends actions, you can only change yourself. 
You are a platform for a virtually infinite amount of self improvement, and you are starting early so the impact will be greater for you than for any of your friends.

I cannot tell you how quickly these changes will take place, that is entirely up to you."

If you take longer, deeper inhales, you can control your stress and less of those symptoms will appear. I'm not going to tell you to go to a therapist or a doctor because it seems you only get this during stressful situations such as an argument. Try to slow down, don't rush what you are trying to convey, and be more relaxed and get your point across."
soc_69165,socialskills,reddit_comment,183,"It sounds to me as though you are hoping that if you do some of the 'socially required' female things (dressing girly, wearing make-up, waxing your eyebrows), it will give you more confidence and help improve your self-esteem. Those things will then help you make a 'better' impression on people you meet.



Confidence and self-esteem are based on how you judge yourself, which often depends a lot on how you think other people judge you. Right now, it sounds as though your lack of confidence is making you worry about being judged negatively by the people around you. If wearing some make-up and tweezing out a few eyebrow hairs will help you feel like you fit in better, why not try it? It's your choice. If you decide you don't like it or it's too much effort or whatever, you can simply stop doing it... it's not like once you start, you have to do it forever. Your wonderful guy and your friends will understand. They might even want to help you. If it makes you happy, great! If not, that's ok, too."
soc_725393,socialskills,reddit_comment,149,"I guess we need to ask ourselves are we really enthusiastic and interested in what they are saying. Our presence in a conversation revolves around us being comfortable and feel confident with person involved. We often divert our thoughts trying to react to the situation than putting an effort to be an active listener when we are less confident. This works for sometime only and the other person can understand over time that we weren't even listening. 

We should focus on being genuinely interested in listening to others and their problems because usually people speak about themselves more than anything else. If we focus on being an active listener we will naturally be empathetic towards them and don't come across as uncaring. 

And best part is that only when we are genuinely interested in others, they become interested in us.

For example are you more likely to complain to a person about a paper you have to write or about one of your major life problems? Most people will complain about the paper despite deeper issues. This is the type of interaction you are seeing. This is the hidden thoughts I referred to. What percentage of what you think do you say? Most people think just as much and say just as little.

From a statistical standpoint it is more likely than not that you are better off than 50% of people and worse off than 50% or nearby that point.

soc_174697,socialskills,reddit_comment,263,"In any town no one is going to ever really know you. That's up to you to decide your level of influence. Consider getting to know yourself as a priority.

Use your now expansive free time to improve upon yourself in anyway possible(e.g. socially, healthiness, financially, expertise, spiritually, ethically).

Already have hobbies? Expand upon them. If not, time to look for one you'll enjoy or always wanted to do. Locally meet with people or groups that have similar hobbies. 

Out of shape? Get in shape. You might find a workout partner or just meet someone with mutual physical attraction.

Got a habit to break? You can bond and support those with the same struggles. And habit breaking/forming is more effective when not alone.

Enjoy multiplayer? Attempt to transcend the game's flaws to make a habitually positive connection with others beyond the basic experience.

Think you're socially inept? Time to improve charisma. Hit a bar or anywhere in public and see if you can't flourish and pick up. Friend or girlfriend.

Looking to move up in your job? Time to do whatever it takes to get up there(Chances are you'll make some enemies). But people will always want to be friends or are inspired/aspired by ambitious people at the top.

And I agree with focusing on yourself. Can't make friends(easily) when you perceive yourself or others perceive you to be a mess.

soc_779701,socialskills,reddit_comment,261,"Anyone that has more friends than acquaintances is living in a tight social bubble that doesn't get out and meet new people much. Do you really want to be like that?

There's a lot of value in acquaintances.

You can have 10 close friends or you can have 5 close friends and 25 acquaintances. Which would you choose?

Hopefully you see my point, but if you don't, I'll try to explain.

10 close friends comes with a lot of responsibility, there's a lot of things you just have to be there for, not to mention how hard it can be to see them all as much as you'd like, especially if they aren't friends with each other. This gets harder when you all start working or god forbid, you live in different cities or countries.

Acquaintances on the other hand are people that you still invite out and who invite you out and who probably introduce you to their friends, who may become your friends or your future SO.

Don't get me wrong, you need a couple of close friends, but acquaintances are pretty damn good. 

If you need a more self-serving line of reasoning, look into the strength of weak bonds. The short version is that you and your friends know the same people, so they aren't going to open any opportunities up to you that you don't already have access to. Acquantainces on the other hand will have people that they know that you don't and so might be able to connect you with opportunities (friends, lovers, work etc.)"

Just keep in mind that wherever you go in college, everyone is the same as you: trying to meet new friends and have fun. Others are willing to open themselves up to you. You just need to find the ones who suit you the best. 

If you have weak social skills and no real personality, it may be a challenge, but definitely not impossible. My suggestion would be to sit for 10 minutes and brainstorm some things you've enjoy in the past. There has to be something. 

My final piece of advice would be to remember that with the large number of people in college, don't be afraid to take risks socially. When you're with your classmates, you can definitely ask them for help even if you don't need it or just ask them how their day was, even if you don't really care. The point is to get dialogue going between the two of you.

soc_216679,socialskills,reddit_comment,138,"Just to add on here. I'm an older guy now, when I was younger I never was much of a party person. Kept to my own. Similar to you my parents would encourage me to get out and all that but now that I'm older I am still the same guy. I don't have regrets because I spent most of my time at home doing things I was passionate about. I go out with my friends once in a couple months. All I am trying to say is that everyone is different. Some are more social than others. My thoughts on being happy really does not have to do with others, as Dalai Lama said “Looking for happiness outside of yourself is like looking for sunshine in a cave that is facing North.”. Good luck to you man. "
soc_229998,socialskills,reddit_comment,328,"I think you have the right mentality: don't show her that you like her or do anything romantically over the top. Girls fall in love a lot slower than guys do, and you need to give her time to warm up to you.

You're right man, there's never going to be a right time. The best thing to do is take advantage of opportunities that naturally occur to talk to her, and *don't linger*. If anything, be the first to politely leave the conversation. There's nothing creepier than that guy who hangs around a chick and continues to ask her questions when the conversation has obviously died.

Don't add her to Steam, or anything like that; it's beating around the bush (unless she proposes the idea). If you enjoy talking to her then do it face to face, or get her number and ask her out on a date. If you're really nervous about talking to her, there's only one thing you need to do: ask questions! Find out as much as you can about this girl. Right now you're assuming a lot of things in your post, I can tell, start asking her about anything and everything. Being genuinely interested in a person is an attractive trait to have and people really appreciate it. Just be sure it doesn't turn into an interview.

I have to mention that I think you're a little too invested in this girl right now. You hardly know her, and you're already treating her like *the* girl. This is really unhealthy, and it could end badly for you if things don't work out. So please be careful, okay? You should understand that even if things don't work out for you, there's plenty of girls out there who are just as awesome as this one is, and who would be willing to go out with you too. But unless you truly believe this, you won't act as confidently as I know you can.

"
soc_1466894,socialskills,reddit_comment,337,"Hi there - fellow trans man and introvert here.

My first piece of advice is to accept your friendship has ended. This is very important for many reasons, the biggest being: Accepting her words is the most respectful thing you can do. If you have not already, I would type out a short but thoughtful goodbye message for your closure and hers. Something like ""I am sorry I crossed a boundary, and I will continue working on myself. I will always treasure our friendship, but I respect your decision. Take care."" And then you need to make the effort to leave her alone, she might not reply and you need to make peace with that. 

If she wants to rekindle things in the future, she will reach out to you. So you need to give her space, and leave her alone. 

This is also important for you. A chapter is ending, and it is painful. But holding out hope that if you just explain one more time that she'll come around is not good for you. You cannot process and move forward from this pain without accepting what has happened. 

There's other lessons to be learned here, since it sounds like the friendship had gotten rather unhealthy. It sounds like you made some absolutely great steps toward improving yourself and your circumstances, but did not make steps in being less dependent on her friendship specifically.

It sounds like it put a lot of pressure on her to be your emotional support, and perhaps even got a bit possessive. Which is, to me anyway, most likely why in her eyes, not enough has changed. 

So I would say as you begin to process this loss, you'll also want to work on how you treat those you treasure. You cannot pour from an empty cup. You need to take care of yourself so you can be there to pour for them. But you also need to give them time to care for themselves so they can pour for you."
soc_1467113,socialskills,reddit_comment,202,"This used to happen to me a lot, and still does to a smaller extent. One strategy I've employed is to just not think about the social interaction for at least a few hours afterwards. The first few hours, or if dinks were involved then the next day, are the most sensitive times. Do other things to keep your mind off the event. That way your mind doesn't start self destructing and telling yourself that you did this, that and the other thing wrong.

Next, practice mental habits that remind you that you didn't actually do anything wrong. Remember some of the stupid things your friends and acquaintances have done. Do you really care about those things? Have they done anything besides bring you joy by being funny moments? No, of course not. No one actually cares about your gaffes.

 Next, whenever you happen to find yourself spiralling, try to interrupt the automatic negative thoughts. Ask yourself WHY you think you've messed up. When you figure out whatever you think you did wrong, work on making yourself believe that it's no big deal. It'll take time and won't work the first few times but you'll eventually get better at it. Good luck!"
soc_1017111,socialskills,reddit_comment,116,"You’re gonna have to deal with that anxiety. If it has a cause, handle it. If it’s generalized, seek therapy and/or put yourself in the best possible situation to not be anxious (consider cutting out social media, drugs, caffeine, start exercising if you’re not).

As far as frequency of contact, it’s really up to you. If you find that you think you’re too needy, you’ll need to spend more time on yourself and ultimately become good friends with yourself.

There’s also always the chance that two people just aren’t compatible. For example my ex gf wanted to be in contact like allllll the time and I needed more space. That’s why she’s my ex. Good luck!"

Different cultures have different norms with regard to eye contact and such. When I was a teenager I had a friend whose family was from the middle east. It freaked me out how close they would get when they talked to me. I had no idea that this was just a different cultural norm. 

 When you say you feel like you're being ""challenged"", are people actually coming up to you and saying ""hey do you want to fight?"". Or is it just a feeling you're getting based on how they're looking at you? If it is the latter I suspect it's that you're not used to the difference between how Americans and people from your home country interact.  "

soc_703676,socialskills,reddit_comment,189,"Thanks for letting me know that I am not the only one out there when it comes to ""Expensive friends"".

I think it is best to stand strong on your decision to not follow them to the fancy restaurant. Your decision not only impacts this one time, but also future consideration. Peer pressure is quite common when it comes to tight-knit groups. The herd mentality binds everyone in the group so much that violators of the group decision will not go unpunished.

At this point, you may want to pave your own path and start finding others who agree with you. If you can't find anyone, so be it. Always keep in mind that team decision also brings team consequences (at least the poor choices the team makes).

It is easier said than done, but do prepare yourself for future encounters like this. You are going to suffer one way or another, so might as well do it for yourself. So sorry that it's now you against the team. Hopefully your closest ones (parents) got your back on this, instead of telling you to fit in (like mine did)."
soc_1388699,socialskills,reddit_comment,261,"If they are emotionally mature they are not usually manipulative, have their own lives, and tend to not noticeably impact your decision making with their rhetoric/manipulate you... some people are naturally charismatic or just emotionally mature, and they tend to make nicer friends so people like them. I've always been highly liked by others, but I'm not good at being friends. Some people are good at both and still aren't manipulative. I also have met people who are really likeable, really nice, AND manipulative, but where it hits a wall for me is the willingness to have boundaries and keep boundaries that others lay, and not trying to bend other people's expectations. One that was particularly frustrating was kind of an emotional vampire type and she would try to force people to like her and let her in and it was the opposite of charismatic no matter how hard she tried or wanted to be friends. It was a lesson and I hope she has learned but it was not a good time for me! lol.

EDITED TO ADD: I'm reserved with people and don't let them have deeper relationships with me, something I've been working on; I'm not a fan of charismatic folks who use that like an edge or way in and then wreak havoc lol but I do know some very sweet very charismatic people so they can definitely exist without being fake or manipulative!!

People have incentive to be nice and liked if they're manipulative, that's the sad nature of it. but it's definitely not everyone :)"
soc_1134604,socialskills,reddit_comment,266,"Many people have social anxiety and can't ""speak normal to well-adjusted people"" (whatever that means) all through post-secondary and into adulthood. 

It sounds like you're doing better for yourself by quitting the drugs and you're just realizing you don't connect with the same people. This is part of growing up. I can almost guarantee it will happen again and you will need to find your ""new people"" as your life continues. 

Post-secondary school won't be online forever. Group projects will still be a way to meet people. You will eventually have classes in person again. 

You could always join extra curricular programs or activities that you would enjoy which would lead you to other people who enjoy the same things. 

You could get a part time job and meet people your age. We spend a lot of time at our jobs and around the same people, it is very common to foster friendships from a job. 

I'm not going to say ""don't worry about and just put yourself out there"" because as someone with social anxiety myself that is bad advice. 

Slowly take opportunities when you can to do more things socially. It will be hard at first. Acknowledge the voice in your head and figure out why it is being so critical and fearful of meeting new people/making new friends. 

It's important to remember that you're making good decisions for yourself and falling back into old habits is just our way of hiding/avoiding. You sound like you want to do better so I have faith in you, coming from a stranger on the internet :)."
soc_1154408,socialskills,reddit_comment,298,"Okay.  Holding conversations is a very easy but also very difficult thing. The thing that helped me in maintaining conversations was a few things

1.) being genuinely curious
2.) threading questions
3.) willing to say what’s on my mind and ignore my worries or anxieties.

I start conversations by making a comment about what’s going on around us or asking simple questions. I’ll give you an example when I went to get some Panda Express earlier.

Me: how’s your day going?
Her: good and yours?
Me: good now that I got off work
Her: that’s great! Where do you work?

Proceed to tell her a bit about my job. Then say how I get to enjoy this day. Ask her what she would do with this sunshine.

You get the idea. Ask people what they did with their free time, how their weekend went, what their interested in, or just simply state somethings on your mind. 

My conversations always fell flat quickly when I was too afraid to speak my mind. Conversation is not just you asking all the questions and listening. It’s you voicing opinions and pondering things and commenting on related things to the conversation, or not. Your choice.

Also remember some people just suck at conversations. I used to think I was the problem until I realized some people have no substance. Just wait until you get around a true confident and interesting person. Conversation will be easy because they will provide lots of energy and comments and things you can talk about it.

DM me if you wanna talk more. Good luck. Just keep trying to make small talk and ask questions. Looking like a fool is apart of the process. The more uncomfortable you get the more confident and skilled you will get."

Things that will severely damage your connection:
- Interrupt them or give attention to someone else when they are talking to you.

High-school is an especially difficult time because you feel most of these intense emotions for the first time in your life. People saying hs is the best time of our lifes are somewhat right, but it's also the most miserable so it kinda evens out.
I don't know what your friends did to you, so I'm not the one to tell you if you should give them a second chance or not. It's up to you if you are able to forgive them - truly forgive them and not hold a grudge. This being said, you need to learn to see things from their perspective as well, maybe they did not intend to hurt you? Either way, this is your decision and whatever you do, make sure to not keep hate within yourself.

As for the rest of your friends, and the rest of your time in high-school, only keeping to yourself and locking your heart down is the worst thing you can do. You are depriving yourself of a lot of joy. Learn to forgive and move on. You don't want to be a loner, it's not as fun as action movies make it seem.

soc_1836192,socialskills,reddit_comment,233,"The Caste system is one where your social standing or position is based upon your birth and not person merit. The British system is also one based upon your birth that again determines your standing in society. Colonial powers simply recognized the similarities and took advantage of this societal structure and manipulated for their own socioeconomic benefit. 

Today, you find that in each society both are mouthing the “need” too overcome the harmful societal effects of a societal structure where one person is “superior” to all others beneath their “class” simply by birth. At the same time those that were beneficiaries of this system try maintain their socioeconomic benefits gained by their class or caste systems that were created and reestablish these benefits in a changing society. 

You are right on the point that it is something “deeper” at work, but in order for change to come about, you must first be aware of the problem. Too a certain degree capitalism has created a means to level out the system, but it definitely recreates the same system except its no longer one based upon birth but on wealth and economic power. 

What you are witnessing by the author is their attempts to adjust to socioeconomic realities to advance their “standing” to fit in the dominant societies norms and ideals. Its not right, nor wrong, it simply is and is based upon personal choice."

soc_642924,socialskills,reddit_comment,523,"So it's not about saying ""listening words"". Obviously, it's always good to nod along and say yes and uh hums, but if you're truly listening, you won't have to consciously think about saying those kinds of things.

But it's really about responding in a manner that gives them Attention, Approval, and Acceptance. I'll give you some examples:



Steve: Man, Bill yesterday really got on my nerves. 

*So this is an emotional bid. There's a reason he's telling you this. He wants to feel validated. I know it sounds simple but so many times, people will say statements like this and we'll just nod or gloss over it, thinking he's just talking. So give him some attention. Put down what you're doing and give him your undivided attention. Make eye contact, touch the other person physically (in an appropriate way), and put away your phone.

Me: what's up, what happened? 

Steve: He just got wasted last night and I had to take care of him. It just sucks that whenever we go out he decides to get drunk and I have to babysit him all night. I'm really sick of it. 

Me: damn, yeah anybody would be annoyed by that. You don't run a daycare dude, that really sucks that he does that every time. I completely understand how that pisses you off, that'd piss me off too man. I'm sorry that happened.

*This validates his feeling. This let's you know that you were really listening and you accept his emotions. This isn't about being a yes man, you don't need to agree with everything the other person says, but rather showing empathy and sympathy and let them know that you accept how they're feeling. 



Steve will then most of the time go into more detail about how he's feeling because he feels more comfortable opening up because I'm really listening. These kinds of interactions happen everyday but so many of us just gloss over it. If you're present, and pay attention, you'll find a lot of people come talk to you about these things because they feel good and comfortable about opening up to you.


You're right, most People don't want their issues to be solved. They want to feel validated, almost as if they want to be told that it's completely ok to feel the way they're feeling. A lot of time people will like you less if you really try to solve their problems. In the example, I didn't try to solve his problem, I just listened and empathized. 

 If you want to help them solve the problem, you could say something like this after you've let him open up and vent.


Me: do you mind if I give you some advice?

Steve: yeah 

Me: I obviously don't know the whole situation, but it sounds like he just doesn't know what he's doing. Let Bill know that it's a burden on you man, you deserve to enjoy yourself when you guys go out. I'm sure he just doesn't realize what he's doing. 


So yeah, that's a little crash course about being present. Let me know if you have any other questions"
soc_1165348,socialskills,reddit_comment,410,"It depends on the person. 

If someone nice knows you're successful already, offer to help them and stuff like that; their jealousy will be rooted in a fear of failing and feeling inadequate, and isn't necessarily about you specifically. If someone feels they aren't capable of doing something and doesn't want your help, instead of talking about yourself or them, talk about something you have in common with, something that you don't need to compete over, like both loving chinese food or how up to date they are with the latest tv show.

If someone is just horrible, and not just to you, don't bother with them - they're not worth wasting your time on, and are probably just using this as an excuse to bully you, either because they're legitimately jealous and want to tear you down to make themselves feel better, or because the real reason they use you as a scapegoat will make them seem mean and they need to pretend it's about your accomplishments instead.

With everyone else that you know is less accomplished than you, instead of deliberately downplaying things, keep stuff you feel the need to downplay to yourself. It's better to look down to earth by not bragging about your accomplishments than to look insecure or pretentious by trying to ape what you think someone less successful would be like. Only downplay stuff if someone literally says they hate someone like you (e.g. they said they hated someone who voted a particular way with a passion and you voted that way).

And don't downplay anything in public; anyone can be there and many of them will be more successful than you.

Remember that downplaying stuff should NOT be the norm if you do that, you should only downplay stuff as a last resort, and then only if it's believable. If you downplay stuff when people *know* you are successful, you won't necessarily come off as humble, you might just come off as fake and superficial.

As for guys having judged your accomplishments on your looks, don't downplay your looks - challenge them. Mention your thoughts; make it clear that you know what you are talking about. For instance, you don't make it clear that you are a talented chef and not just a pretty chef by trying to make yourself ugly, you do it by cooking everyone a nice meal from scratch and making it clear that it was you who made it."

You can transition from the first kind to the second kind. It won't happen overnight, but it's simpler than you think.

1. Be a cool nice person. Know that you're a cool nice person. Stop giving a shit about how you come across as (don't be oblivious, but underthink instead of overthinking).

2. Learn to spot cool nice people in other groups. The shy/introvert-y people will warm up to you if you get along with their cool nice friends.

soc_1602511,socialskills,reddit_comment,918,"Biologically speaking, having sex, or procreation, is what we are here to do. It's our purpose as a species. So, it is supposed to be the best thing ever. We are genetically coded so that sex feels better than anything else in order to make sure we continually seek it out thus propagating the species. That said, I'll point out that there is definitely good sex &amp; bad sex. Good sex is, without a doubt, the best thing ever. Because it's supposed to, &amp; has to be. Sooo good... Ahem, er, where was I? Bad sex, on the other hand, can be pretty bad, depending on the circumstances. Not to mention the social ramifications. But don't let that scare you. I only say this for perpective. Everybody wants their first time to be special. Like, trail of rose petals leading to a king size bed in a candle-lit bedroom of an otherwise empty house kind of special. But I'll tell you right now, that rarely, I repeat, rarely ever happens for a first time. That's more of a honeymoon thing, I'd say. I hate to tell you, but your first time will most likely be weird, awkward, &amp; will just suck. So yeah, there's definitely no need to rush it. I'm 39 now &amp; lost my virginity at 27. Yes, 27. And yes, at the time, I was getting pretty desperate. But a couple years ago, I told that to someone &amp; they asked me if I would change that if I I could &amp; I didn't hesitate for even a split second to say no. There a certain benefits to waiting until you're wiser &amp; more mature. But at the same time, losing your virginity changes you in some way that I still can't quite put my finger on. I'll just say that sometimes, as a non-virgin, you can just tell if someone is a virgin as if they're wearing a sign. Not with everyone, but if there's a tell, it will scream 'virgin' &amp; you have a 'that explains everything' moment. Not that it's a bad thing. Sometimes, people will respect you for having the willpower &amp; self control to stay celibate. For me, waiting so long gave me all that time to educate myself and be prepared to give a steller performance, if I do say so myself. She agreed, too. Despite it being some dirty ho in her even dirtier apartment... but nevermind that. My point is, there a benefits to waiting, based on my experience. Then again, (and I realize I'm going back and forth, here.) it's not necessarily bad to simply get it out of the way, either. I don't mean jump on the first dick you find, but like I said before, the experience changes you. As in, it is a major life milestone. It's like you gain some kind of wisdom or spiritual growth or something. Idk. It's not like super profound, but it's certainly significant. In a subtle way. More importantly, once it's done you won't have the stress of anticipation anymore. Which can be a huge relief. Now that I think about it, I think the wisdom you gain is that you'll realize... it's just sex. But in a oreos are just cookies kind of way. Still awesome &amp; better than the rest, but it's just another thing you do. Personally, I like double stuf. Hehe... Feel free to ignore that... Also, since you're female, do not let anyone slut-shame you. You should feel free to do whatever &amp; whoever you want, if you're so inclined. If you want to be conservative with your love life, great. But if you end up wanting more, shall we say, adventure, also great. More power to you. That's your call &amp; no one else's. The whole concept of permiscuous women being sluts while men who sleep around get praised for it absolutely ridiculous. Men, as a result, are way sluttier than women, in general. But the fact of the matter is that we are all human and have the same human desires. Women want sex just as much as men. Of course it varies by individual. Some men only want a wife to have kids with &amp; that's that. While others want to put it in anything it will go into all the time. But the same thing can be said for women. Just worded a little differently... I'm just saying that men &amp; women are not all that different. We're not from mars &amp; venus, we're from earth. It's not all that hard to understand each other. They key factor in that being communication. Can't stress that enough. Just like they say communication is key for relationships, it's also the key to good sex. I mean, good communication is key for pretty much every facet of life, but for intamacy, being open about what you want &amp; how you like it, &amp; encouraging your partner to do the same will make all the difference. ANYWAY... I think I should wrap this up before it gets uncomfortable. No pun intended.

Tldr; sex is the best, but can also be bad. It's good to wait, but also good to get it over with &amp; out of the way. Slut-shaming is stupid so have as much or as little as you decide for yourself. And your first time will probably suck &amp; leave you with regrets. But don't worry, it gets better. 😉 (sorry for the book. Hopefully some of it is helpful.)"
soc_277436,socialskills,reddit_comment,209,"I spent a day browsing that sub, and not that I want to be contoversial, but I think it's a bit of a circle jerk of a sub (please pardon the expression). I think a lot the ""science"" is a lot of personal experience and wishful thinking. What I mean by that is it's a sub where a lot of people go to try and fight their addiction to masturbation. It's great for the support everyone gives each other, but I can't see the ""science"" in a very theological based opinion. Anything in excess is a dangerous thing, and addictions can be hard to fight. They can also leave the person feeling like they have no control and very depressed for that reason, so of course fighting the addiction can provide a lot of gratification and quite frankly, with more time and energy to spend elsewhere or on other hobbies, interests, or elsewise. There is no ""science"" to not masturbating, it's just sort of logical to control your habits/desires in a modest and ethical way, and to the average person, the gratifacation of that control just wouldn't be noticable. However, this IS just my opinion, and by no means am I a very smart man. Just a regular dude."
soc_1060079,socialskills,reddit_comment,651,"Lmao! You’ve got me on that first one. They’re dying, it’s too late to work out yall’s issues, honesty in this instance has no value. Tell em you love me n let em die in peace.

Literal life and death stakes aside however...

They’re not dying? Again, even hard truths can be delivered empathetically. You can characterize your struggle to love them as exactly that... a struggle. Something you would want to be able to feel. You can acknowledge their own struggles in addressing the issues with their behavior, etc. If for no one other reason than that it’s far more likely to have a chance of being hear enough for them to make an effort when it’s said that way rather than an accusatory diatribe. If they didn’t ask, you only have to do that second part and only if it’s a relationship you still consider worth trying to salvage. Being honest does not, after all, mean always sharing everything you think and feel solicited or not.

Coming out of the closet is a very personal choice. If you’re not ready, you’re not ready. But if your parents are homophobic not telling them is realistically the kinder/more empathetic act anyway so again... the truth vs empathy choice isn’t actually present. If they didn’t ask but you DO want to come out... again, that news can in fact be delivered with empathy. When I came out as bi to my father for who IK that would be a challenging thing to accept and understand I acknowledged that. I told him that this was who I was, that I would always be available to answer any questions he had even if they were uncomfortable for me, that if it wasn’t something he was ready to talk about I would respect that too. I told him that this was who I was and a part of my life and that I still wanted HIM to also be a part of my life and that, however he needed to show up, there would always be a place in my life for him.

I tend to focus my appreciation for gifts on the thought/consideration put into it. It may or may not be something I’ll actually end up using and, depending on my relationship with them, I may or may not admit that... but that doesn’t mean I’m not touched by it either way.

I’m actually pretty honest about this tho I do try to do so kindly. “Yeah... but it’s cute AF! I can let it out here n here probs n maybe do a cinch here if you want it to be more slimming... but that’s you’re call, mine would be to rock your bodacious ass!” “You’re gorgeous n awesome home girl n yeah, your ass got some extra cushion for the pushin, don’t play like you don’t know that! Ain’t an issue for me n IK it damn sure ain’t for plenty of fools you might wanna holla at but if it is for you... happy to be a workout/diet buddy if that’s important to you!” Etc.

I’d say my belief is a little more complicated largely because I don’t see honesty and empathy as diametrically opposed or even necessarily directly related. For me they are two fairly separate values. 

I believe it’s always best to practice empathy in everything as best Im able... with the caveat that empathy does NOT mean never telling anyone anything they might not want to hear; it means being consistently cognizant of other’s feelings and taking them into consideration. 

And honesty is USUALLY the best policy to me, except for when I believe it would achieve nothing positive and would in fact have purely negative impact... and again with the caveat that honesty does not mean always saying every damn thing on your mind lol; it just means speaking and acting sincerely and authentically w/out deception."
soc_540584,socialskills,reddit_comment,174,"First of all, good for you for facing your fear and saying something even though you were nervous. 

In addition to all of the advice about trying a more natural approach and not asking if she wants to have a conversation; I definitely think part of it is because you took so long to say anything in the first place. Think about it, how awkward would it be for you to sit next to somebody for 20 min in complete silence for them to then suddenly ask you to have a conversation? It’s a lot more natural if when she first sat down you had said something as simple as “hi” or even commented on the weather or something in the environment. The conversation doesn’t even have to go anywhere from there but at least the ice is already broken and if you do end up having a convo, it won’t be as weird because you are already someone she has spoken to. 

Idk just my two cents, keep improving yourself and making progress."

soc_907099,socialskills,reddit_comment,130,"Hey thanks,just trying to help.
They probably are using the group as an accountability  thing.
Seems not nice to ignore the third person completely in it. Although im guessing it's easier in their case to go through the goals with a dedicated partner holding the other  accountable than having to care about the third person too.

This is just my opinion though.they may not be bad people,but accountability is hard and they may just find it easier having each other to go through it.
You dont have to be within their little world.

soc_1791139,socialskills,reddit_comment,328,"I have mind blanks in social situations quite a bit, but I know mine is related to my anxiety (I’ve had severe social anxiety for most of my life at this point). There is a trick I’ve learned during the process of job interviews and things like that, though, that *may* help, if your issue is what you’ll respond to things. Literally, before an expected social interaction, list the things you want to say—like a physical list, either on your phone or some paper, whatever works for you. It can be full sentences if you want, but I just abbreviate and write as basic as possible so my mind can process it quickly and I’ve learned to translate it into more natural speech as I go. The idea is just to use the list as a prompt for conversation, so if you’re struggling for something to say, the thing you wanted to mention is right there in front of you. 

If you think you’ll be asked a certain question, write it down and write a response to it. If you want to ask something, include it in its own section on the list (or wherever you want to put it in the list, I don’t know, people have different methods for making lists, this is just what I do 🤦‍♀️) I even do this for written communication on days when I’m really struggling, but then just keep it handy when you’re in that situation where you have to communicate with someone. I actually saw a French show called *Astrid* about a woman who’s autistic and works with the police and she did something similar to this when she had to call a colleague. She created a conversation tree for how the conversation would go and what she would say and I couldn’t help laughing because I felt her pain, especially when the other person didn’t follow the script Astrid had made and she hung up in a panic."
soc_1168038,socialskills,reddit_comment,255,"I can certainly relate to being socially awkward around past supervisors at work (and most other people as well actually). That worked in my favor for one aspect of the job. I didn’t waste much time talking to people, I just worked instead. 

I went to a psychiatrist when I was younger to get help with my anxiety. He basically gave me two suggestions (after about 10 sessions and $3,000 later haha). 

1. Desensitize yourself to what you’re afraid of by little by little doing more of it. So go talk to people more, in different social settings or whatever you think will help. My brother was similar to me in this regard and went to Toastmasters, an organization that forced him to talk, mingle with professional people and even give toasts/speeches. It seemed to help him.

2. The psychiatrist thought my overall diet/health was not great for my overall emotional state. He encouraged me to eat a more balanced diet, including fresh fruits and vegetables. I didn’t think much of this for a while honestly. But once I actually tried to eat better I felt better (and wasn’t so nervous/ anxious when talking to people).

So just believe in yourself. I know, it is easy to say and think but harder to do. Bosses (of which I am now one to about 8 or so) want people who are working for them to get stuff done. Because it makes our jobs so much easier. 

I hope this helps. 

You can do this! Good luck!"
soc_605897,socialskills,reddit_comment,362,"Depends. Does she want someone will more “experience” or does she want someone who’s “clean” for lack of a better word. The amount of partners doesn’t mean someone is good. Had a friend who had a high number, that’s because the women had them once and weren’t happy with his performance or size and moved on. 

There’s also the thing you hear about virgins, that they get super attached and that can be a lot to take on. There’s the pressure that you don’t want to take their virginity and then the relationship not work out and feel guilty about “taking” it when it was given. 

Sometimes people want someone who already “knows” what they’re doing and the confidence that comes with practice. 

There are people who might also fight it something to take pride in. That can be ok, but it can also have issues because some people are shitty and might do it just to have that under their belt. 

Others will think it was great that you didn’t feel pressured to get it over with and wanted to wait until you were ready. It shows you know what you want and have self control. 

It all depends on how you treat it and how they take this type of information. 

For me, I think it really depends on the person and how they take things, I was with someone who was a Virgin, they had issues keeping it up and sex didn’t actually happen, but they considered that as them no longer being a Virgin, whereas I wouldn’t, and it was a bit off putting to be the person that “took their virginity” when they still have no idea. That might sound harsh but it’s hard to explain. 

So for me, I guess it would only slightly bother me, but that’s because I wouldn’t be able to know what the person was into beforehand and then find out we weren’t compatible and id feel bad about it since they waited so long and saved themselves. Now if the person was just a Virgin because it just never happened, I might feel less worried about it. If that makes sense"
soc_1213980,socialskills,reddit_comment,217,"Conversations, relationships, friendships...all those things are based on give and take, and reciprocity. So if someone starts a conversation with you, and asks you questions (in a social manner), then they would expect you to not only answer the question but eventually to do the same for them. That's how people get to know each other. (Obviously this is different if someone is just asking you a work-related question that they need to know the answer to.)

So, if you go silent, or don't ask any questions in return, the other person takes it as a sign that you either don't like them, or aren't interested in them. Or are very uncomfortable doing what people normally do in that situation. So no matter which of the three it is, they're going to conclude that it isn't going to be useful to continue to engage you.

That results in the ignoring and excluding as you've noted above. It isn't so much weird and toxic as it is a natural outcome from you not taking an interest in them. 

This is an explanation, not a criticism. It's up to you whether you want to connect with people and engage them further, and there's no reason why you have to if you don't want that or aren't comfortable with it."
soc_515242,socialskills,reddit_comment,179,"This situation is obvious.

We cannot often disregard bad comments online simply as ""hate"" since they're more complex than that. Something triggered those people in the lobby to make fun of you.

In this case, shits and giggles. They were not giving you comments because there's something wrong with you.

They were giving you a smacking so that they would feel more powerful knowing they have had an impact on your life. And you let them.

Be as loud as you want, from there nitpick only from people who genuinely care. Carry the same personality to everyone even family.

Example
Initial thought/behaviour: Curse and shout at stuff when something annoying happens

*let's say you've read a book, a Bible, etc. which states to not curse or, be calmer because its better for your body, or it creates a better atmosphere*

You judge whether the learnt idea is good, by asking people, and what you think based on responses from others.

Final behaviour: based on your decision, adapt and test or drop and continue.

That's basics to build a personality. "
soc_1120236,socialskills,reddit_comment,183,"What you choose to do with your body and your life are completely up to you. No one should tell you otherwise. 

However, from your list above, most of the emotions are negative, you're afraid of being vulnerable (some of that is natural) but you also say that it is degrading etc.

It may be that you view sex as completely different, there is a whole spectrum of asexuality, there are demisexuals etc. 

Explore what you feel about it, ultimately it is your decision, but be sure to know what is going on with you. With some self reflection and time you'll hopefully be able to sort it out for yourself. 

Think about what you want in terms of companionship etc. When you meet someone you like and you spend time with them, you might feel comfortable being around them and you may be ok with some level of physical intimacy (holding hands, cuddling), but not other (intercourse). As long as you communicate honestly and clearly to your partner, it is no one else's business what you choose to do or not do."

Try to strike up a convo and if he wants to open a dialog with you he will.  Make sure this isn't you needing to collect friends simply because you are so social and this is your main mode or 'norm'.  

Some people are introverted or simply need their space...they aren't fired up by the company of others like extroverts (which probably seems odd to someone who doesn't live with that mode of thinking.)

Seems like you'd need to take the reverse approach.  Start asking them to lunch, spend time with them, and then you'll become closer if you have stuff in common.

But also, do you actually WANT more friends? Or do you just feel like you ""should"" because you think other people have more friends?  Do whatever feels right to you, but as a fellow introvert, having more than a boyfriend and a few close friends would make me feel like I'm spread way too thin."

soc_1723347,socialskills,reddit_comment,1037,"First of all? 

The idea that being in a relationship means you get to control each other? That is wrong. That is not feasible and is __not a healthy relationship.__

Secondly?

Start learning to accept and love yourself for who you are. That is a huge step towards becoming an adult.

Third?

How do you survive loneliness or isolation?

By surviving in increments. Tell yourself I will get through this hour, day, week by placing one foot in front of the other.

There are so many lonely people out there.

Introduce yourself. Keep busy. Participate in your life. Smile.Try therapy.

__This is what I do when I have a problem.__ You can do this in the privacy of your home - wherever you feel comfortable.

Get out a piece of paper. Draw a line right down the middle of the page.

At the top, place a positive (""+"" sign) and a negative (""-"" sign). It does not matter what side of the paper they are on. Then?

__On the Positive (+) Side?__

Write down everything you need to do to find an answer / help you with your issue (as an example - this process works towards helping you with low self esteem). It could be:

■ Doing volunteer work (helping others is always a good idea).

• Seeing how other people live their everyday lives will enable you to think about __how lucky you are__ to have the things that you have in your life.

• You can even do volunteer work online -  from the __privacy of your home.__ At all hours of the night and day.

■ Write something in a journal every day. No matter what it is. Good, bad, sad or joyful. 

■ Go to the library (or browse the internet) and look up information about self-care.

• You can immediately implement self-care in your life.

• It could be watching something funny on TV, binge watching a favorite series / movie, reading a good book, organizing anything (you know what it is), taking a bubble bath, manicure / pedicure, iced tea and a good puzzle, cleaning, playing a game, donating things you no longer need, writing. etc.

• Anything that __makes you feel good__ could be part of your self care program.

■ Implementing exercise into your daily routine. Do something everyday. Going for walks *is exercise.* Purchase a stationary bicycle or bicycle pedals. Any exercise is good for you, and it __will make you feel better.__

■ Consider therapy so that you can figure out how to build boundaries and concentrate on your life journey. It will help you function better on a day-to-day basis.

■ Concentrating on positive affirmations -  everyday. I write some on sticky notes and place them in places where I'm going to see them.

■ Start reading books. When you read them? Proudly make a list of them. This will open your mind to so many incredible journeys.

■ Set goals. When you achieve them?  Reward yourself.

■ Try a new hobby.

__On the Negative (-) Side?__

Make note of all of the things you do to sabotage your goal (in this instance - improving your self esteem):

■ Not interacting with other people.

■ Staying alone (because you are waiting for someone to phone / text).

■ Using text messaging too much (instead of calls / personal interaction).

■ Gaming all of the time.

■ Cutting yourself down all of the time. Telling yourself that:

• you can never change or be different than you are right now.

• you will never grow as a human being and reach the pinnacle of your dreams.

• you are always going to be ... angry, beleaguered, depressed, ignored, indifferent, isolated, lonely, mad, misunderstood, sad, etc., and nothing will ever change.

• you don't deserve better tomorrows. 

• you are physically unappealing and therefore, not boyfriend or even friend material.

• your forevermores are forever gone __because - you are stuck__ where you are right this second ... forever and always.

■ Not depending on yourself to provide positive input / encouragement in your life.

■ Looking the other way __one too many times__ so that you are not participating in your life.

■ Accessing your smartphone / social media too much.

■ Being resigned to existing on this planet, __instead of thriving.__

■ Not taking chances on something new.

■ Repeating lies to escape your reality.

■ Smoking weed for escapism.

Whatever you think is keeping you from attaining your goal(s) - write it down. All of it. __Even if it seems really silly.__ Use extra paper.

You can do this for *all kinds of issues* you may be experiencing in life. For any topic. Or for __issues you can't seem__ to resolve.

It really __helps you see things clearly.__

I *actually did a chart like this* when I was trying to make a __very important decision__ in my life. When I saw everything written out, I __realized what my answer__ should be. It was quite clear.

It really helped me resolve the issue, and __I knew the decision__ I was making was the correct one.

It __takes time__ when you are on a *journey of self improvement* and / or just trying to figure something out.

*And that's OK.*

You __can take the next step,__ move forward or *stay right where you are.*

The ball is in your court.

Now take the __first steps towards your new life.__ Your new tomorrows.

I have posted __some links__ that you might find interesting.

Your descriptions of the strained and disconnected relationship you have with your own emotions could warrant some kind of counselling. However, I object to the idea that the way you’ve been feeling in regards to dating means something has to be wrong with you, that’s not necessarily the case. You might benefit from looking into things like amatonormativity, asexuality, demisexuality, and aromanticism etc. Reading up on those concepts might be insightful for you. You could just be someone who doesn’t need or want a romantic relationship to be happy and can subsist just fine on platonic/familial connections, that’s a perfectly valid way to live your life. I really don’t think trying to force anything would be good for anyone."
soc_704600,socialskills,reddit_comment,150,Bit of a long shot as it depends on your situation: but My (F31) best friend (F32) is from Sweden and is very much a social person like you - so much so that she took the leap to move away from Sweden at 20 - because she doesn’t get the social culture of her own people. (She actually finds the closed social interaction very boring) She moved to London where people where much more her pace and has now lived in the UK for 12 years and is a citizen. I think it’s fair to say that the social culture where you live might not match your personality. Hopefully you can find like minded people like you online - like the other commenter has mentioned.

soc_275710,socialskills,reddit_comment,169,"I think it depends on the person. Being loyal to who you fundamentally are--and knowing your capabilities and using them with confidence--is a major factor in being a ""big"" personality imo.

The people I know who seem inherently likable with lots of friends usually have some of the following traits: not afraid to put themselves out there, not afraid to take chances with what they say and be silly, use frequent humor, don't have anxiety, good listeners, seem to genuinely care about others, speak loudly (so they are heard by everyone around them), smile sometimes, have a few sayings or go-to statements for socializing with ease, are not afraid to say their opinion but show positivity and tact. Just being positive is very helpful I've found. One trait that seems particularly appealing is people who derive their own happiness/sense of self internally and do not view themselves as superior or inferior to those around them.

Personally I struggle with most of these, but knowing is half the battle sometimes."
soc_1451963,socialskills,reddit_comment,269,"If you don't have social media, the next best way is through acquaintances.   
If your friends are hosting a party, go join. Bring some snacks and meet people there. And join every event, even if the event is cancelled. Chances are, if your friends see that you're interested, they will invite you to more events.   
Ask friends to introduce you. It can be awkward, or it can be somewhat of a joking manner, but ask if your friends ""hey you know any single people that I can meet?"". How you phrase that is up to you.    
If friends can't help, then load up on charisma and hit up any bars, clubs, social settings and try your luck. I don't have that natural charisma, so that's a no for me.     
If you have an interest that is based on teamwork, or meeting people, that is also a good way. But with covid, it might be hard to meet up.    
I don't know if you consider discord social media. To me, it's more of a chatting tool, but some people might consider it social media. Anyways, I've heard of people meeting through discord or through online games.   

Lastly, and I wouldn't go this method, ask family. Now this is when you're super desperate and have exhausted all other options. Sometimes you might have exhausted all other options, but aren't desperate enough. Anyways, I don't like asking family for stuff like this.

soc_1823147,socialskills,reddit_comment,373,"First, to make you aware of it, the way you are using it right now is like it's some dirty sheet and like you are holding it away while touching it only with your thumb and index finger and using your other hand to hold your nose closed.

Learning behind this: Even if it would be, why is this something that would bother you? Would you feel less valued if this were ""gay""? Are homosexuals less worth? Since this is how you get educated from your father, chances are that you probably never thought about it and unconsciously adapt anti-homosexual behaviors. Just wanted to make you aware of it, it's up to you if you want to chance something or not.

So.. saying good morning.. I say ""Love you bro"" to other guys and sending them positive vibes and much appreciation and respect, without being homosexual.

It's totally fine to do so.

First, get aware of your sexuality. Just give yourself the chance to think about it for a moment.

Would kissing a man be something you like? Just allow yourself a minute to imagine the moment you doing it without immediately acting like a child who sees other people kissing the first time.

Then be honest to yourself.

Sexual identy crisis exist because too many people allow other peoples judgement be a main role in their decision making.

I also gave all the possibilities a chance.

Today I know that I prefer women and that anything towards men are not really something that would motivate me.

Knowing this, I can do anything near other men without being uncomfortable because I know about my sexuality. Even sexual jokes are no problem, knowing the reality and not carring what other people think. In the end of the day, I will enjoy my self either alone or with a woman in my bed. Who cares if other people think if I am gay/homosexual.

""Ha! Gayyyyy!""

And if you notice that you actualy men, who cares? It's your life, why other people even bother to talk about other peoples preferation. It's not like you will force them to do anything they don't want to. Who even say that you will like them? Pretty arrogant from them."
soc_700150,socialskills,reddit_comment,412,"nah, i don't think most humans are shitty. like 99 % of people i've met or heard of far have a good reason behind everything that they do. they might not even be aware of it, but that isn't important. people are usually pretty rational (if you take feelings into account as well into this kind of rationality). long story short: people do what they think will result in them feeling better. and i guess walking over to you in a situation where you cry and they have no fckin idea why, it is a hard thing to just walk up to you, ask you what's wrong and try to be a good person. even more so when there are like many people around who can all see that stuff happening or sth like that. and like with close to everything: if it doesn't happen in the first few seconds/minutes, probably noone is going to get the courage to stand up and help you in those kind of situations.

and i think that we shouldn't judge people just solely from that. some may indeed be bad, but some others may even have a bad day themselves. life isn't always just about one person, which is a very hard lesson to learn.

just imagine the following: think yourself that you're sitting at work at your desk, and you see a coworker that you hardly know crying. you maybe think that there are other coworkers around who will help him. or that he has good friends who will be there for him. and by the time you realize that noone helps him, it would be really fcking awkward to be the first person to run over and help him, because like if you want to go there, why didn't you do that earlier.

in the mind of the person sitting there in misery, this time doesn't matter at all, as long as anyone comes and not every just stares at him for the whole duration ... but that isn't in our mind in this situation, because we're too self centered most of the time (imo).

like in all situations where a person needs help in a public environment: it's easy to blame the people not helping, if noone at all helps the person in need. and it's even easier to praise the ones who help him. but noone can actually imagine how hard it can be to stand up and do the right thing."
soc_1273372,socialskills,reddit_comment,252,"Hi! I feel like I relate a lot. I too am pretty quiet in new groups, but I get more open and talkative the better I know someone. 

I don't know if it's correct, but I've heard of extrovert vs. introvert explained to me in a bit of a different way- extrovert/introvertism isn't a measure of how talkative or ""open"" you are, it's a measure of how you relax or regain energy. After a stressful day, do you destress by hanging out and talking with people, or do you destress by doing things by yourself? For me, I definitely can enjoy hanging out with friends, but once my ""battery"" is drained, I need to be by myself to recuperate. I love my friends, but it definitely drains me if I'm around them for long periods of time. Some of my friends are the opposite, and actually regain energy by hanging out or talking with people! If they've had a hard day of work or classes, they want to hang out with friends afterwards to recharge their batteries.  


This makes it easier to understand shy extroverts or outgoing introverts. It just depends on how you like to relax. You can even be a mix of the two, and recharge in both ways depending on the situation! I'm definitely not a psychologist by any means, this is just what helped me understand it the best. Everyone is different though! Whatever makes you most comfortable, labels can't always perfectly capture what makes us ourselves c:"
soc_188108,socialskills,reddit_comment,393,"""and if they do the usual ""I don't have any hobbies"" I burrow deeper and **get them to answer**"" - honestly, I'd avoid you too. you try to interfere too much in strangers' life. why people should open up to you, if you make them feel uncomfortable, asking so many questions? To some, they may be quite personal. I am not gonna tell what I did this summer to someone I do not really know. anwering all the quiestions you ask would seem like a chore or a report.

And maybe you THINK you have a sarcastic/satirical sense of humor while for an outsider you might just have zero sense of humor.

maybe I am wrong about you, your words just strongly remind me of a really desperate to make friends person I know, some people are so ""friendly"" that people automatically avoid them. because, damn, it is college, not middle school, nobody owes you to be friendly with you and to not ignore you.

When I study, I rarely give a fuck about people around, I came to study. I have friends beside uni, so I do not feel an urge to make new ones. I fave few friends in uni too, but nobody forsed friendship on me. When people do, I just wanna run. It is also just my personality, I am used to be a loner, and I do not like to be around people as much as average human being, I suspect.

I suggest, like someone mentioned before, to learn to feel okay being alone. It is truly magical, how much attention you get when you actually do not seek any.

Just my opinion. Because honestly, even if you make friends in college, most of them will drop out of your life after the college, as soon as you delete your facebook or something.  Meeting new people, interaction and socialisation is important aspect of life, but friendships are rarely true, most of them are based on being equally bored in a lunch time, or a company to get drunk with. You'll have more success finding people through activity clubs or omething, that will bond you through an interest, not a place.

Sorry, if it came out mean, I've had fair share of desperate lonely people who think they are just friendly and do not understand why people avoid them."
soc_235978,socialskills,reddit_comment,443,"I don't thinks you did anything wrong, but consider this.

Generally, people like to interact with others who make them feel good. I know from my own experience that same same as you, it's hard to be that guy when struggling with anxiety and depression.

Hopefully you also appreciate your friend's position because it can be draining to have to emotionally support others and painful to see those you care about struggling. A lesser friend might just drift away and not keep trying.

&gt; I could have brought up playing badminton tonight. other than that it will be some of that shitty to-do list, which I'm embarrassed about.

Well then bring up badminton! I get that it's hard to focus on the positive and it's nearly impossible not to bring down others when you're feeling down. Don't take that as criticism. (I know, probably already too late, but stick with me.) That's the double-edge of depression and anxiety. It seeks to isolate you and then feel worse for being alone, thereby increasing the desire for isolation. It sucks. I get it.

That said, it's not your job to be happy for him and it's not his job to fix or coddle you, that said, if you can get to the point that your relationship is mutually enjoyable and uplifting that's the best case scenario.

So a couple tips:

* Yeah, try to focus on the positive in your communications. Not to be inauthentic or cover up other struggles, but if you've got a choice, go toward positive.
* Acknowledge the struggle. ""I'm a little down today, but I've got badminton tonight, which I'm looking forward to and should perk me up."" is a lot more engaging than ""Ummm…meh :/""
* Keep working on your depression/anxiety. It doesn't have to be a life sentence. Therapy, reading, meditation, gratitude... whatever works for you. Keep trying and keep striving to increase your happiness.
* Maybe try practicing some more self-compassion and acceptance.
* It might also be worth exploring whether you've got some anger you're holding on to. We're most likely to judge ourselves harshly when we've been judged harshly in the past. It's only natural to internalize that, but it might not all belong to you. The problem is, as long as you carry it around it can end up intensifying anxiety and depression. This may not be the case for you, but there are some red flags in your language and the way you talk about yourself (which I have historically also needed a lot of work on, so again, no judgement).

Anyway, I hope this all helps and I wish you the best."

For pick-up volleyball it doesn't matter how many people there are, you just divide up kind of evenly. If they want to have ""equal sides"" and you're the extra, then you can offer to rotate in, play the next match, or referee in the meantime.

Also, don't think of these people as other people's friends. You got introduced to them through your connections. So it's totally up to YOU to take it from there! The way to do that is to strike up one-on-one conversations with these people. Greet them by name, with energy, EVERY time you see them! (maybe not all of them, but the ones you click with more) Follow up on previous converations.

Don't think of yourself as the person they don't know that well. Get in there and start connecting! You already have an ""in,"" use it!

Everything can be both a strength and weakness, depending on how we use it. For example, being timid and pensive may make you completely crumble in a confrontation, but might make you a great person to talk to when you need advice. Being confident and headstrong may make you a good leader, but completely unable to function as a member of a large team that needs routinated precision.

Try not to take this personal, perhaps. It can also be hard for some girls to accept this unwanted attention or unwanted feelings towards her. As a girl we sometimes feel we must be cautious with boys who give us this unwanted attention because not only do we not want to lead the wrong person on at times, but sometimes we have “safety” in the back of our heads.

However, one thing to consider is proximity to each other. I have friends...but they live over an hour away. It's incredibly hard to make plans with people who live 50 miles away.

In movies and TV, these friends almost always live together or just live very close to each other. And probably unrealistically close too, because transportation/commutes aren't part of the show.

Also, I've noticed a lot of TV shows or movies will have a trope where friends are forever, but SO's suck and come and go....which is the total opposite of my experience. 

Friends come and go, but my SO has stuck around longer than any friend at this point.

Getting to the point of ""close friends"" from scratch takes a lot of time and effort and it doesn't mean we see each other every weekend. We see each other like once a month or less.

I always have to remind myself that these friendship shows or whatever are just fantasy and nothing more. They are a story that is being shared.

As for your post, my advice would be to stop trying to do whatever you think might help create a bond with the other person, just because you think that is what you are supposed to do. 

A bond gets created over time. For some people you might be willing to do more. To others less. You can have acquaintances which won’t be friends. And so on. 

You are young. I remember being that age and my confidence was not very good. You will get there eventually. Just do things for you, go to the bar alone, enjoy your time, and you will get surrounded by people eventually.

If you're feeling like you're not important to your friends, talk to them about it. That's way better than playing games, which will most likely have a negative outcome for many reasons.

A hello and five open ended questions guarantee a 30 second conversation (assuming you give them time to answer each). How did you like the weather last week? What do you think of Craftsman vs Kobalt vs Sears? How long have you lived here? What car do you prefer working on and why? Least? &lt;-5 examples.

Prove to yourself that you CAN hold a 30 second conversation. If you are worried about it going too long, set a timer on your phone, right before you walk up to them. 30 seconds, you have a perfect reason to leave. Phone call! Or stay, your choice. The important thing is that you have MASTERED 30 seconds.

It’s happened to me a lot where people don’t take me seriously and joke about me because I’ve done all the same things as you. 

My best advice is to sober up a bit. Don’t change yourself, but change the way you behave. I don’t know how old you are, but later on in life behavior like this can have bad consequences for us at work. If you’re in high school, nobody in college wants a jokester in class. Basically, as you grow up, people have less tolerance for BS and want friends who can support them. So what does this mean?

Support your friends. Be there for them when they need you, look them in the eye when you talk. Teach them things when they need help. Give them serious, genuine advice and show that you actually care about them, no matter how they joke about you. Eventually, you will start to become the dominant friend in the group because people will start to look up to you. 

Basically, think before you speak, and ask yourself if the carbon dioxide that comes out from your breath after what you are saying is worth all of those millions of chemical reactions that converted it from oxygen. Those who speak less and listen more are the most wise. "

It will definitely help you realise you're not made of glass, and neither are others. Worse case scenarios and catastrophe thinking almost always only exists in your mind and won't happen in real life, and when it goes wrong it's usually less than 10% of the feared expectation.

But an all out ""FUCK IT. JUST DO IT"" attitude can backfire if you don't have a healthy mental  maturity and acuity to rationalise what your emotions are mentally and physically doing to you.

At one point you said ...""go on discord where it's safe"" - why is it safe on discord? What's the difference between being sober or inebriated in front of your pc talking to friends and/or strangers on discord, as opposed to being around friends/strangers at an event in real life?

One of my biggest obstacles was being able to spend time with friends or family without booze or drugs. The idea of literally sitting in the same room with a bunch of people for several hours watching tv and talking about stuff would make me feel extremely anxious and uncomfortable. Or worse, if I knew I didn't have any booze or drugs and I was going to see others who did, my anxiety would rise.  For years I ignored the why. But once I asked myself why this seems to be such an issue, and used Emotional Awareness techniques to break down what made me feel this way a lot of the anxiety disappeared.

Then I'd put it to a hypothesis by making projections of what would happen if I went to a friends place and drank water, coffee or tea, and saying no to a beer when offered.  It's also important, certainly at the beginning, to put yourself in a place where you can leave anytime you want to mitigate the pressure.

It will take several attempts at doing these open-ended ""experiments"" but if you're as honest as you can with your analysis of what you are experiencing in these moments you'll gain more mental maturity, and it'll be easier to recognise when there is something external affecting you as opposed to your mind trying to defend itself due to social fear.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

It's great you're feeling inspired to be more sociable. Definitely do it! This is half the battle. But without a strong emotional maturity baseline it's hard to shake the anxieties that bubble up since social anxiety is linked to emotions you internalise and create, rather than emotions in you created by those around you.

Learn the concepts of Emotional Intelligence and their toolsets. This will aid you in recognising the symptoms of internalised social anxiety and their effects on you. Do this by doing escalating social experiments where you make predictions of what will happen at an event, and comparing with how it actually went and how others actually reacted to you, instead of how you thought they would react to you."

Youre not into them so you try to softly give then hints but they are persistent because they are coming on too hard and are trying to change your mind.  They are being creepy.  So with this perspective you need to respect the people you are trying to connect with.  You cant force them to like you and even if you could, would you want to be with them then?

I dont know you or how you act.  But id say take the pressure off of looking for a partner.  Work on talking and listening to people.  LISTENING TO PEOPLE!  Your whole motive for talking to people is to date them or hook up, which is also creepy.  Work on social skills.  Genuinely talk to people and listen, ask them questions and show interest.  By showing interest, you will be interesting.  And i really hope this gets through to you.  You should work on talking to people at your future gatherings.  Not for the prospects of finding a mate, but to genuinely get to know someone.  In todays workd everything is quick, you swipe right or left, you skim their profile.  But if you genuinely talk to people and show interest in their life and their hobies, they will open up to you.  If you can carry a conversation and keep them talking by asking questions youll be heading in the right direction.  By you being interested in a deeper level, youll be ahead of everyone else in the dating field because youll make them feel special.

Most of this advice comes from a bachelor party i went on.  One of the groomsmen was a therapist who was married.  He could talk to anyone.  He would go up to tables of girls and be their hours.  Every bar we went to he would disappear and talk to anyone, everyone!  He even said he was interested in talking to people, like he really enjoys it.  But he helped teach a few of us young lads on how to talk to people.  And the truth is people like to talk.  He would even say tell them to tell you about something and then show it in action.  Its silly and easy but seriously.  He would be like ""tell me about that tatoo""  and the girl would tell.  It sounds stupidly easy because it is.  Talk to people about shit they are into,  youll get to know the real them better.  And dont make it all about wanting to fuck them.  Take a few months to genuinely talk to people without alternative motives.  Youll make friends, become more interesting and probabaly find someone you would get along with nicely.

Alcohol wasn’t my drug of choice but it was still a trigger at the beginning. It was a while before I could comfortably hear the words of my drug of choice without having a reaction or feeling triggered but that dissipated over time. I would imagine it would be easier for alcohol because it’s more socially acceptable than other substances but everyone is different. Ask your friend, because from my perspective I’d rather you shared the things you enjoy than making up a story."

Two kids of guys you're dealing with those that are interested in you romantically and those that don't care just hanging out (no new news here). So really it becomes about figuring out who is on what side of the equation as fast as possible. 

You seem ""young"" so advice is going to have varying levels of usefulness. What advice i would give someone in their 30's, 20's, or teens is going to very dramatically. Based on your other comments i am going to assume you're in your teens (if i am wrong i meant not offense). So understand they are JUST as confused about how to relate socially with you.  My earlier advice stands the second it shifts into flirting assert your wishes and your boundaries if they don't honor them discard them and waste no more energy on it.

Also as a teen most ""new"" guys that you meet that come up to you are probably interested in you romantically or interested in getting to know you because they are attracted in someway. Nothing bad here, its just biology. You want to clarify what you want out your relationship with them and if its not in sync move on BUT don't flirt back even if its just playful, we guys are dumb and that confuses the hell out of us."

soc_873038,socialskills,reddit_comment,252,"#Ask culture vs Guess culture || Direct / Indirect

* This is a classic case of Ask Culture meets Guess Culture. In some families, you grow up with the expectation that it's OK to ask for anything at all, but you gotta realize you might get no for an answer. This is Ask Culture.

* In Guess Culture, you avoid putting a request into words unless you're pretty sure the answer will be yes. Guess Culture depends on a tight net of shared expectations. A key skill is putting out delicate feelers. If you do this with enough subtlety, you won't even have to make the request directly; you'll get an offer. Even then, the offer may be genuine or pro forma; it takes yet more skill and delicacy to discern whether you should accept.

If you make other people feel weird and they’re upfront about it then that’s because you gotta either find new people who think like you or curb your personality or you can just be alone. Your choice but don’t make other people uncomfortable.

soc_247186,socialskills,reddit_comment,279,"Think of it statistically, if that helps.


I guarantee, 100%, that the majority of kids in high school right now feel very, very similar to the way you do. Like they don't quite fit in, like they're vulnerable to rejection, like they struggle with the anxiety of approaching others and being the first.


If you can suck it up and be the initiator, most people your age will be *grateful and relieved*, not scornful. Think of it: if someone gregarious walked up to you and said, ""Hey man! My name is Johnny, I'm new here. Mind if I sit? What's the deal with the teachers? Tell me about yourself!"" how would you feel?


You'd probably feel good, right? This person is interested in you. This person saved you from the anxiety of starting a conversation with them. You're going to feel a little generous toward that person, you're going to want to reciprocate. That person saved you from an awkward silence, what a good guy to have around, right? 


Only the problem is that in a group of 5 people, 4 of them - and sometimes all 5 - are too anxious to initiate! Someone has to be that 1 person. If you learn how to be that one person now, in high school, you'll fucking kill it in college. 


There might be some stumbles. But in the end, they don't matter. It's a big world out there, and really, high school matters *so little*. I know it doesn't seem that way now, but it's true.

It's quite understandable that as a straight guy you wouldn't prefer to be mistaken as being gay, but as a girl I can tell you this isn't necessarily bad. Chances are the girls were warming up to you and feeling comfortable, and a number of young women operate under an assumption that they can only really feel comfortable right away with a guy if he's gay. Also, it's a bit of a stereotype I know, but qualities of confidence without arrogance, being fun to be around, liking to dance, etc are often associated with being gay ( though I know that's not really fair.) Basically, it sounds to me like you were doing everything right, &amp; the gay question came up because either the girls had had a bit to drink, felt like being a little sassy and asked just to be silly or because they to were awkward and maybe thought it'd be a funny thing to ask, or they were interested &amp; asked just to make sure they weren't barking up the wrong tree.

There's probably something else going on in her life that's causing her to be moody, and not just the lack of sleep; maybe she doesn't want to talk to you about it because it's something personal.

soc_1704495,socialskills,reddit_comment,531,"You're right, you are projecting quite a bit. 

&gt;- it makes others feel at ease. When you're carrying yourself confidently, it might piss others off (""who does this guy think he is""). Others might test your confidence - women often do that to men

Confident people may make *you* uncomfortable because of your own negative self perception and self comparison to them. They may piss *you* off because of your opinion of the unfairness of it all. But that's not actually how most people feel.

Self confidence is actually what puts a lot of people at ease. That's one of the main reasons that confident people experience more social success. For many reasons. One is simply that when you're with a person who feels secure in themselves, you feel more honored because that person has chosen to be in your company. They're not just with you because they don't think they can do better.

Self confident people are also more generally fun to be around because they're able to engage in the present moment instead of being stuck in their heads. In closer relationships, authentic confidence allows partners or friends to also freely grow, enjoy life, and be themselves because they don't need to be worried about catering to insecurities. 

&gt;- it avoids conflict. When someone is angry at you and you're insecure, you don't fight back and there is no conflict.

Conflict avoidance and not standing up for yourself are not good things. Well adjusted people don't generally want to deal with those who just bottle everything up inside and don't communicate. When we care about someone, we want them to be able to express if they're upset so that we can genuinely work on resolving the problem. I don't trust people who bottle shit up. It usually ends up exploding later on and way worse than it would have been than just communicating like adults to begin with. 

Also, trust me, you don't want to be approved of by people who like you because you avoid conflict and just do what they want. Those are the people that will take advantage of you and hurt you. 

&gt;- it makes others like you. When you're insecure, you do what you think others will like, which gets you accepted. When you're confident, you don't want to change for others, which might mean being alone forever.

That goes against your other claims. Obviously insecure people aren't getting accepted. If they were then you wouldn't be making this post. Confident people are not doomed to be alone forever. In fact, they stand a much better chance of making real, healthy, lasting connections. And they're better able to enjoy life even when they're more isolated, because they can find value in their own company. 

It's obvious that your childhood left a lot of scars on you. I'm sorry for that. Yes, it is very unfair that your parents didn't give you the early love and acceptance that they should have. It is unfair that it's now up to you to learn the self respect that they should have taught you. But it is what it is. I hope you can find what you need."

soc_82204,socialskills,reddit_comment,413,"You don't know anyone? Dude, that sounds great. Especially if you're not going to meet them again afterwards, so it doesn't matter what you say or how you come off. Obviously that doesn't give you permission to be an asshole, it just takes a lot of pressure off of you to set a good impression. 

So your friend isn't going to introduce you to these guys either. Well now's the time to learn how to introduce yourself to others. Some advice would physical, such as be sure to lock eyes and smile before or as you introduce yourself, but all of that should really come natural to you. If nerves interfere with how you're able to socialize then saying things like don't be stiff or look uncomfortable are going to be pretty damn useless, as you'll be feeling that way due to anxiety. Reminding you of how you should behave when your natural reaction is preventing you from doing so is only going to make you feel shitty about yourself. Just attempt to approach people and don't get caught up in the results. You need to remember that this is a learning experience for you, and everyone who starts from step one, like playing the piano, aren't going to be amazing at it from the get go. It's something you're going to have to develop over time, and as you do so, you'll get better at it.

It doesn't matter what you say to people. At all. Let your personality shine through, because that is who you are after all. I'm not going to tell you what to say beyond ""hi, my name's maubog, what's up"". Act on how you feel. You like someone's jacket? Tell them. Congratulations, you've successfully complimented someone. I know that saying ""act on how you feel"" goes contrary to what I said about forcing yourself to talk to people if you feel uncomfortable, but that's completely different. That's a matter of overcoming your nerves. The conversation itself is about tapping into what you want to talk about. 

Finally, don't go into this with the mindset of solely hooking up with someone. That's how you come off as creepy, because you've only got one thing on your mind and it shows. Instead, just try to have fun. Laugh, tell jokes, share stories and enjoy the company of those around you. Though don't stop that from trying to make a move on a girl, just don't think constantly about it. "
soc_209548,socialskills,reddit_comment,386,"I've read a multitude of short inspirational quotes over the years but the one that really helped me the most personally is something I cannot remember where I read or who said it but it's basically: ""It's every man's right to make a fool of himself"".

Just think of that for a second. It's *your* right. Your own personal right. It is, in essence, a personal thing to deal with the rejection of a bad joke. It's really a *personal* experience you're going through. It's out in public, yes, but it's a struggle you yourself are facing and not someone else. It's your personal choice to want to better yourself, like I'm sensing you want to from your post, and it's something you have to talk yourself into, one way or another.

The really hard part is that you have to face an ingrained fear in social anxiety: The fear of rejection. Shyness is basically the fear of being rejected from a social group or based on people possibly not liking you. The fear of isolation and loneliness. This often stems from an overactive imagination that runs through multiple situations of ""what if..."" and ""what could..."" from your own voice talking in a room that echoes back on yourself: Your own mind. It's an *isolated* conversation that doesn't benefit you.
You will only get proper feedback as to what will reject you from a social group or a person or a gathering from hearing of it from the outside. You need to learn from others by watching and reacting and being reacted to. It's something you learn unconciously as a child and we're all learning the nuances of different people as we engage them in conversation. Learning to not be afraid in social gatherings is no different, it's just harder when you've told yourself that you're going to fail.

Who cares if you fuck up a few times from saying something stupid? You **will** get better with practice, but only if you're determined to change.
Think about it every day, with every conversation, and push yourself just a little bit at a time. Throw in that one sentence or say that one thing you were thinking. All the time, do this.

soc_494773,socialskills,reddit_comment,258,"I think people like you need more self confidence and less self awareness. Don’t be so aware of yourself and like try and not make a mistake in speech or wtv. Who cares? We all do em. Just laugh it up. Make it funny. Turn it into a reoccurring joke. For example, an easy fix for the bathroom thing is just make fun of yourself for saying something so ridiculous. It was funny and that’s why they laughed, just laugh at yourself. 

You’re never going to always speak perfect all the time. That’s not a good bar to set for yourself otherwise you end up not talking ever and you might have some good insights on something and you won’t say them because you’re too afraid you might make a mistake. Make em. Do them on purpose. Have a sense of humor and laugh at yourself. It was funny! 

All that being said, it’s not exactly thrilling to hear that people are talking lies behind  your back or thinking you’re something you’re not because of how you are. Bring it up to them. Be confrontational. Or just lose them and if they make a deal about it just tell them straight up why. Not in an angry, but just stating facts.

soc_288000,socialskills,reddit_comment,827,"One things to keep in mind is that everyone thinks about themselves more than anyone else.  We also NEED to feel accepted and love. It's human nature. I'm 35 now, but I was in your exact situation in middle and high school.  I won't pretend to know exactly what you are going through but our experiences are similar. All I can tell you is what worked for me:

1) First off, you are very depressed because you have the world on your shoulders. Your mind is finally awake and you can see the world for what it is...and its kind of a dick.  You deserve friends, and a normal life.  You deserve the love and laughter that everyone seems to enjoy.  

When I was in high school I had no meaningful relationships.  I had thoughts like ""I wonder how many people would come to my funeral"" and ""what the fuck is so broken about me?""  My family ended up moving halfway through my junior year, so I even lost those few people I could talk to. I cried myself to sleep every night for weeks.

I took a nutrition class in that school which was boring as fuck, but there was a single lesson I took away.  That the more you sit around, mope, watch TV and play video games to ""escape"", the worse you'll ultimately feel. Nothing will ever change. I was already pissed at the world, and more so pissed at myself for being such a loser. But I took that anger and applied it to my own situation in the form of exercise.

I didn't do anything initially to fix my social skills. I just started working out little by little. Running to the end of the road and back. 10-20 lb weights in my room, sit-ups etc.  Every time I finished I felt accomplished and a little better. I could feel the wall around me slowly crumbling.

The thing is most of those cats you are wanting to be like are depressed and insecure too.  Sure, they may be better at making friends and/or putting on face, but that just means that you are more honest about it than most.  However this same honesty is also the tremendous weight on your shoulders.  You are letting it consume you and eat you alive.  That's what we have to figure out.

1st suggestion, stop focusing so much on your social life and start working on yourself.  Choose to exercise, even if just for a few minutes a day.  Work to get out of that funk and the confidence will come.  You WILL feel about better every time.

2) Figure out what generally makes people tick.  If you are sitting at the lunch table looking mopey, no one wants to talk to you.  Maybe somewhere out there exists that beautiful kind-hearted woman from the movies that befriends the outcast, but it sounds like she isn't at your school or wherever.  So it's up to you.

The thing is, everyone is interested in themselves more than anything else.  You and me included. So you have to learn to put yourself aside.  Genuinely be interested in other people. Next time you attempt to a conversation, make it all about them and be genuinely curious about them.  Don't even mention yourself.  It's ok if it turns into an awkward silence, it probably will. But it will get better every time.  Social skills are like a muscle.  Those ""popular"" kids are great at it because they are fortunate enough to use that muscle every day.  You...not so much, so you have to plug away.  Look up some videos on charisma and try to follow their advice as best you can.

Along with this I would say be approachable.  That doesn't mean be a smiling buffoon, because people with see right past that.  But if you can learn to genuinely find joy in others and have a healthy curiosity about them, people with flock to you.  It's the core of having charisma.  Everyone wants to feel special, so make them feel special.  

3) Don't take yourself so seriously and learn to laugh at yourself occasionally.  Try to find humor in all those awkward moments and just in general. I can't emphasize this enough.

4) Don't compare your low times to the high times of others.  It's just not fair to do that to yourself.  You aren't alone.  

Sorry for the long post but it's something I know all too well; if I can help anyone else get out of that shitty place then I've got to try. It's a terrible place to be but you'll get out of it because you want to. You aren't the first to be here and you won't be the last. Someday in the future this experience you are going through (and WILL get through) may help you keep a kid from taking their own life.  But just know that you aren't alone.

Best of luck!"

i ask merely on the grounds of understanding and do not perceive people as such.

There are times where we meet people who are unique and the ultimate take away is for anyone, to be mindful and invest in friendships when they come, no one wishes for friends to be up and out and just be ghosted. Some people take this harder than others.

Next time you talk with him, be real. Be genuine. If he is need of sound advice and wishes to get his life in motion, give that in a way you would give it to yourself. 

Parents will blame friends, even if it isn't the friends faults. They can be upset.

It's your obligation to help or talk to him. It is however, your choice to choose whether to reach our to him or not, being as you said you were his only friend. Sometimes a friend misses a friend, not because of the games, but simply because they are sad and miss their friend and are stuck and lost in themselves and need their friend.

soc_935441,socialskills,reddit_comment,423,"That's very good OP. Real respect.

Now tell me how did you realise you do this?

What made you realise this?

What event , action, thought of yourself of others made you to introspect this about yourself then acknowledge you do it and want to change it?

These are the questions that interest me the most.

How a person acknowledges their own toxic behaviour. 

I have met people eho don't acknowledge their own toxic behaviour. Then even if they acknowledge their behaviour they find nothing wrong with it, so they don't want to change it.


You will get lots of advice on how to correct yourself. And the costliest way would be a therapist.

But even a therapist cannot make someone acknowledge their own behaviour untill they accept it.

It's like you can take the horse to the pond but you cannot make it drink water.

Congrats on wanting to change your behaviour. I hope you find suggestions you need.

Some tips I can share is :

1. When someone wrongs you,, hurts you or makes you feel bad they may do it purposefully. So now your turn to take revenge or make then feel bad or whatever. your choice.

2. When someone wrongs you,, hurts you or makes you feel bad they may not do it purposefully.  Simplest example is ""Like you are playing some sports and someone hurts you unintentionally or accidentally"". I know people can hurt you intentionally in sports. But this is the other example. So you should not make the  feel bad. You should understand you also have hurt people physically or verbally without having any intention to do so. Just think about such scenarios where you hurt others and how did they react? Show some empathy.

3. Other may be right and are not hurting you or saying or doing something wrong with/to you. But you didn't listen, or misunderstood something they said etc and you got hurt. Sometimes we get hurt due to communication gap. And you should understand that. Think about the times, you were correct and said things right but others took it other way and felt bad or got offended. But when you explained them they understood same is the case with you.

Of course it's okay to have standards or personal preferences too but what your mother might think of his looks is irrelevant. It's unfortunate you were raised to care so much about attention but majority of that isn't your fault. You're obviously aware of it though so it's never too late to work on that. 


As far as what you should do with this relationship is up to you but If I found someone who's not physically attractive or at least decent looking then I wouldn't have dated them to begin with. It's sorta shallow but at the same time not really cause everyone has their own preferences. I wouldn't date someone solely for their looks if they have a bad personality cus personality matters too. 

I would just break things off with him if that's truly how you feel about his appearance. Especially considering that it bothers you enough to make a post about it. The only downside is that it might ruin the friendship too."

&gt;It's up to you to decide if you just wanna sorta minimize contact with him and see if anything improves on his side if you think things might change for the better, but if you prefer to just cut off contact with him then that's your choice too. It's okay to have different kinds of friendships with different kinds of people, from close friendships to casual ones and ones that are just based on a common shared interest like playing a game together or going to school together. Not all friendships are going to remain the same as people change and sometimes grow distant from each other, so you just have to be honest with yourself about what kind of friendship seems likely with this person based on how things are going (which is not very well atm). And if this friendship is winding down, well, you can always start looking for others to become friends with who won't disregard you like this.

I think that's what I'll do. He contacted me out of the blue a few hours later speaking about something unrelated like nothing happened, to which I didn't reply. I think I'll keep him as a friend but... I don't know if minimize is the right word, but... tune down the amount of contact as long as he keeps this behavior. And if it remains, I'll just stop engaging."

Your best bet is to accelerate its decay and find a way to let off some steam and get rid of it.  Physical activity helps relieve stress so if you can, go for a walk/jog/run/bike ride or hit the gym.  If that's not working, put on some music or something else that calms you down.  I usually crank up some metal because I feel like I can channel my negative emotions into the music and just thrash the stress away.

And with social anxiety a common fear to have which underlies this feeling of being threatened by what is perceived as competition is the fear of rejection. I think deep down we all wish we are liked and appreciated, and when that changes, we start to question what we are good for etc etc. These are not concrete facts, just my opinion."

They may just haven't had the time to search you up or something, maybe they don't realise you want to keep being friends and it wasn't a one time thing.

These are confronting questions that will make most people uncomfortable, especially if you start the conversation this way. Even if they answer you they’re unlikely to be completely honest with you because you’ve made them uncomfortable.

If you want them to open up get them to talk about something they want to talk about first, to put them at ease.

What is everyone's obsession about thinking there's a choice in the matter? Do you think I would be offered a *choice* whether to have my life ruined? People as a species will not interact with me as equals - that means I cannot get a job or advance my career or even know where my next meal is coming from. They did not ask permission first. They *forced* this condition on me, with more power than I can fight back against. You do understand the concept of being overpowered, right? My consent was never an issue. 

&gt; I'd need to move on because what else am I going to do?

I do not have the resources to live my life because other people have them all and they won't give any to me at any price. Do you want me to *steal* them? The fact is, I need people's consent to *exist*, which they will *kill themselves* to refuse if necessary. How can I ""move on"" when the abuse is *still happening*?

&gt; So you can call me horrible and accuse me of victim shaming but is that gonna change anything?

I am hoping that you realize what you've done, what you are a part of, and learn the true nature of humanity. If you refuse to accept reality and remain ignorant of how monstrous people are, then no, nothing's going to change. 

&gt; I really hope that you get better but I mean, it's up to you.

My entire problem is that I am being overpowered - *nothing* is up to me because all of the resources I need to enforce my will has been taken away. I have no money, no business connections, no health; I am demonized wherever I go. How am I supposed to ""get better"" when none of my actions have any effect because people can negate my efforts without a thought?

EDIT: 
&gt; If someone vandalized my car I would EXPECT them to say they don't owe me anything because theyre probably not very nice to me or are very angry at me for something I did. Thats what insurance is for.

That is what the *law* is for. They would have committed a crime for which they should be punished AND you would be legally entitled to compensation in civil court. People do not get to destroy your property just because they feel like it.

Also, how does ""insurance"" translate into sociology?"

Self sufficient or offgrid people (there might be communities seeking self sufficiency nearby)

Conservator

People who live in countryside

These kind of people are not necesserly less modern in their social life. They also might be hard to find or not very open for newcomers.

soc_72819,socialskills,reddit_comment,393,"You are overestimating the amount of work you have to do.  Once you're past the small talk people will naturally open up to you and talk about something *they* care about.  You just have to ask them general questions to keep them going.  Let yourself be used by them to unload whatever they want to say.  Be encouraging, keep them going.  

If you're having problems with segues or continuing the small talk to give you chances to get to a subject that interests you, I suggest lying.  You should actively try to tell a lie in every conversation you have.  At least if it's more than a 30 second conversation.  Make it obvious that you're lying.  Tell a fantastical quick story that never could have happened.  To use an example, if a person asks me how I like my new but low value car (think of something like a Kia) I might tell them ""Well, after I crashed my last 3 Ferraris I realized I needed a car with better handling, and I gotta say this baby performs.""  It's cheeky, they know it's not true, and it entertains people.  People enjoy fiction when they know they're getting it.  If the person you are talking with doesn't pick up quickly that you're lying, just keep making it more and more fantastical.  Now all of a sudden your telling them with a story.

And after it gets so crazy and unbelievable, and everyone had a good time, you can either use silence to your advantage and wait for them to chime in (most people want to keep a conversation going so as not to be awkward and may feel like they owe it to the conversation to chime in after you've been entertaining) or you can just start talking about whatever you want to talk about by just saying, ""And that reminds a lot about ... .""  Nobody cares that that is an untrue segue, or lazy.  You just did a lot of work with your imagination. And lying keeps you using your imagination so you get better at imagining new, non-lazy segues.

However, I recommend using silence.  You get to see a lot about the person by how they respond: If they're receptive or cold, interested or disinterested; how intelligent they are by how quickly they catch on to the fact you are lying.

soc_83735,socialskills,reddit_comment,324,"They never made any kind of a decision about whether or not they wanted to involve you. **Their choice** to have conversations about some person or personal topic **isn't about you**.

**Whether or not you're involved in the conversation is totally your call.** Your decision.


**The biggest mistake people make about being involved in conversations is that they think they need to wait around to be included and invited in (you'll wait forever), or that they need to assert themselves in somehow (it's rude and intrusive).**

Ever seen either of the Star Trek movies or shows - I haven't, really. But I know that when a ship approaches another ship, if they want to talk they ""hail"" each other. They send out a signal, a *beep* that says ""Hey, I want to talk with you."" Then if the other ship wants to talk, they'll open up a channel.

So suppose you're with two friends, and they start talking about someone you don't know - **Stay Tuned** -  that is, do NOT disappear into your phone, do NOT start thinking about something else, do NOT look away at a random spot on the wall.

**Keep the channel open by keeping your attention on the two people**. If they began talking about something personal in your presence, then they probably don't mind if you can hear it. They probably don't care at all whether your listening or not.

**So stay present. Stay with them. Pay attention to what they're saying.** Don't be weird, don't stare, just keep as you've been up until then and let them talk. It's no problem. Then, **the conversation will naturally come back to you.**

If you go into your phone, it won't. You'll be gone to them. You might as well leave.

**Stay tuned, pay attention, and ask any questions you'd like.**

What might be a good idea is to perhaps engage yourself in whatever is going on, even if your not directly participating, even just making eye contact with whomever is speaking. When your listening to someone speak in a group for example thoughts naturally begin to circulate, if your paying attention you can contribute to the topic simply by making comments or asking questions. As long as you don't interrupt anyone directly or something like that you should be fine with just bringing up something relevant. If your in a group setting and the topic is something you are not familiar with just role with it, as I said, asking questions and genuinely making an effort to pay attention might help.

Be yourself, if people don't like that then that's too bad for them but be open to other people and their personalities as well. Look for new activities and things to do, go out and do something you normally wouldn't, get a hobby; you might meet new people.

To me, I know what they're thinking so I immediately explain why I don't drink &amp; then it gets them to open up a bit more to me. I say you should explain your reasons if this ""Oh..."" ever happens again. It wouldn't hurt. What're they gonna do? Stop talking to you? Who cares. If they are human beings they'll hear you out &amp; respect your decision.

You don't need to be in the loop with ""youth culture"" at all. It's useless. Hell im out of the loop because I hate mumble rap &amp; EDM or anything the Kardashians are busy with. People never admit it until its shown, but they can like older music. I always play remixes to 70's music I find on YouTube or electro swing on my phone. Or sometimes old school rap. My favorite is Will Smith tbh lol

Some people who im with ask me what I'm listening to then they seem super surprised in a refreshing kind of way then ask more about the music I find because they didn't even know stuff like that exists on YouTube. Which in my opinion is the best place to find remixes since it's made by any person ever no matter how famous. 

Whenever I tell my friends I don't care for EDM or mumble rap they look at me not like ""oh he doesn't have fun..."" This will sound a bit harsh but I get this vibe like ""oh he has a higher sense of culture than I do so I feel bad for even bringing it up...."" If you show them you don't care about that type of culture but still are proud of yourself, they will envy that &amp; want to earn your respect from what I've seen. 

Yeah among those apps I can see why they're soul sucking. To be fair though, Reddit can achieve the same effect if used long enough lol In my opinion with those apps, I despise twitter because it ruins lives like James Gunn's career because he said some dark stuff a decade  ago &amp; got fired from directing guardians of the galaxy. That shit terrifies me. I avoid it in case I get a super high position in civil engineering which is my major &amp; then I get fired over a tweet I made when I was 15....

Snapchat I used to hate it but I have one because some friends are simply easier to talk to there since they never check their actual text messages. Like I only use it as a messenger service nothing else. It's not too bad plus I get to internally judge what other people are doing with their lives. 

Instagram I'll be honest I sort of like because I only follow accounts I truly respect like ones who do travel nature work professionally or this one artist BossLogic who makes fantastic artwork that is hyper realistic. He even inspired D.CEU to cast Joe M to be Deathstroke because the casting director admitted they chose him after seeing BossLogic's artwork. Also I only post once a year because I go to San Diego Comic Con so I like to believe I am the epitome of quality over quantity. Like I have a picture with Stan Lee that I'm vastly proud of in comparison to that stupid girl who posted about Starbucks 6 days in a row. It feels awesome.  

Anyways I don't think these apps made me a bad person but they widened my perspective although I made complete sure it didn't affect my personality negatively &amp; it hasn't in my opinion. I still feel genuinely the same way about each of them but I know I have more willpower to control myself than the people I believe we are talking about who have their souls sucked out of them constantly worrying. 

Alright sounds good. I'd like to hear how things go for you. In my experience I say always try to smile &amp; don't drop eye contact unless it's for a few quick glances away while you're telling a story or something.

For example: if you're offered something to eat/ drink that you don't like, you're to say "" No thank you, I don't care for any. "" because it could be thought that you just don't want any. When I asked her why I couldn't just say I don't like it, she told me that it just wasn't done. You weren't allowed to do that if you were a person of 'refinement'. ( rolling my eyes and shaking my head)

I've thought about this very subject and I came to the conclusion that my way of thinking was like being visually impaired; my family is like a hearing impaired person who can only understand sign language. When I hear someone near me, I vocalize. I can't see so I don't realize that they are signing to me. They don't realize that I can't see so they keep signing more and I keep vocalizing louder, and so it goes.

For the record: neither way of communicating is 'right' or 'wrong', it's just different. Somehow or another, there has to be a way for both parties to communicate and be heard.And it isn't going to happen if we keep doing what we're doing and taking the attitude that the other person's way of communicating is 'wrong' and that the the one who's 'wrong' needs to learn the 'right' way.

Then I really don’t know what makes dating people who are your equals in total time life experiences has to do with whatever a mature lifestyle is.

Most men I’ve lived around date really young girls because the girls are naive in that they don’t have their level of relationship experience and ability to see these guys red flags. Doesn’t mean that’s universally true, just what I’ve seen with my own eyes.

I’d call my life mature. I own houses, I have investments, I’m at a professional level for employment, I’m a parent, and I take care of myself.

I also routinely go to raves, concerts, festivals, trips, and my most recent fun was hopping out to Hawaii last weekend to go learn to surf and go to a rave because electric daisy carnival isn’t my scene, if there’s no nature or a lot of concrete it’s not really a festival I’m into. Prefer a bit of a natural vibe with the feeing of nature being alive instead of a 100% man made area.

My next big trip is to go to tomorrow land in Belgium in July. With my “mature lifestyle” I can do the things I want in life, and any one I date needs to be close to my level of responsibility. Mature people don’t OD on drugs that aren’t laced because if you are mature you know your limits and are mature enough to indulge sparingly instead of chasing dragons.

If you are mature you can plan your future and save you finances, you can make commitments and. Follow through. Kids not so much lol, there are outliers but it’s not worth hunting them and frankly I find younger people sexually unattractive as well, so there’s a lot im not into.

The only kids that can do what I do are spoiled, or racking up massive amounts of debt. Which is not mature. Mommy and daddy giving you money, or borrowing from your future for a fleeting good time is way immature."
soc_1084230,socialskills,reddit_comment,138,"By nature people and teenagers in particular manifest very gregarious tendencies, so, in complete agreement with the comment above I think they have bonded more in your absence, and instinctively they will try to gatekeep ""outsiders"" from their exclusive and hard-worked circle. This in part is a reflection of their own social insecurities, so they may expect you to prove that you belong. And this entirely up to you since some circles can be very cruel with their acceptance rules, while others only expect more commitment into the relationship from your part aka, be more present.

If you really want it just keep proving in a healthy and not diminishing way to yourself that you want to be with them and with time they will just let you in and you will catch up with new inner jokes."

It was that type of anxiety where my face and hands were starting to go numb. I did a few things to help: 1) practiced my speech a lot, feeling prepared always made me feel better 2) during the speech I pretty much only looked at one of my friends in the crowd and pretended I was just talking to them (this one was unplanned but really helped tbh) 3) I reminded myself that everyone in the crowd, parents and students alike, were there wanting me to succeed, not fail 4) I thought about how good I was going to feel after the speech and that it was only a few minutes of life 5) and finally I reminded myself that I was up there for a reason and that I could handle this. Now I can't say I would recommend alcohol because it seems like it could make things worse if you over do it, but only you know whats right for you at the end of the day.

Hopefully it never has to come to his with the people you know and love, but one day, someone is going to have a really bad day and they are going to come up to you and hope that you ask them how they are doing so that they can have a friend to listen to them.  The moment we stop asking is the moment people will stop feeling comfortable sharing how they feel.  It doesn't happen often, but I'm 30 years old and i can recall 2 times in my life where a casual ""how are you"" turned into a moment that needed to happen for someone else to make it through the day alright."
soc_433782,socialskills,reddit_comment,394,"Here is one way you can solve this problem:

* Promise yourself right now that you will always acknowledge people whom you recognize, as soon as you do.

* Make your acknowledgment formulaic. No thinking. It has to be something simple that requires no thought or conscious decision making: You must smile and nod.

* Step 2 depends on the circumstances: if you both are walking by and you know you are in a hurry or the other person seems to be in a hurry: you wave from afar while walking on by; if the other person approaches you or you both seem to have at least a few seconds to spare: shake hands and say “Hey! Nice to bump into you after all this time. All good with you?”

* That’s it. If you walked past them with a smile and a wave and they acknowledged it: great! If they didn’t: a second later, when they realize what happened, they will be too busy thinking about how they looked silly by not waving to you to think about how you looked silly waving at them. If they walked up to you (or vice versa) and you shook hands: the conversation will happen automatically. If you’re in a hurry or need to disengage or just feel awkward, you bail out at any point by saying you’re short on time and it was nice meeting them.

EDIT: don’t worry about having an awkward past unless something positively horrible happened between you and the other person. In cases like that, it is perfectly okay to ignore them and keep going. Drunk misbehavior is usually not so bad that you need to ignore this person for months after. Perhaps you could have pulled the same routine I outlined above and then if they walked up to you, you could apologize mid conversation. Usually if there’s any awkward tension with someone, it’s gone the moment it’s mentioned, and when appropriate - apologized for. I recently bumped into a girl who acted quite obnoxiously while drunk in my presence (not towards me, she was embarrassing herself at the party). I felt nothing towards her. I hadn’t thought about her between the party and the time I bumped into her,  and once we said Hi to each other and walked on, she was gone from my thoughts just like that."
soc_836325,socialskills,reddit_comment,128,"LOL it’s kinda the opposite for me. I’m personally better with people one on one rather than in a group because I usually hang out with friends one on one instead of a big group. The reason you’re probably uncomfortable talking with people one on one is because you probably don’t know them well enough because you guys are always in a group and don’t have much time to know each friend personally. This can be a great opportunity to get to know the people better and build up your social skills in this type of situation; it’ll be useful in the real world, trust me. This is just my opinion, it may not be the most useful info for you but it’s just something to think about."
soc_1652348,socialskills,reddit_comment,204,"I honestly think that trying to ""earn"" love is always unhealthy. The relationship expert Alan Robarge can explain it. When you want to be better at relationships, emotional intelligence and relationship skills are critical. Social status is important, but might not get you a healthy, loving relationship.

You could make over yourself and get ""that girl"" or the one everyone wants and she could end  up treating you badly. Everyone is messed up. Some more than others. Some people are downright dangerous.

Self acceptance is probably also a must. You don't have to stop being cringey. Sorry if it's a poor choice of word. For me it's a neutral term. Everyone is cringey to others for different reasons and it's hard to be vulnerable in those ways. A lot of people might have no sympathy for your background or issues and you can't force them to be. You have to decide for yourself what you are worth and what your priorities are and work on that so you can be someone you yourself like.

soc_1719048,socialskills,reddit_comment,173,"Do you meet up with them and do they meet eachother?

If you see them as much as everyone else then it's a bit shitty of them not to invite you.

If you don't see them as much is there good reason for that? E.g location,  are they intentionally excluding you? Or have you inadvertently not made the effort to meet outside of the chat groups?

If you haven't seen them in years but they've seen eachother (for good reason) I can understand why you wouldn't be invited, it doesn't mean they don't like you but you don't have that face to face relationship. In that case I'd accept that you are more of an outsider of the group (nothing wrong with that), stay in the group chat and focus on building other friendships elsewhere.

If they intentionally exclude you I'd move on. Up to you if you stay in the group for the fantady football but you'd need to adjust your expectations so you don't get hurt when you see future events."
soc_1618745,socialskills,reddit_comment,159,"Okay, this happens to me a lot. What really matters is that she knows you're sorry. It doesn't matter if she texts you back, as long as you make sure she knows it. And make it a good apology. Most of the time a simple ""sorry"" won't cut it. 

If the argument wasn't too bad, I usually give it a few hours to a day before I talk to her again. When I do talk to her I just talk about literally anything other than the fight. Almost pretend it didn't happen. Then we're fine. 

If the fight was bad and she refuses to talk to me for over a week, I'm not gonna lie, I beg a little. I tell her I'm REALLY sorry and I wish she'd speak to me. She usually admits she was being stubborn then we make up.

soc_187610,socialskills,reddit_comment,448,"&gt; The advice: don't pre-think social interactions, just go in and adapt. 

A military metaphor for what you are saying is that no plan survives first contact with the enemy.  That's only half the truth, though.  I like the old U.S. Army saying that Dwight Eisenhower made famous:  ""Plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.""  Even though unexpected events will render your plans irrelevant, the thought that goes into creating them prepares you to improvise in an intelligent and informed manner.  

&gt; The request: how can I stop doing this?

You think because your thinking brain doesn't trust your instincts.  It tries to take over, but it isn't quick enough, so you stumble.  To fix this, you need to cultivate confidence in your instincts.  Part of it is just reminding yourself that your instincts have served you well in the past.  Another part is to ensure the right division of labor between your rational brain and your instincts.  Think of your rational brain as a corporate manager.  Right now, it's acting like a micromanager:  it doesn't trust your social intuition to do its job, so it attempts to dictate every detail so your social intuition doesn't have any leeway to screw up.  You can try to tell your rational brain to stop doing that, but it doesn't want to stand back and do nothing.  It needs a job to do, and it has a job to do: like a good manager, it should make sure your social intuition has all the support it needs to work effectively.  Then it can get out of the way and trust your intuition to get the job done.  

The support your rational brain can provide is planning.  Your rational brain can survey the situation, review relevant information, and anticipate different scenarios.  Everything your rational brain thinks about will prime your instincts to respond appropriately.  For example, if you're going to talk to people you know a little bit but not well, you might review basic information about them that will affect your choice of banter:   so-and-so has cancer, so don't compliment her on how much weight she has lost; another person's daughter won a school prize, so you should congratulate them; another person is a Trump supporter but has a great sense of humor about politics, so it's safe to joke with him about it.  Those are things that your instincts could theoretically figure out on the fly, but you can ease the burden a little bit by reviewing them ahead of time.  Then you'll have more confidence, and your rational mind will be a little calmer, because it will know that it has done what it can to ensure your success.

I am twice your age and it wasn't ""to late""  for me.  

But it will be hard work.  And it won't be a quick fix.  You have to decide if you are unhappy enough to every action you possibly can to turn your life around.  You will need to improve your diet and start eating healthy.  Essentially nothing from a packet or a box.  

You will need to start getting regular exercise.  You will need some sort of emotional support.  That can be a counsellor or 12 step group or men's group or something where it us a safe place to talk about your feelings.  You weren't born the way you feel in all probability.  Someone,  somewhere along the way damaged you.  Probably not on purpose but passing along damage that was done to them.  You will need to take steps to heal that damage.  

And you need a purpose.  Get involved with something.  Join a group that us actively working to name the world a better place and give them everything you can.  And if they don't come to think you are wonderful within six months, join another group.

soc_900854,socialskills,reddit_comment,337,"There is no decent viewpoint when the disagreements come down to subconscious habits. When a person is accustomed to a universal behavior, and finds an individual against that behavior, they assume a minority of one is a lunatic. But when said lunatic starts insisting on the detriment of the behavior that he is unwilling (or unable) to perform, they begin to think him problematic and degenerative. From there the psyche typically labels him other and bad.

There are a number of universal social actions that I am against. 


Vilifying one’s opposition is not advantageous, only comfortable. 

Respect is a term with overcomplicated definitions because it ultimately boils down to “do not upset authority, even with good cause or you will be punished”. It’s the same as not looking a gorilla in the eyes, just a carryover habit of a world where cooperation was not the norm.

Acting on feeling is dangerous in the long run, and people should take great care to make decisions rationally lest they become irrational. The ultimate conclusion to the majority of arguments I participate in is “Well that’s subjective” or “well that’s just my opinion” or “we’re just going to have to agree to disagree”. This last one is especially frustrating as it fails to even realize the purpose of debate, and shows that the other debater 
A. Thinks the debate is a competition (what other belief could arise besides this and the reality) and 
B. Is abandoning the debate which results in 
C. “Opponent” is stonewalling in order to stalemate a perceived competition.

Shit like this^ is why people don’t think I’m a decent person, even when said individuals are relatively decent themselves, they believe I’m a raving madman that verbally attacks for the smallest things. When actually engaged in discussions of these issues I’m typically told “its not that deep”. Considering the subject matter of psychology and sociology, i think Occam’s razor can be somewhat suspended, and the depth of an argument have less bearing on its validity than usual."

soc_1107834,socialskills,reddit_comment,138,"I have the same trouble to, but my advice would be to start answering like how you would answer in class. 

For example: if a teacher asks me “What’s 1+1?” Then I would easily be able to answer, whereas in zoom for some reason it’s much harder. Think about how you would answer a question in class, and make it a habit to be as much like how you are in class as possible. 

Example for discussions: again, make sure you reflect on how you would answer in class, but you should also try to make a point ASAP. Not speaking up whenever you have a point ASAP is basically the same as procrastination and whenever you procrastinate you make points at the last minute, or not even make a point at all! 

I hope that makes sense!"
soc_739221,socialskills,reddit_comment,889,"I was in the middle of writing a long ass paragraph about myself and how I got through something similar to you, but the best thing I can do is just put what I've found out bluntly. I will give some context though, just real quick here and there.

I've been out of school for a year now (I'm just pursuing my dream, which I'm almost 100% of the time alone in my room and hardly ever talk to people, except for seeing some family whenever mum forces me out the house), throughout high school I dealt with social anxiety, depression and stress a crazy amount and put me close to the edge almost weekly. Everything still hits me hard every now and then and mostly still looms, but after this year I've figured myself and others out and conversing and social interactions.

My outlook might seem a little odd, but most interactions will lead to nothing and the other person most likely won't even remember the conversation ever happening, so most of the time I can overcome my anxiety from drilling that into my head, and it's true to me too. Most conversations I don't remember despite sometimes feeling the awful feelings at the time (anxiety, stress) and remembering them.

This took me a while, I would feel bad for saying no aggressively because people wouldn't take no as an answer. But here's the thing, if it's going to affect you negatively if you do what you want, it's honestly just got to be a fuck them moment exclusively to that moment. Sometimes it would keep me up and I would replay it over and over until I would just need to get up and do something, anything. You won't lose credibility for showing, I guess dominance? It's actually pretty respectable for someone to just stop at a line, and not go an inch over it. It shows strength and will. I find not sticking around after I do something like that works best because that way an argument won't start and it ends there. The next day, it's fine. HOWEVER, this is mostly online. I can say though that this does work in person as I was seeing people from school a couple weeks ago for a few weeks and found myself in a few moments that provoked a boundary moment. I guess just continuing things from where they were before is the best way to continue, or to just leave.

I'm a pretty closed person. I usually won't talk about myself (I've told you more than what most people I speak to on and off know haha) unless someone truly wants to know more about me, which can mean 2 things (to me). Either they want to know more about me to get something out of me, or they're genuinely interested in the person I am. That's up to you to figure out. Listen to what they're saying and doing and you should get your answer.

I do feel lonely sometimes and crave human attention/affection, which I never get (because I don't feel like I should be wasting my time with it when it's a ""crave"" feeling, I'm pretty sure this is weird? So I don't try to fulfill it), and to be honest never really got as a kid either. If I meet new people (usually ""friends of friends"", or better put, people I know who know people) I usually do the bare minimum such as introducing myself and maybe talk to them more if I'm interested in them, or most of the time I let them try talk to me. I talk to them as if they're closer strangers, but not anything more. It should be clear that you aren't close for me but perhaps have the potential to be closer friends. If you talk a bit to someone and decide you want to be better friends, just take a quick dive and ask them for their snapchat or something. Then hit them up later and ask them if they wanna do something. NOT EVERYONE should be your friend.

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest with you, most people are afraid of rejection so they won't take the plunge. Most times you gotta do it. Feelings are only temporary.  Just make it clear that you aren't desperate, so make it sincere. Don't talk to someone because you want a friend, talk to them because they'd make a good friend. I hope this helps. I'm still learning a lot myself. If this is super messy and kinda hard to follow, my bad, I have a really bad habit with posting things when I'm tired. Not sure how old you are, but I'm assuming young, so if it means any more to you, I'm 18 so we might be able to relate there :)

I've missed a lot of stuff I wanted to say because I don't want to type out a full fuckin book, so if you want me to explain or elaborate on something just ask, I don't mind typing something long if you want me to. But also keep in mind that I might be going about these situations wrong and just haven't realised it yet lol. So there's that too. Someone call me out if you see something wrong with what I'm doing haha"

It can come across as arrogant but also interesting if it’s related to the topic of discussion like a short fun fact about a tv show or a movie or something like that. But if it’s idk, a whole history of a country or something like that, then that’s annoying. 

At my college, there’s this one guy who everybody hates because he keeps doing just this. He would go like ‘Where are you from?’ you go ‘Canada, US, Japan, France,…whatever’ and then he starts talking about history or listing historical facts about the country as if I didn’t just learn them in history class. He just comes across as arrogant or show-off who’s trying to show everyone how smart he is. So yeah, it really depends.

Whenever these types of situations happen it’s your choice how you handle them afterwards. Just try treating them kindly and not ignoring them afterwards. That is what makes the situation awkward and shuts down opportunities for further connection. For instance, a few days ago I hugged someone goodbye and it was a really awkward situation. He turned away and I didn’t know what to do and wondered what I did wrong. He then kept being very kind to me the next day signaling me that everything is okay between us and that it was just him not being comfortable with the hug and this allowed me to learn from that encounter how to treat him from now on. Just try to be kind."

First of all, I think communication is best when it is spontaneous, that's why I say he shouldn't think about his words before he expresses them. Of course  he is going to come off as an asshole from time to time in the beginning, and if people call him out for it that's good, because then he is going to learn. Trail and error, my friend - that's how we acquire any skill in this world. It was by no means an advice telling him to fuck the world, always respect anyone till they've proven you otherwise. He can't please everyone in this world though, and if he tries to do that at this stage of his process it is only going to slow him down.

I can tell you 100 percent that the people I'm describing are real, but maybe it could be cultural differences (I'm not american). I was just assuming that these people existed in all western countries. Sorry OP if that is not the case. And yea, I've experienced it, not on myself though. One of my friends all of a sudden changed his personality to being more outgoing, and I witnessed some of my other friends talking about how he had changed for the worse, instead of being happy that his new ways was making HIM happy.

I was raised with the belief that you have to respect yourself before you respect others, in order to live a happy life. Letting someone dictate what your intention is not respecting yourself.

If OP knows his intention is good, it doesn't matter what people think of him at that particular moment, he is going to learn the social norms along the way, but it's trail and error as I said.

Anyways, I wasn't being angry I was just putting myself in OP's place, and if someone calls you an asshole then they're most certainly being a dick, that is in no way contructive critisism.

To OP, I just hope you relate anything I've written to your own situation. Only you know how your life is. Use whatever of it you can, if any, and discard the rest.

soc_379637,socialskills,reddit_comment,271,"While I was at uni, a had a good friend who was a good 6-7 years older than the rest of us. 

He was super friendly and an awesome guy. He would always be there when you got to lectures, in the front row, paying hella attention and taking notes, scoring straight A's while being humble about it. He worked his ass off, but you couldn't tell.
He was so easy to talk to, and for a lot of us younger guys he became somewhat of a father figure or a guy you could talk about real shit with, because he had years of experience and a ton of good advice, always. He had a totally different perspective from friends my own age, which meant he could kind of see through the young adult bullshit the rest of us had going on.

He would rarely go out with us on social occasions but around school he was always ready to chat and joke. He seemed pretty earnestly concerned about a few of us who talked to him a lot, and didn't ever hint that we were too young or he was superior or anything.
He was always listening and encouraging us to go for it, whether 'it' was a girl, a sport, a hobby, a dream.

So I say, just do as you would with friends your age. You don't have to do everything with them, maybe you're not into partying with them and that's ok. Some of them may think you're too old, but more than likely they'll also admire you and look up to you, if you let them."
soc_335858,socialskills,reddit_comment,244,"Personally, I don't feel like it's that big of a deal. If for some reason you put a lot of emphasis on your age to your friends on a constant basis, then I probably would be slightly shocked that you're two years older. However, from my experience, age barely comes up in my college in conversation anyway. There are people I have gone to class with for over a year and recently become decent friends with that I learn are a few years older to me and I barely bat an eye. If you were my close friend and confided this lie to me I would just be like ""Ok.... so??"" You had your own personal reason to take off for school and I would actually respect you for being able to make that decision. I know not everyone would have the same reaction, but I don't think 2 years is enough of a lie to have close friends totally distrusting you. 

I can't really say how you should reveal to them that you lied about your age. The birthday surprise seems like it could either work well or become really awkward, it just depends on how outgoing and drunk your friends are. It may be safer to confide in them privately, but like I said I don't think in the end it will be that big of a deal if they're truly your friends. Just my opinion though, take it as you may"

Not that bad, right? All he really said was that he wouldn't be comfortable getting physical with somebody that was trying to hit on him when he wasn't interested. This is sorta the same response that *anybody* would give about either gender.

Coming out to him will obviously have to change your relationship to some extent, but it is hard to say how much. Up to you if you want to risk it and find out. Your relationship will likely not be exactly the same as it was previously, but not necessarily in a strictly positive or negative way either.

Consider also that your decision affects him and not only yourself. You aren't coming out publicly, you are instead asking him to keep your secret for you and asking him to share your burden. So it won't be easy for him either.

Ultimately you will need to eventually decide when you intend to tell him. Maybe it requires more scouting and gradually working it in before you are fully comfortable. Maybe you just need to go for it. Or maybe he already knows anyway haha"

He started taking drugs and conversations were not the same again. Hanging out with him was difficult, close friends of ours were distancing from him because he was and still is a junkie. I tried to talk some sense into him for years now and nothing changed. He got worse and worse and at one point I got fed up with it and told him we are done. I got better things to do than drink a beer with you and talk the same stuff for years.

soc_653410,socialskills,reddit_comment,234,"&gt; I kind of consciously stay very critique about myself because I think it's a good way to push me and make me get better


There is a BIG difference between constructive self-criticism and negative thinking. For example:


""I said something rude, I am such a jerk!""


""I said something rude, which hurt Jane. I'm going to be careful not to do that again."" 


See the difference? This is another aspect of mindfulness in speech. If you're comfortable saying hurtful or offensive or rude things about *yourself*, it's going to be hard to stop saying hurtful or offensive or rude things about others too. 


It might seem silly, but one thing that can help you in choosing your words carefully is something called [close reading](https://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/how-do-close-reading). It means delving very deeply into the details of a text (this can be a novel, a comic book, a blog post - anything) and really trying to understand how language works and what it conveys.


You might ask yourself why an author chose *this* particular word over *that* particular word, for example. There is no right or wrong answer! It just gets you thinking about the way we use language to convey meaning.


That's why the whole honesty thing is such a problem. Honesty is only one, *small* part of conveying meaning to others. You need to start considering and understanding all the other parts of communication too."

I think you are gonna just have to grow up and realise your actions have consequences. You might well have lost your chance with person B now, and there's very little you can do to change that; it's all dependent on how she feels. 

Also, you have to be honest with yourself first and foremost: why did you sleep with your ex if you are looking to be with person B? Once you know the answer to that, you should probably talk it through with person B, be as honest as you can, and just hope that she will still want to have anything to do with you.

soc_1723753,socialskills,reddit_comment,360,"1. NONE OF THEIR ACTIONS ARE YOUR FAULT. There are things adults do and there are things children do. A child pushes boundries, an adult asks questions when they need to understand things. In my opinion there are FAR too many ""men"" out there that are full grown children. I, for one, am over it.

2. As for your ""friends"" that have crossed those boundries, it's obvious that they don't understand them clearly enough or dont fucking care. Your choice there is to either have a sober discussion about what needs to be changed on their end or if it's time to cut them out of your life. It might seem harsh, and maybe a conversation about what was said and done when there was alcohol needs to happen,  but its necessary. Sometimes things are said under the influence and it didn't come out right or it was over stated and so on. 

3. As for apps and online dating I'd add a line about I will not discuss x,y,z topic. If they push that envelope, they ain't worth your time. 

4. I am not non binary but what I'm going to relate it to is being in the bdsm community. Not that they are similar in anyway, but maybe this perspective will help... when some one asks about my bdsm experience I am willing to answer any RESPECTABLE questions. You are NEVER obligated to answer any question. Which is frankly another test on being an adult. Anyway, I do that because I know people are curious and I treat it as an opportunity to teach someone in a healthy manner. So maybe the next time they hear some one talk bad about my community or some one like me they can hopefully relate it to a good experience, where they learned about a human being and say something in defense. That's my hope, I have no clue if that's how it is.

With your example, I think it's better, you're basing your decision off of reviews, not your personal taste so you're not really the picker, you as a group are making an objective decision. If you don't feel like that's the case, frame it as an objective decision. Instead of saying ""I really like the look of this restaurant"" Say ""look at the reviews for this restaurant?

""You ALWAYS do general XYZ"" is different than ""When you did XYZ this morning, I felt...""

Create some healthy boundaries, call people on bad behavior and let them know what you'll do if it continues. Try not to threaten the relationship itself, you can say something like if you're not there at 8 I'm going to have to leave without you because I don't want to be late to the chronically late person and leave if they aren't there. Maybe not slam the door in their face if they are running up to you at 801 but you get the point. Try fixing the relationship, then if they continue you can reduce contact knowing you tried. I rarely slam the door on relationships anymore, reducing contact is an easy way to move on without burning bridges."

If you want to have more ideas on this subject, I recommend Nan Lin's book Social Capital. At the end of the day, it's up to you whether you agree with it or not, and I'll listen to your criticisms with pleasure, but even saying ""you need therapy"" to someone who offers an opinion you don't agree with is Social Capital itself.

I'm 31/f, have a few friends, but have gotten to the point where I don't want to socialize because it's so much work and there is a lingering feeling of rejection. My parents moved quite a bit, and the hardest move was leaving a group of loving, genuine friends in middle school to another group that never fully accepted me and pointed out my faults (or so it felt).

One thing that is helping is a book called ""Feeling Good"" by David Burns. It talks about the cognitive distortions that cause you to think and feel these ways. And there is nothing wrong with you, and to realize that you may be creating the responses through your own self fulfilling prophecy could be very true (and very insightful). I think if we can approach these situations by looking at what's in front of us-a loving boyfriend, family, even strangers who react well-we could see more clearly how it is a made up thought and not real. I mean, even for the most unattractive or most awkward person, they are or can be loved. I'm guessing you are neither of these things, so it's really up to you how you perceive others reactions and how you want to be.

The issue here is that you are relying on this invitation to measure your own self worth. It's normal to feel down about this, but it's up to you to rationalize in your mind or, in other words, come to terms with the fact that it doesn't reflect on who you are.

soc_1728456,socialskills,reddit_comment,249,"Best advice my friend is to have positive affirmations; a positive mindset is key. Don’t see yourself as a person with life long depression because you’re defeating yourself. You are who you choose to be so choose to have a mindset of being an amazing person and you will naturally see yourself as such. 

Best ways to interact with people is to just be natural; again don’t stress thinking how you can’t talk to people. You ARE an amazing person to get to know. Try and just be friendly; be that person who says hi and has a smile; you will naturally gravitate people towards you since normal people like to be around good company. Try and throw in some humor to lighten moments up. 

Not everyone will like your positive attitude but that’s ok since some people are just mean or have personal issues themselves unfortunately. As a matter of fact be that person who uplifts others. When people open up to you about their issues you can share and show your understanding based on issues you’ve had with feeling the way you are at this moment in time.

All around understand how amazing you actually are because we all have the potential to be that; we just have to realize and express it :D do not let negative thoughts get to you; do not let them win because you’re stronger than that my friend!

I work at a Japanese restaurant run by Chinese people and most of the employees are Thai. I am the only American who works there, or who has English as their first language. It’s been such a challenge connecting with them but after almost a year I’ve learned how to jump the barriers of language and culture and we’re like family now. One of the hardest things to learn is just to simply listen to someone, not just hear them. I find it helps if you actively think not about what you’re going to reply to what they say as they’re saying it, but truly soak in the words and your responses come naturally and are truly you. 

Long story short, let them know you’re listening to them and they will notice how easy it is to talk to you and how attentive you are. People tend to trust others who show that they are there for them. "

soc_196828,socialskills,reddit_comment,648,"Are you listening to people when they talk to you? I mean really listening. Listening to every word they say, digesting it, and focusing on point they're trying to make?

If you're allowing yourself to think more about how YOU feel when you're being talked to, you're not focusing on THEM. And that might be your main issue; it's absolutely hard to feel engaged and know what you want to say when youre preoccupied by how you feel and not on the content of the conversation they're trying to have with you. 

My advice would be to practice listening. 

One point I want to make clear is that the only thing you should be trying to get over is your feelings about conversations(being uncomfortable). The way you converse and the amount you like to say is not the issue, that is just you and you need to own it! So don't feel like you need to change anything about your behavior. Don't force yourself to say more than you want to. Dont force yourself to maintain eye contact or be super friendly if it doesnt feel natural. But you should work toward feeling comfortable in those situations and comfort comes from getting out of your head and pushing your feelings aside about the situation, and focusing on the words being said to you. 

If it's the other persons presence that makes you uncomfortable and zone out, you can even go as far as taking the person out of the equation. Don't worry about WHO they are. While stuff is coming out of their mouth, just listen to the words being sent your way. Absorb it. Forget that it's coming from someone, act like it's coming out of your TV.

Practicing to actively listen is hard and can often be muddled out for several reasons; social anxiety, a sense of entitlement, being preoccupied by thoughts, etc etc. You have to teach yourself to clear your mind and allow these words to enter your head. It's up to you to decide whether you can work through this by will power and police yourself enough, or if you need the guidance of a therapist because you might have social anxiety.

I promise though, if you work on this your social life will blossom. People love being listened to, so you will in turn make them feel important and they'll gravitate toward you. When you're focusing on only the words being sent to you and not the circumstances of the situation  (the person, feelings, thoughts, etc) it'll take pressure off of you and you're more inclined to give a natural response (because you're not thinking about other things), instead of a response pushed out of you after peeling off the layers of pressure you put on yourself.

Everyone who is saying to just ""blurt out whatever comes to your head"" is right, but I guess I just tried to elaborate more on the process of being able to do that in the first place.

Good luck!

edit: I just want to add that sometimes we put pressure on ourselves if we think the other person is so much better at something than us, and in this case it is being social. You might be thinking this way, or you might not. You might even be unaware of the fact that you're creating this comparison. And if you realize that you do make this comparison, remember this: everyone is doing the best with what they've got, just like you. Everyone had to start somewhere. Most people are faking their way through life. Most people are more preoccupied by not looking stupid in front of you, than judging your social skills. So if you catch yourself making comparisons - stop. That person is just as human as you and has had many awkward moments in life, don't psych yourself out by thinking otherwise. :)"

Secondly is that not a great way to approach a date?

The frame of you’re the interviewee is just asking to mess things up, and it’s insulting to yourself. Be confident. You have things to offer your crush that are of value and you get to decide whether they are a good fit for you or not. It’s up to you to decide.

soc_706565,socialskills,reddit_comment,373,"I believe that people shoudn't be able to control our moods by means of provocation. That means that you should train yourself to face adversity with a sense of calm and serenity.

That sometimes means that you pretend you didn't listen, or simply choose not to answer. Other times, it means that you answer with a self deprecating joke that kills their intention of hurting you, by showing your invulnerability.

But I also believe in boundaries, and that you should enforce them. Only you can know what you're capable of handling and how it affects your life. Also, I believe in not owning people anything, meaning that I am helpful and cooperative, but if people start making my life hard, I might stop being cooperative or even relate to this person (if possible).

Remember, some people simply don't have a mindset of abundance and think they are geniuses that can do everything alone. They think your success is their failure, they can't think team. And you just can't help everyone, because time isn't infinite and you should focus on those that want to be helped.

Do I do this all the time? I wish... Sometimes I do get really angry. But I do it often enough to know it's doable.

But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of  evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my  own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and  possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No  one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative,  or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes,  like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is  unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are  unnatural.”"
soc_782432,socialskills,reddit_comment,412,"Sounds like you have it worse than I do. But I'm still plagued by trust issues which is currently holding me back greatly in life. If you're not seeing one currently, see a therapist. 

1) Anxiety is something everyone can understand, most people experience some level of anxiety at some point in their life while talking to someone. Take it slow and get used to talking to people, therapists will often recommend striking up random conversations with people. A good way to do this is by complimenting other people, might make you feel better to!

2) Sometimes you just can't. Sometimes have little in common is a god thing, but to have a beat friend, or people you're close with you're going to need a way to build that trust with them. Best friends will often be just as important at relationships, they're harder to build as they aren't built the same way as a relationship typically would be.

3) Standard tips include joining groups you're interested in. You could throw yourself in the deep end by acting, singing etc. You could join a social sports team, whatever you think will be most comfortable for you. Personally I do backstage of theatre, lighting, let's me be arty without dealing with hand tremors as much, hands on work too let's me get my mind off stuff while working with my crew which I now lead. 

4) Being anxious is a byproduct of not trusting people you're with or your environment. I try are surround myself with people I know I can trust to not make me feel bad. Large groups may just make you feel like you're being judged. One of the best pieces of advice I've heard is that they're thinking about themselves as much as youre thinking about yourself. Everyone is caught up in their own little worlds, for the good and the bad. 

5) As I've kinda said above, the more you talk to people and trust them the more relaxed you will feel. Some people may always make you feel anxious, whether you realise it or not, these people may be mostly friendly, but they're not good friends for your mental health in this case. Again, time builds trust, we are talking from months to a year to solidify a good friendship. 

If you've got anything more that I can help you with let me know. And incase you're no in therapy, best thing you can do, hands down."
soc_131545,socialskills,reddit_comment,121,"The fact that you are talking about something you love is by no means a guarantee that a woman will not be bored. Trust me I'm an engineer.

You guys assume hobbies which have wide appeal. You can be into loads of things and most people will think you're as dull as a stone in a quarry if they're not into them. There are people who like accounting and there are people who collect stamps. Both are valid interests, but most people would die of boredom hearing about either.

Don't get me wrong, if you do absolutely nothing in life you should follow the advice above, but having a life you consider interesting does not mean you'll be interesting to others.

soc_859052,socialskills,reddit_comment,269,"Opening up to people might be what gets them closer to you. Spilling guts about some deep truths exposes part of yourself that might make people feel the same. However my biggest friendships have been based almost entirely on sense of humor. Someone you can bounce something off and they can run with it and have you two in laughing fits so long you forget what it was even about. 

What defines a close friend to you? 

I have had friends where we would talk everyday to the point we had about 10x the conversation together than with anyone else.

I've got people I still see at parties that I went to school with.

I have a friend group of people I used to share a hobby with (and sometimes do)

I am still friends with my mate I met in kindergarten and we are now on 30 years of friendship but due to his hours with work and distance we rarely see each other. 

I have other mates I would consider close but whom I never see. Mates who I know I could turn to if I needed help and if they needed me. 

After our baby was born though it gets increasingly harder to find any time for yourself and doing things with your friends. Catching up on social media is about as good as it gets lately but it works fine for me.

I would consider some of these close friends and others not so much but it depends on how you value friendship I guess is my point. It felt a bit ranting there. Sorry."
soc_1755428,socialskills,reddit_comment,127,"That's kinda normal. There's even a bit about that in Seinfeld, a famous sitcom: [https://youtu.be/NBZVaNpwub8](https://youtu.be/6w4K3Gt2SWk)

""I'm doing everything I can to prevent them from meeting"". It's up to you to realize if you're overdoing it and what it all means to you, but keep in mind it's a normal thing that happens to a certain extent.

I think it's more commonly about keeping jokes and mood of the friendships separate. If you ""mesh"" both friendships together, you have no idea what might come out from the other side. So there isn't inherently anything jealous about that, it's more about fear of not knowing what happens next.

However, I can't tell you if that's what you are feeling or if it's a bad thing. That's up to you."
soc_794955,socialskills,reddit_comment,277,"Sorry to hear you're going through this, social stuff can be hard depending on the people surrounding you. Maybe can try to see what commonalities are in situations that people are shitty to you versus situations where they have been nice. Maybe controversial, but I think It's easier to change your environment than your personality sometimes. 

On a personal note, being quieter has always made me the butt of jokes, and feel more ill-at-ease. I'm not sure why. Maybe it's the groups weird way of including the person being teased. I find that when I try to genuinely ask (non-controversial) questions I'm curious about from others ""what about that activity do you enjoy most? 'Have any fun plans this evening? I need ideas"" people like chatting, they'll tend to warm up to you.

Do this one on one with people until they get used to you. In a big group there may be pressure for group think, and it becomes popular or cool to jab at someone. If you become friendly with a few people on their own, this people won't do it, and eventually no one will. 

Also be okay at laughing at yourself, people tease too get a response, if you get flustered or visibility upset, people might find it funny and not realize how hurtful it is. Better to joke it off. Random example ""I hope fat/stupid (name) doesn't eat all of it before I get there"", maybe you can reply with ""well..maybe just be on time then"" in a joking way. If it doesn't get to you, people won't bother.

Anyway hope it helps, can let me know if you had any questions."
soc_1764560,socialskills,reddit_comment,207,"I think it's worst when you befriend someone who is way more attractive than you and hang out with them a lot. Note I'm not saying that it's you that makes this judgement of who is more attractive it's society. You start to see what an easy social life can look like. Woman and men coming up to talk to you, this sense of feeling visible, folks smiling at you and staring. The funny thing is that I'm somewhat successful, have a lot more 'long term' things going on for me i.e. career/wealth vs my attractive friend. But folks don't see that and don't wanna know... it's only about the surface. 

The good news is sometimes the people who come up to you etc. are fucked up, negative, and problematic... people I never want to really get to know despite their 'good looks.'

Despite that I've met some really nice people and I'm working on my looks. Folks now smile at me in the grocery store, I have frequently have ppl taking photos of me, I can get someones attention, and I feel better most days. I look good. 

There are definitely two worlds the best thing is be nice to everyone and be open to everyone."

You’ve ignored several of my points as well. I get that you don’t want to be bothered, but you are sending a message for men not to “bother” women when they want to get to know someone and have good intentions, you are perpetuating fear amongst women, you may not know the implications of what you’re saying but it’s dangerous territory. Also you are trying to dumb down my argument by assuming I’m a guy, which is also dangerous, as everyone can have valid thoughts. It’s a problem because perpetuating this type of negative message actually divides us as people, but if that’s what you want I guess it’s not a problem for you"
soc_213582,socialskills,reddit_comment,825,"I was going to make a throw-away account for this as well, butt fuck it (pun intended, kek) I am not afraid of who I am. I have never told ANYONE, not a single soul about this before.

I can't tell you what to do or what not to do. I can only tell you what I done and what happened afterwards, and advise on what you should do. The decision its self is yours, and what sort of situation you are in.

It first started in Year 8 (I was around 12 years old), and it was because I have ginger hair and was a little ""podgy"". It wasn't anything serious at first, but like yourself, it got real annoying real fast. Throwing pens and rubbers across the class at me, scribing over my notes, publicly shaming me with lies etc. (for some reason they decided to spread a rumour that I fucking STOLE a 15p packet of crisps)

Now I had my ""group"" of friends, wasn't really a group was more like 4 people. I just stuck with them, and they did nothing. They would just completely ignore me when the bullies were doing their thing, whether that be public humiliation or physical abuse.

I had never been bullied before, or realised that I was being bullied (looking back I realise that I was actually bullied throughout year 3-6 also, most of my school life actually), so at the time I did not understand that if I let them, they wont stop. And the didn't. Almost my entire secondary school life, from year 8 - Year 11, I let them do it. Never fighting back, never telling anyone, and it just got worse.

My mum would always ask me if I was being bullied, but I always assured her nothing was wrong. I have the type of family to go and punch a random parents face in, before asking me who it was. The type that tell me to be normal, and not spend so much time on computer games. The kind that got their kicks from all getting drunk together and victimising a random person, I'll be honest I never liked my family. None of them were like me, complete opposites. They were the bullies in school.

At first I started out-smarting them, call-backs etc. but that didn't help at all, in fact most of the time they were able to flip it around and onto me.

Eventually I just started ignoring the bullies, literally denied that they existed at all and everything they did just did't happen, because telling a teacher you were being bullied was the equivalent of ""snitching on someone in a murder case"" at my school. Not only that, but I had to make my own way into school &amp; home, which was a 1 hour journey so i was afraid what they would do after school. Then they started doing worse things, trying to provoke me. Following me everywhere, actually punching me in the gut or throwing apples at me across the school yard. After that, I purposely sat near the cafeteria staff at lunch, near the teachers desk during lessons etc. 

One day they just stopped.

I have no explanation for it, maybe they had lost interest/couldn't do it any more because their ""authority"" didn't extend past their own self security? Maybe it was because I wouldn't give them their ""kicks""? Honestly, I have no idea.

However this still affected me, I was always ""that kid"". The one to fuck up on a presentation, the one who can't speak to girls etc. Truth is, because of those bullies, I never got the chance to be ""normal"", people would just laugh at me and never give me a chance with anything. The only good thing I had going was my GCSE's, and even then I was barely passing. So consider what this may to do you long-term.

No one can tell you what to do, because everywhere is different. In one place, it's considered ""ok"" to go and tell somebody because the parents/teachers are actually decent people who will help you, but the same goes for the opposite (which, unfortunately, is what i had). Some people are just horrible people, and there is nothing we or anyone can do to change that.

I hope this can, in any way, help you with your situation and I hope its the right one. No one deserves to be bullied, unless they want to be the bully. Nasty little shits, all of them.


However I do advise you to not be like me. I am probably fucked up for life because I just let it happen. To this day I can not talk to girls,  i have to have everything i want on a list in my head before I make an order at a cafe, because I am still afraid of messing up.

Make the right decision my friend."

It is really crucial for my fiancé to introduce me. I'm not the type to just walk up to somebody I don't know and express great pleasure in meeting them, and to a lot of people that is rude.

soc_520687,socialskills,reddit_comment,172,"Not OP but I guess what this means is that what you are goes beyond your thoughts, emotions and actions. Negative or positive. 

It's kinda metaphysical but I guess the intent is to free yourself from automatisms and to center yourself. Meaning that from day to day you'll feel and do things that will make you feel bad or good. It's real, those things happen but in the end, it's just inertia and chaos. You can't control a lot of things but one thing remains true and pure whatever happens : your essence. 

Now what is your essence, I'm not sure, that's why it's a metaphysical question but in the end, what matters is to realize that whatever happens, whatever you think and do, there's a core to you that will stay true and unaffected by illusions (I'm no good, I'm the best, I do this, I don't do that, I'm different, I'm the same). It's liberating.

soc_1353299,socialskills,reddit_comment,173,"I'd go with 2. I lived by myself when I started at University while most people I know lived in shared apartments and as more of an introverted person I ended up isolating myself. When talking to my friends growing up and their experiences they often highlighted how when they were in a shared apartment they'll have that social circle and everyone there will have their own social circle based on classes, activities or whatever. Through that they meet a lot more people because the groups overlap. During my semesters abroad I also lived in shared apartments and found it made a huge difference because I got a long well with one of my roommates.

Also if you can overcome your aversion and work up the courage to just approach groups or introduce yourself it will make a big difference in Uni. It's a small thing but it sends a strong message to others. You can't go through life expecting people to always come up to you and welcome you into their groups."
soc_49734,socialskills,reddit_comment,245,"Wow, I just realized I've been responding to this post instead of following your replies. Sorry. Blame it on me trying to reply using a phone app last night.

9.40 is higher than the minimum wage we had when I was a student. Of course, I also took out student loans, and I think that's an option for you too if you haven't taken any yet.

As for finding a job with your degree. All you need to look at is how many people are in your program, and what the program's employment rate is (these should be numbers your college can provide you). If it's something abysmal, then you'll need to work hard, or consider switching to another program if you're not particularly passionate about the current one. If it's something reasonable, however, then there's plenty of reasons to be positive.

For example, if the employment rate is 50%, it means you just have to be among the better half to get a job. That shouldn't be too hard to do. There are lots of things that can help boost your job hunting once you get to that point, things that most people wouldn't do, that would make you stand out over them, and they usually only just require initiative.

Of course it depends on your specific field, which I don't know about. Still, life presents problems, but problems can always be solved, and solving them will make you feel powerful and in control."

It's very natural for me to catch the emotion from their face and mimic their same energy. If they smile very brightly when they tell you about the shoes, smile as bright as them and ask questions. 
People will have the instant connection to you, they won't think you are interrogating them (unless they are happy and your facial expression looks like you disapprove with them on their new shoes).

soc_947670,socialskills,reddit_comment,294,"What he said and how he's been acting is incredibly rude, and it sound like he doesn't even care about maintaining a friendship with you. And if that's the case and it's going to be an entirely one-sided friendship on your part like that (with him either ignoring you completely, giving minimum-effort responses, or being rude like that), then personally I don't think it would even be worth it trying to maintain a crappy friendship like that in the first place. It's cool that you two used to be close friends, but whether you just grew apart or he started turning into more of a... a rude person, let's call it, it doesn't sound like it's the same kind of friendship now as it may have been before.

It's up to you to decide if you just wanna sorta minimize contact with him and see if anything improves on his side if you think things might change for the better, but if you prefer to just cut off contact with him then that's your choice too. It's okay to have different kinds of friendships with different kinds of people, from close friendships to casual ones and ones that are just based on a common shared interest like playing a game together or going to school together. Not all friendships are going to remain the same as people change and sometimes grow distant from each other, so you just have to be honest with yourself about what kind of friendship seems likely with this person based on how things are going (which is not very well atm). And if this friendship is winding down, well, you can always start looking for others to become friends with who won't disregard you like this.

Hope that helps!"
soc_316436,socialskills,reddit_comment,264,"&gt;They say you should tell a story, but they never say anything unless you initiate. They tell you to ask questions, but with many of these people I seem to be the only one asking them when the conversation dies a bit. What's worse is when it's obvious that you're the one with inferior social skills and they make it up to you to be talkative.

The simplest answer to your conundrum is that you're asking the incorrect questions or following lines of questions that aren't interesting and/or thought provoking to the people you're talking to. 

A good conversation is never really one sided. It has an ebb and flow to it. If you were a fisherman and you were throwing your hook out over and over and catching no fish....wouldn't you change your lure? Maybe change your bait, or simply move to a different area and cast again? 

Now for the tough love.

Speaking as a so called ""socially fluent"" individual when someone is socially awkward and is trying to *really* push the conversation it's borederline painful. There is no flow to the conversation because the questions are robotic and formulaic or simply repetitive. 

There is a certain point where you stop politely responding to the questions or to the socially awkward person and begin to clam up, only giving one word or single gesture answers. 

**You** need to be *aware* of these clues and try to change your direction or methodology before it happens. 

* Change the lure.
* Change the bait.
* Or change your location.


*But keep on fishing.* =)

soc_40525,socialskills,reddit_comment,247,"I hesitate to post in this subreddit ever because frankly I really can't relate.  But I'll say this:

&gt;There, I always had the highest marks and graduated from high school with an overall average of 98.4%. This, however, meant that i was the kid that got picked on automatically and people distanced themselves from me so that they wouldn't be associated with the nerd. This isolated me and turned me into a social outcast with no social skills.

This is bullshit.  You got great grades and were focused on school, but people don't actually pick on and isolate kids because they are intelligent. 

I see that stuff all the time on this subreddit...and elsewhere.  This is an attribution problem.  Your intelligence and inability to socialize are mutually exclusive.  I know this because some of the brightest kids in my high school went on to great colleges and continued to be brilliant, and guess what? They had a great social life too.

If there weren't big ramifications to this flawed thinking, I could leave it alone, but I think you handicap yourself by failing to identify the actual problem.  I can't say what the actual problem is, I don't know you, but passing it off onto the fact that you care about and are good at school is just bullshit.

Well that's hard to believe given everything else you've written.

&gt; i don't go out to clubs or parties and i'm not on any dating apps.

Yeah, and where do you think most 16-22 year olds meet people? Parties, and apps. Seriously, the advice coming from people here is not coming from people who are your age, meeting people. Either go to house parties with your friends who have large friend groups, go out down the town, or download the apps.

&gt; however i feel like the kind of guy I want to be with wouldn't be at a club either.

Well that's nonsense because people from all walks of life can enjoy going to a club every now and again.

&gt; and it seems to me that dating apps are just for hookups.

They're not. 

&gt; i occasionally go to bars with my friends but I don't get too drunk and usually go home earlier than everyone else.

You don't need to get drunk to have a good time, but going home early is totally counter productive to meeting someone if that's what you're out for. Also, if you just stay with your friends all the time, very few guys are going to approach a whole group of women, vs approaching you alone or with 1 friend at the bar.

&gt; physically i have a nice figure, more on the thin side, and lots of people have called me pretty in my life including my guy friends

And why haven't you asked any of them out?

&gt; it never bothered me before as i always had other things to focus on but now it's starting to get to me, especially that i feel like i'm losing my youth

Your youth isn't pining over an imaginary boyfriend, it's going out living your life and building self confidence so you can have fun doing lots of different things to build character, so that you can bring that confidence into your search for meaning.

&gt; and also seeing great guys end up and settle with girls that don't really appreciate them. 

You sound like a total 'nice girl' here. Any chance there's one guy you liked too much who never liked you and you spent too long waiting for him to notice you?

&gt; i am more of a serious person but i can be flirty, in a more sarcastic and ""teasing"" way rather than laughy/touchy and playing dumb way. 

Yeah, sounds like a sure fire way to make someone think 'she's not interested' or 'rude'. 

&gt; please be honest and tell me what you think from what i wrote.

I think you know exactly what you're doing wrong and you're too stubborn to relax and do what everyone else does that you know works already.

&gt; do you think i should put myself out there more?

Yes, obviously.

&gt; try a dating app? 

Yes, obviously.

&gt; any advice will be appreciated. thanks

You already know what you should be doing and you're not doing it. Are you shy? Anxious? Only you know, work on being more confident and easy going, copy what other people do, there's literally no reason not to."
soc_509535,socialskills,reddit_comment,120,"The primary thing that gets you noticed is genuineness and confidence.

For a guy, confidence is extremely attractive and genuineness makes you extremely approachable.  Plus, it'll attract the right kind of people (i.e. the kind of people you want to be friends with).

Confidence is something that's present when you're both in and out of your element.

For example, I'm a very confident person.  When I'm at a party of complete strangers, I can cleverly work the room to get to know people, chat with people, etc.  When I'm in a small group, I have no problems starting/engaging in personal and stimulating conversations.

soc_873151,socialskills,reddit_comment,511,"You also are definitely taking a step in the right direction by wanting to make friends. If you had a relatively healthy friendship with one of your old friends, talk to them when you’re ready and feel in a better place. It could take years, or it could just take a few months. It’s your choice whether or not you want to tell new friends about old friends. If you do, keep it relatively to the point. The ones who do care will stay and listen, and if you really like the new friends you make then the old friends won’t matter much in the grand scheme of things. I know how it feels, it’s rough when you don’t feel like you have anyone as a teen. I didn’t have close friends until I went to college, and they’re all several years older than I am. I bonded with my two closest friends over anime and punk rock because one was wearing a Naruto jacket and the other was wearing an MCR shirt when I first met them! I took the spark of happiness I felt and ran with it without thinking whether or not I came off as a dork. It’s been 7 years and we only got closer with a few roadblocks here and there, so there is hope.

Your peers are still learning and hopefully maturing. You’re still maturing as well, and you do have the capabilities to change your mindset if you choose, but it’s a long, hard process and it does require action. Honestly, high school is just a speck in your life. I left high school in the past immediately when I went to college. I didn’t tell any of my college friends about the high school friends who screwed me over because it really wasn’t their business, and I knew it wouldn’t make my relationship with my new friends any better. If they asked, I just said I bonded with them differently and sometimes depression got in the way, but I didn’t make my mental health or past my identity. I was also lucky enough to have friends who supported me through my bouts of depression. I eventually learned that people won’t get to know you if you don’t talk, and it includes talking over social media. 

It seems like you’re fine with talking over the internet. Sometimes what I do is occasionally pm or comment on a an acquaintance-friend’s Instagram to start small conversations during the moments I’m actually on, even if they’re short. Sometimes it’s the little changes. Are you social media savvy and have hobbies you really enjoy? Post about it when you find the energy to do them! Are you going to college or working? You will most likely meet at least one person there if you open up. Don’t get me wrong, took a lot of sitting, reflecting, and swallowing my pride. Keep in mind sometimes people click, and sometimes they don’t. Try not to let it discourage you too much, you have so much time to grow 🖤."
soc_1080520,socialskills,reddit_comment,146,"I think there are two answers. The first is the obvious ones, about listening, being authentically positive and supportive, etc.

The second, though, is why do you want this? If it's because you've been told you're a selfish jerk who needs to think about others more from a reliable source, ok. But if you're doing this because you want people to like you and form relationships with you, I don't think this is the way. People get the most value from people who are secure in themselves enough to be available, to be reliable, and to also be self-possessed. Good boundaries, a healthy sense of self \*and\* empathy is what helps you get relationships. And really, once you have those things, you won't feel the intense need for relationships to fill your void, and it'll make them easier to come by anyway.

Just my two cents."

soc_344785,socialskills,reddit_comment,228,"Well, you said you can talk to everyone but girls. Have you ever thought that (even beautiful) girls are just as human as these other people? The problem, I think, is... when you talk to common people you aren't expecting anything, but when you talk to girls you are expecting something. Have you ever tried to talk to a girl without any expectations? For example, how do you feel when you are at the McDonald's and you are talking to a female attendant? Maybe it is just because you are feeling alone that you're expecting something.

Well, let me  share my point of view (it's your choice to think about it or not, and there's neither reward for thinking nor a punishment for not thinking - I'm no guru): no girl will fill the hole you're feeling inside (not even friends could!), only you are capable of filling it. And what do you need to do this? Well, nothing. You already have everything. The moment of clarity will come if you are willing to persist. Ah! About your speech impediment? Well, it's a speech impediment, not a ""whole life impediment"" (I bet you can walk, you can read, you can play an instrument, you can do mathematics, and fly a kite and make a child smile if you want). How are you facing life?

Hope you the best!"
soc_990253,socialskills,reddit_comment,150,"To an extent, what you describe is normal - it's what people mean when they say they click better with some people than with others.  There's also the difference between immediate clicking, as happened with the first guy, and connection that builds over time.  It might just take you a bit longer to find that connection with the others.  It doesn't mean anything's wrong with you or with the others.

However, being the only one POC (or the only one of anything, really) does often get in the way of connecting.  Not because of you, because of prejudices or, at best, unconscious assumptions that people hold in their heads.  This is also something that could resolve as they get to know you better, but it's up to you whether you want to invest and potentially waste your precious time on these people, or whether you'd be better off looking elsewhere."

If I ask her directly to address an issue, she'll respond with a one-line also (she's in bad mood and probably sees that I'm just an older brother just reacting to her bad mood). I believe having her trust you would be to show that you will be with her and listen to her no matter what. She will choose the time to open up to you when the mood is right. See how her day is. Get her food. Do indirect things to make her see that you just...care about her not because things are going bad for her and that she is in shitty mood but because you are her brother. Girls most times are not looking for a solution in a talk, but they are looking for a person to vent to (different from us guys). The world is shit and we are not the wisest beings in relationships. But actively show your care for her not in just words but actions too. Also, if you see her hurting herself, know yourself clearly why that action is wrong. The ""what"" is important but ""why"" is all the more important also. When she is angry and bitching at you (maybe idk), be patient and listen to her. I say listen a lot but I think we really don't take our listening skill to a deeper level. At this point I am just rambling, but if you need, have her interact online maybe.

As in, when I walked into his work (where I worked out daily) he would go to a different section of the building- not in an obnoxious, passive aggressive way, but in a, ""I want to be polite, but you mean a lot to me so it hurts that you don't want to be together- but that's your right and out of respect for that right and your decision, I'm going to take my break during the time you usually workout."" In that situation, it made it clear to me that 1) he understood I was a human who has the right to decide who I hang out with (sometimes when guys come on too strong it seems like they don't have a regard for the girls decision to not date). So I appreciated that, and it gave me the space to see that I missed talking to him daily. You have given her neither of those. From the messages you said, it definitely sounds like she's just being polite."
soc_1637883,socialskills,reddit_comment,140,"As probably the best response to your comments explained, marketing has niches and not everyone receives the same doses of the same marketing. 
Different people are also more or less susceptible to the marketing which they do consume.

So for an extreme example, some people watch all the telemarketing ads and instantly believe they need to order whatever is being sold. 

Some other people are staunch individuals and don't just follow whatever trend is being pushed through marketing, but on the other hand, the ad management algorithms on their social media pages figure out what they're interested in and lean into that when offering more and more tailored marketing. 

TLDR: Marketing affects people in various ways and to different extents. But it's rare for marketing to have zero effect on personal preference if a person consumes any type of media."

The cool thing is that I actually got the job on the second one. So on the next interview you go to try to think it as something not so serious but as some kind of a joke if that makes sense :D"
soc_1342663,socialskills,reddit_comment,650,"What I write might sound harsh, but it is coming from a good place.  First, you are looking at life as if it is black and white when in reality it is shades of grey.  Your choice of words such as ""am I the bad guy"" as opposed to the good guy (I don't think any of you guys are ""bad guys""), ""he was almost perfect"" (perfect or flawed), and etc.  The truth is all of you did shitty things and good things as would be expected from any human.

Second, you can't control other people.  You can only control your own actions.  So, focusing on what you could have done better is more productive and healthier.  So, I'll talk about that.  You keep saying that in the summer you did everything for them including changing which puts a uncomfortable burden on your friends (it's like implying that I'm doing all this for you, so you owe me is the feeling I'm getting. Doing stuff for others is a gift that should require nothing in return.  It feels like you are keeping track like a scorecard).   But in reality, what you were doing was for yourself so you could be with your friends, to improve yourself and your life.   You did say that you had the best summer of your life.  

&amp;#x200B;

""I then pulled James to the side, explained that if he would take those class morons instead of me, and spend ALL of his time with them only, we can no longer be friends If our friendship means anything to him.""  You should NEVER do this to a friend.  Your phrasing is manipulative and you put him in a lose/lose situation no matter what he chose.  It would have been better if you had said something like: I can't believe all the shit they say about you.  Your so damn cool, you deserve better.  Or something along those lines.  You say that you are a ""true"" friend, but a good friend doesn't judge his friends, they accept them for who they are,  all their strengths and weaknesses.  

&amp;#x200B;

 ""William even started inviting those ""friends"" from class to group hangouts, but I was always excluded"".  My guess from what I read is that it is because you made him feel like you were judging him for hanging out with his ""friends"".  ""We started going to school again, our last year. James, Michael, William flopped back to others in the class, without a second thought. They did include me in activities for one month, but then nothing.""  It seems like they made an effort to include you in the first month but your judgmental attitude made them not want to include you any more.  I'm probably wrong it could be other reasons.  But, if how you write is indicative of how you acted around them, it would make them not want to include you.

""When I started hanging out with them, I swore to myself I would NEVER let them down, they travelled here to see me, to hang out with me, and I will NEVER make them regret that decision"".   I think this is the worst part because you broke a promise to yourself.  Regardless of the reason, when you put them in difficult situations, or start shitting on them then you have broken your promise to yourself.  You are making things conditional.  You will NEVER let them down as long as they don't do things you dislike.  If you don't mean it then don't say it.  If you do mean it then try to live by it.

I don't think you are a ""bad"" guy.  I think you are young and immature as is normal.  My advice is try to look at what happened as a blessing.  You went through a horribly shitty situation but you have an opportunity to learn from it and come out stronger."
soc_1662208,socialskills,reddit_comment,204,"Honestly it's a pretty broad question because there are a lot of factors at play. It depends on your sense of humour and her's, how much of a rapport you already have with her, what you usually talk about. When it comes to not crossing that line it's pretty simple. Just don't sexualise her in a joking or non joking way and respect her boundaries. You can joke and be professional. You should be aiming for your jokes to be harmless. I worked at a care home and some of the clients would watch a lot of musicals. One day Grease was on and for whatever reason I decided to tell my coworker that I hadn’t seen it before and had only seen Grease 2, with it being a favourite film of mine. This became a running gag where she would call bullshit and I would try to keep a straight face when I assure her that I'm telling the truth. It's not hilarious typing it now, but it was a harmless joke that was situational and didn't get in the way of us working professionally. It's probably best to just let it happen naturally rather than think of ways to joke with her."
soc_1276533,socialskills,reddit_comment,158,"&gt;Do people normally get beer or mixed drinks?

Up to the individual if you're at a place that offers both. Been on plenty of dates where the girl gets a cocktail and I get a beer.  


&gt;Do you normally sit down at a table or sit at the bar?

I tend to opt for a table, gives you a bit more privacy which can be helpful if you're naturally shy and don't want the bartender swinging by in the middle of conversation to ask if you want another round.  


&gt;Do you order food?

I always tend to plan these after lunch or dinner, for the basic reason that food will jack up the price of the date (I always plan on covering the both of us, your views may be different.) But this is really your call and something your date would probably appreciate if a ""drink or two"" turns into a long time together that goes well."

It felt random, but it was also very sweet and I appreciated that they had thought of me. I now do this from time to time too, but it's important to keep your expectations in check--they may not be interested in carrying on a friendship or even a conversation and that's okay.

One thing is that you say you're a bad texter (same, so its fine!), but make sure that if you text them and they do respond, that you are willing to carry on the conversation. The worst thing you could do is reach out to them, they respond, and then you ghost (I've done this and felt terrible).

As far as X and Z, I would take longer to decide if it's really worth it. Are these people you care about/want to know how they are doing, or are you more just curious/bored/lonely?

I have social anxiety like you wouldn't believe (ironic, right? Not talking to people leaves me with no energy but talking to people uses up all my energy). I'm not going to say ""just don't worry about it,"" because that's not how anxiety works. The only way I've found is to just go for it. I'm always terrified at first, but after a while, it gets easier. Once you have a success under your belt, it gets easier to keep acting. You remember how well it went last time, and maybe this time won't go well, _but maybe it will._ Your anxiety will always look for the worst, so you have to look for the best.

Look at how people treat you. Find a place you can hang out and bring your laptop, a book, your phone, and listen to the social interactions going on around you. If you're in the US, Panera is great to hang out. Buy a drink and a bagel/pastry/lunch and just listen to some conversations. No one will bat an eye unless you're staring directly at them.

If yes, great! If not, figure out exactly which parts you arent happy with, and more importantly, exactly why you aren't happy with those aspects of your personality, and work, slowly, on changing them.

Either way you will have some challenges to overcome, but the most important thing is to be who you WANT TO BE, and not who you THINK you should be. At the end of the day you can only change if you want to.

As with anything, small changes introduced slowly are the way to go, doing a full 180 flip will only cause more problems.  College is a great time to experiment!

Also it helped to recognize that I really wanted people to like me. And to acknowledge that if someone doesn't like me, it's ok, it's not my business. I don't like everyone and not everyone will like me. And the need to be liked goes back to when humans lived in tribes and being liked and accepted was crucial to survival. If you weren't accepted you'd be cast out from the tribe and it was literally life or death in terms of food and shelter. It's not as important to be liked anymore but the evolutionary need is still there. So it helps me to think about that and remember it's not life or death anymore, it just feels that way.

Forget gender, being excluded in a social situation like this is not a good feeling. Yes he has the right to ignore her, but she will not be wrong in feeling offended as well.  Based on OP's story, sounds like he is going out of his way to ignore her. 

Who knows why this dude was acting like this but I suggest asking your friend if she noticed that her bf was being weird. Next time you see him, take control.

soc_1552259,socialskills,reddit_comment,388,"First of all, I don't think there's any life advice in the form of just a short imperative — Be yourself! Be kind! Don't listen to what others say about you! Treat others as you'd like to be treated yourself! Etc. — that's actually meaningful on its own. Life is complex, people are complex, society is complex, cultures are complex. 
If you want good advice, you'll have to look deeper than that, which is exactly what you're doing here. You're wondering how to apply all that conflicting advice to your own life, yet find you can't always follow it  And naturally so, because how *could* you always be yourself if there are so many situations where that would either be detrimental to yourself or to others you care about? How *could* you love yourself unconditionally when there are aspects about you that don't align with the kind of person you want to be?

As a general rule: How good can advice be if following it would make you become a person you'd despise? If giving in to your urge to punch someone means stooping to the level of an animal, it can't be the right option, if that's not what you want to be. Is there a way to compromise, i.e. can you express yourself in a way that you don't have to do things that don't align with your own set of values? 

You're not your urges. You're not the first thought that pops into your head. If you want to love yourself, yet keep improving, remember that your choice not to punch the guy — for you know it'd be wrong — is just as much if not more a part of you as is your urge to do it, for you *chose* not to do it. Those urges may be a part of you, but you don't need to love *every aspect* of yourself in order to love yourself. Your wish for improvement is a legitimate part of you, not some sort of betrayal for your self-love.

So, a better way to look at it would be to ask: What's the point in this specific piece of advice? How does it help you live your best life? And for that, you need to know what values you hold and how important they are to you."

Basically everyone’s entitled to a free option to step away from a text conversation at any time and return at any time, and your choice to not step away at all does not obligate the other person to do the same. If you want a live conversation, then a phone call or face to face is best because it has implied time boundaries - you both know when it has started and when it has ended."

Explain to her that you find her attractive, in terms of whatever you think is causing this infatuation. But the most important thing is that if she does reject your feelings and ONLY wants to be friends, you need to accept that closure and move on.

soc_313917,socialskills,reddit_comment,274,"First, you should focus on yourself--do what makes *you* happy. It might seem like a small thing, but it really shows when you're enjoying yourself and it can make a huge difference. If people can see that you're having fun, they'll likely be interested and may even want to join you. 

If you find a few places you enjoy spending time: the library, the beach, a cafe, etc., you're one step closer to finding people who have similar interests too. If you frequent one of these places, you'll be likely to see/recognize other 'regulars', who you can then approach.

In most social situations, people aren't looking around thinking 'oh, look at that guy. I don't like him.' (People who do this honestly just have issues with themselves). Most often, people are just curious about you. If you keep your posture relaxed and open, people are more likely to (subconsciously) have a better impression of you. Smiling is a small thing you can do, (it helps to think of something funny--I visualize memes while at work to help me smile more) as well as making eye contact, if you're not yet comfortable with starting conversations.

I know it's hard to get over self-esteem issues, but just know that everyone is different. There isn't a single person alive who doesn't have at least one thing about themselves they aren't satisfied with. You are the only **you** there is, so just focus on the best things you have and make them greater. Become the greatest you! Exercise, read, get plenty of sleep, drink some coffee, do whatever will get you motivated.

soc_381110,socialskills,reddit_comment,286,"The comment about writing down your feelings is solid and I too suggest you do that. But here is something I think might help. 

I keep hearing a lot of people in this forum bring up the idea of ""not being invited to events by their friends"". And here is my take on that. 

I think there is too much of a focus on ""me"" and not enough on ""them"". In other words, how can you ADD value to others in a way that will make them want to hang out with you?

Let's say your friends are throwing a party soon and you hear them talking about it. 

How could you add value to that party? 

Well, if you worked at a place like Jimmy Johns(sandwich shop), you could say, ""Hey guys, I heard your throwing a party. If you need food or catering, I could talk to my boss and see if he'd be willing to give you a discount if you bought enough food.""

Now imagine if you are those other people and someone came up to you saying they could possibly get you a discount on catered food. 

You'd be like heck yea, this dude is awesome! Even if you can't get the discount from your boss and they have to pay full price, at least you come off as a guy/gal who knows how to add value to the situation. 

Do you see how if you adopted this mentality, you would probably be sought after more often. And again, you don't have to work at a sandwich shop to do this. It could be anything. But think of how you could add value and start doing it. 

Hope that helps.

soc_1749670,socialskills,reddit_comment,271,"Usually, the thing that helps in this situation is awareness. Each time you notice that you did this and feel regret, that signals to your brain that you don't want to do that anymore, and that your brain should take note of this so you can do something differently.

If you can't seem to change despite having the intention to change, it's quite possible you have different parts of you working at cross-purposes.

For me, I've also found it quite hard to change certain things about how I communicate with people. It's because when I was talking to new people, I felt like I was about to die, or like if I made any wrong move, something terrible would happen. In other words, my fear of screwing up socially in the moment was way stronger than my intention to do any given thing, so the fear would always win.

For me, it's been important to just address that sense of anxiety and pressure when interacting with people. It's much more important to realize that no matter what happens, I'm not going to die and I'm not going to be exiled based on this one interaction. I have to be able to forgive myself for how the interaction goes no matter what happens. I have to make my goals more modest - in other words, success is not whether I did everything correctly, but just whether I noticed my feelings of anxiety and could sit with them without believing them. 

I can't say what ""my"" intentions are for any given conversation because there are different ""me's"" in play which want different things."

I stick around the people who are there to have fun or at least open to it. I try to include everyone as much as possible but I'm not going to pry my way into someone's bubble who doesn't want to join the party. This is doubly true for people who've very clearly decided before arriving that they aren't going to enjoy themselves. 

The main thing I can recommend is practice and persistence until it becomes natural. Be kind to yourself in your choice of friends and be the kind of friend you want to have and model the kind of relationships you want to have."
soc_1170534,socialskills,reddit_comment,947,"Ok, so you feel like they made you feel inferior. That's fair. Acknowledge those feelings.

Think about that. That person made you feel inferior.

Did they, really? Do you think that every interaction between two human beings has to be where one is superior and the other one is inferior? So when two people are contesting an opinion, do you think that the person who is factually correct is inherently superior?

&amp;#x200B;

You say that they made you feel inferior because they don't want to tell you why you don't click with them. I think that's a fair thought. I wouldn't say it's accurate but I relate to you because I've been exactly in this place.

&amp;#x200B;

Let it go bro. You can do it. Be your own self. I know it's the fucking hardest thing you'll have to do in your life. What do you think life's biggest battles are? I'm talking about the battles with yourself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just think about it. When shit hits the fan you have to convince yourself that you need to take action. As much as anyone can tell you, yell at you to do something, the final decision is yours, it's your call. Where do I want to get with this?

Well, I think that your problem is more centered around perspective. You're saying damned if you do tell them you're interested in them and damned if you don't tell them you're interested in them. Let's call this interest your token. You're making the whole thing about the fact that you're giving people your token and they won't tell you why they don't want it.

&amp;#x200B;

When you look at it this way, maybe, maybe, you'll realize that you are already putting them up to debt with you by throwing them your token. What if they weren't ready to receive a token from anyone not particularly you? What if that person has decided they really can't handle tokens right now? Do you think it's fair for them to have to externalize such a difficult personal decision that that might be to them that they can't handle new people in their lives? 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's suppose that they just simply don't like your token, they think it's ugly. So what? If you knew that they thought that way, or if they told you that, would you want to know? If so, what would that information be useful for?

&amp;#x200B;

See, with most things in life, the most important things are a matter of perspective. Think about it this way, if you want to seek people into your life, you must be aware that it is a decision you are making, therefore it is you putting yourself out there, not the other way around. 

&amp;#x200B;

And if you do decide that you're putting yourself out there, it's on you. What I mean to say is that the fact that you have decided to reach out to people does not automatically grant you a response or any reasoning whatsoever. If you want to do this YOU NEED to LEARN how to take people at face value. Meaning, you must not expect anything from people. If you want to reach out to people, remove expectation from the equation.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have made the choice to put yourself out there to others, you need to make yourself aware that you need to focus on what you are going to say, how you are going to say it, and what you really want to say. Stop thinking about what they will respond, that's going to kill you mentally. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just think about it like, ""I had a strong feeling to reach out to this person, and so I did. I did so respectfully and I put myself out there and showed myself as a valuable person. PERIOD."" That's all you need to know about the interaction. Forget about everything else.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, if you do get a positive response, take it as a BONUS, not as the expected norm. Hell, even getting JUST a response, regardless if it's positive or negative, should be taken as a BONUS.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm trying to say is that putting yourself out there should not be a burden to others, it should be a conscious decision on your part to bring new people into your life and be aware that everyone lives their own hell and everyone is hyper-focused on themselves and what you think is someone seeing you as worthless could just be someone you tried to talk to and they probably were in the middle of a personal crisis. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's so much we don't know about other people that assuming even the slightest feels so wrong, and putting yourself out there and expecting people to react the way you want them to feels like you're taking the magic out of the whole experience.

&amp;#x200B;

It's just life bro. Nobody knows with certainty where we're going. That couple that married 30 years ago and are still married probably aren't even sure why they married in the first place. In the end, the best thing we can do is be a blessing not a burden to others, look around for the people that are ALREADY in your life and perhaps you might find people that want to get closer to you that are ALREADY IN YOUR LIFE that you're ignoring because you're grasping at straws trying to get new people into your life.

&amp;#x200B;

Make your life easier. Make other peoples' lives easier. Be kind, understanding, empathetic; life is to be enjoyed, not to constantly be held accountable for the way you respond to unexxpected situations or unexpected solicitations."
soc_792753,socialskills,reddit_comment,412,"- Avoid being too cocky and try to draw attention 
- Do not try different strategies like: 
* Answering late to show you don't care
* Trying to be alpha and saying absurd stuff
* Being over talkative and making a lot of jokes
* Making fun of the people so he/she would think that you are alpha male or some tough guy.
- Listen more than you talk. Some people try to impress others with their knowledge on a subject, or they try to impress by showing their skills, but I think knowledge means absoluetly nothing in this situation, just shut your mouth until it is asked, believe me it feels awesome when people realize that being a high ranked manager is not a big deal for you because you dont talk about it.
- Do not show a lot of interest, but you can still show interest by showing disinterest. Like cutting off contact with someone all of a sudden means you are affected.
- Be an adult and handle emotional people. That's too important. Don't get mad at things, instead, try to understand and communicate. Because acting with emotion is always a downvote for a man. 
- People would gossip about each other, don't fall to this, you are better than that. Feeling envy means you are a loser in the background. Just be happy for people when they are succesful. 

One simple trick to act like a normal and adult man is, when you see a  situation where you dont know how to act, think it like ""how would an adult, healthy minded, polite and quality person answer to this?"". This strategy earned me my first girlfriend. She respected me a lot. But when I lost my adult behaving, she brokeup with me. Now I am at square one.

Remember if someone is going to be interested in you, they will imply it when you make a normal talk with them. You don't need to show extra strategies to make people show interest in you. 

There are a lot of guys out there flooding the girls' insta accounts with stupid messages. I can smell a hunter guy like this from miles away. I see them try to impress and stuff. Their behaviour is screaming like ""I have no life when I get back to my home.""

Maybe there should be some room for relaxation, but not too much time should be spent on relaxation. Relationships will take too much time off his study time.

I suppose that's something well have to agree to disagree on. His studies should be his focus, no doubt about that. But they shouldn't occupy all of his time. That's for two main purposes, in my mind. Firstly, doing nothing but studying and a *bit* of relaxation for 4 years will drive you insane. Besides that, it could lead to an immense amount of stress that could leave to harsh health problems. I mean, I'm speaking from experience. I'm in uni, with a double major and a minor plus research plus extracurriculars (clubs and such) plus a decent social life. I've tried the whole ""doing nothing but studying"" schtick. It was awful and completely unsustainable. Which brings me to my second point: there's no need to. You're presenting studying and a relationship as mutually exclusive, but they're not. You can have both. Maybe you're GPA will drop 0.2 points, but that's nothing in the grand scheme of things. Plus you'll be healthier with an outlet for stress. 

2) humans crave intimacy because nature wants humans to mate. The second you ejaculate, boom, desire for intimacy is now gone. Why do you think you feel weird and slightly disgusted after you masturbated? That’s right. That’s just nature trying to drive you to reproduce. That’s why you have the desire for intimacy in the first place. Once you ejaculate, you have basically tricked nature into thinking that you have successfully mated. And as for the desire for connections? That can be achieved with Male friends. It doesn’t have to be female

I'm not a psychologist, so I'm not going to try to disprove any of the points you make here about it (although I doubt that you have a huge amount of psychology trying either). But anecdotally, I feel that you're wrong about most of these points. I'll address these point by point.

&gt; humans crave intimacy because nature wants humans to mate.

I don't know enough about psychology to comment, but a citation wouldn't be unwarranted.

&gt;The second you ejaculate, boom, desire for intimacy is now gone.

Except it's not though. Feeling horny and wanting close emotional intimacy aren't synonymous. One is a physical desire, and one is a mental, emotional one. One I crave intimacy I want to experience a close emotional bond, where I just feel comfortable with someone and they feel comfortable with me. 

&gt;Why do you think you feel weird and slightly disgusted after you masturbated?

I don't? I feel pretty alright after masturbating. Not weird or even slightly disgusted in the least.

&gt;That’s right. That’s just nature trying to drive you to reproduce.

Eh...I'm not a psychologist, but a citation wouldn't be unwarranted.

&gt;That’s why you have the desire for intimacy in the first place. Once you ejaculate, you have basically tricked nature into thinking that you have successfully mated.

Not commenting on the wonky masturbation point (citation needed for it), the fact that you can have or desire close intimacy with friends that you don't want to have sex with kind of disproves your point. 

&gt;And as for the desire for connections? That can be achieved with Male friends. It doesn’t have to be female

My point exactly.

&gt;3) being a good partner shouldn’t be his primary concern now. 

It shouldn't, but like I said, there's no reason why you can't work toward it. There's enough hours in the day. Learning guitar or playing Overwatch aren't my primary concerns but I sure as hell find time to do them.

&gt;4) good memories can be achieved with Male friends. Memories coming from relationships specifically is not necessary as long as good memories are formed

Yeah, but like I said. If someone wants to get into a relationship, there's not reason to ignore that desire. I mean, you're even saying that you can have time to hang out with male friends and study. Under that logic, why can't he spend some of that time working towards being more comfortable with girls? Besides, you and I both know that a romantic intimate relationship is much different than hanging out with male friends. Putting both under the umbrella of creating ""good memories"" is disingenuous.

&gt;5) if I could have an awesome life where I don’t have to worry about money instead of having a life in which money flows out of my pockets like river water but I get to have a life partner , I’d rather not choose the latter.

If two people are in a relationship and they differ on whether to abstain, that could lead to some serious issues. Sex is very important to a healthy relationship for people who are sexual. If you are in a relationship and both want to abstain, then good for you. It ultimately is a personal choice between people.

I don’t think of it as old-fashioned, but just cuz something is old-fashioned doesn’t make it good. The inverse can be true as well but being compatible on this is crucial for a relationship to succeed."
soc_943959,socialskills,reddit_comment,146,"2 things:

1. Stall (in a mature way). Basically buy yourself some time to think more rationally. Rather than say yes in the moment, say something like “let me get back to you on that” and then take time to assess whether it’s something you want to and should do.

2. Say a positive no. If after your assessment, you’d rather not do said thing, go back with a short, crisp reason starting with a polite “I would have loved to do xyz but there is abc other thing I have to do instead.” Showing that your choice was for something else shows that you didn’t turn them down thoughtlessly. Pause for a response and resist the urge to over-explain. For extra mileage with the relationship, offer some hope for possibly doing said thing in the future, but give no promises or hard deadlines. 

Good luck!"
soc_1234442,socialskills,reddit_comment,183,"In my experience, if you make friends... you will realize that they have their lives too, and their lives and facts are often more important than being available or worried for you. It's normal to be a friend, and having a life; it's okay if you want to pass some time alone, if you wish time to care for yourself. There isn't a right ""meter"", to establish how much time you need. There isn't a ""right"" way to be friends, if you are loyal; do not feel guilt, you have just to find someone that fits with you and have similar needs.

It happens also that if you are too much focused on being ""available"" for your friends, therefore you become angry when they aren't available for you, so you become ""selfish"" in another way.

Do not worry, and please understand that it's not entirely up to you. You are only half responsible for the success of your friendship. Even if someone dislikes your ""friendship style"", only he doesn't fit with you. Look for someone that fits with you... At least to begin."

It’s very easy to get caught up in adolescence with your peers at parties but it just sounds like you’re not enjoying yourself there. Think about what you like. If you like music then go to places where music is prominent. If you spend most of your time reading, spend time in a library. If you are a die hard movie fanatic then go to movies. The real trick is not spending time looking for the girl. In most cases, if you’re obsessing over the idea of a relationship, you aren’t ready for one. Go out and enjoy the things you like and in doing that, you will undoubtedly find the girl you’re looking for. In my opinion, parties are pretty stupid especially when you’re main goal is finding a girl/guy. Parties will be enjoyed to their fullest if you commit yourself to body and mind, rally with your friends, and cause some fucking meyhem."
soc_531487,socialskills,reddit_comment,363,"Been there done that my guy. I swear everything you write, I could have written myself a year or two back. 
Nowadays I sing in my car on the way to school to warm up my voice lmao. I've had to cut down a bit on coffee as well because of the way it affected my voice. 
And on the talking to folks thing, I think you might be stressing giving an instant reply. I used to think that when talking to people, the quicker my reply was, the better. This way I spat out a lot of stupid things too, definitely making me sound retarded from time to time. Now I (try to) listen and reflect before saying anything. I often catch myself thinking about what my reply is going to be, instead of actively listening to what the other person is saying. This is a bad one. Stop this immediately. The quality of my interactions turned instantly better when I realised I was doing this. Listening is key. Don't freak out over a few seconds of silence. And just read your own writing here, you're not an idiot. No need to stress what you're going to say. I know that's way easier said than done, but everything comes with practice. I still struggle with this on the daily. 
I also think the harsh reality is that more often than not, people don't want to hear what you have to say, they just want to hear themselves speak. If you focus on listening good and understanding people, rather than giving a funny/clever reply, I think you will see some instant changes in your interactions.

You can also adapt your voice, it's tricky to explain but speak from the bottom of your lungs, not through your face if that makes any sense. It gives you a deeper voice and makes you sound more chill. 

As for the smiling to strangers thing, it becomes automatic after a short while. Again, just a polite, short smile every time you make eye contact. I'm running out of  english skills here but smiling is better than grinning if that makes sense (or at least so I think)"

soc_1235813,socialskills,reddit_comment,396,"Wow, I'm so glad you posted this because I feel exactly the same way you do. Only I wasn't brave enough to admit it on my own yet.

So first and foremost, thank you for creating a more comfortable and safe environment for me (and many others, I'm sure) to share.

This is not my first account, I've been on reddit for years and years, and I was always too afraid to post or comment. **I just couldn't get over the thought of a troll getting to me, or finding out that the majority of people legitimately disagree with me or dislike me.** In real life, we have much greater control over who we interact with. Don't like someone? Ignore them! Physically distance yourself from them! (I mean staying away and keeping them out of your life, not COVID style physical distance - thank you COVID for making this explanation necessary) But anyways, you can't do that online. Anyone can respond and they can say almost whatever they want.

*For someone who's always struggled with self-worth and self-esteem, all of that was just too much. It wasn't worth the risk, ever, to open up and share.*

**But the thing is, this was all actually my responsibility. My doing.** The reason any of that was terrifying is because I was subconsciously allowing the opinions of complete strangers (who may not even be saying what they truly think) hurt me. These are people that I will never know on a personal level. I probably won't even meet them once in my life.

*If I don't want to post, that's fine. But why am I allowing complete strangers to dictate whether or not I want to post?*

That's basically the conclusion I drew. And you'll see that while my account is about 3.5 years old and there was zero activity for at least the first three, it's got lots of comments and some posts since. **And I won't lie to you: there are and there will be assholes. But then there's really kind, compassionate, and wise people too. It's up to you who matters and who doesn't.** The truth is that no one ACTUALLY matters, and that's what gives you the freedom to decide for yourself.

So I applaud you and I welcome you, OP, to the beginning of something cool. I hope I'll see you around more :)"

Most probably, most people you meet already have a group or some friends back 'home'. For these people its not really interesting to go out and meet people to become new GOOD friends with. They already have and it is (somewhat!) exhausting to go through this process. Generally speaking.

If there are others out there having the same issues, most people are probably quite shy and not so socially active. You have to be socially pro active, to some extent, to endure this.

In both cases, you might indeed find why people not to seem to be interesting. The group person doesnt really have a desperate reason while you have. The loner person is hard to find. 

In the end, it is up to you (cliche). Why you got at this point is an crucial but also an independent matter.

You are still relatively young and you will definitely make one or more friends until your death, although I would advise you not to talk about your eventual life like that.

I know your current situation to the extent that you feel very lonely and empty right now and don't know whether you really need friends or should look for friends or whether you need a relationship.

In your message you talk about a lot of small problems and it is difficult to go into everything individually but i try my best  


1. &amp;#x200B;

It's your life and of course you have to decide for yourself if you want to have friends. We can't dictate anything to you. But having one or more friends will help you in every point of view. You can go out with friends and do something, you can meet them, play games or travel with them. You can talk to them, talk about such problems/thoughts and get their opinion. you can do so much

Of course there will also be arguments, a possible break or you might get injured, but that's all human.

2

Having a relationship can also improve/beautify your life in many ways. You have someone you trust very strongly, who loves you as you know it from films/series/books etc. Hugs or sex will give you a lot of feelings of happiness/moments that you probably haven't really known before or can imagine.

Of course, problems can also arise here, but they are human again.

So in short:

Having friends or having a girlfriend has so many advantages and it improves your life in every aspect.

The other problem you indirectly posed is how to get there.

For that I can recommend you the posts in the pinned post on the Reddit server or you can read my older messages on other posts that (almost) all had the same problem as one should/can friends."

2. This gentleman was fairly awkward, seemed immature and didn't have much to say outside of his jokes. Iow it depends on your social skills as well as how deep of a friendship you and your friends want. Basic (shallow) friendships are very common as most people just want to be acknowledged or someone to talk to and it's good from a business perspective. If they come to you just to feel better and you're ok with that than it works and everyone's happy. For deeper friends/friendships though it would stand out a bit later if not sooner.
3. While it's bad to base your worth off of others approval there's nothing wrong with shallow friendships. Whether you hide your personality or not it won't change the fact that you have your own qualities to offer"
soc_764115,socialskills,reddit_comment,486,"No one are going to think that you are creepy other then you. Since when you do something, and start think that you are creepy, in another universe there is the same you that do the same thing and everyone think that is so interest.

In other words, it depends on how you see yourself (remember the right mentality?). You can become a clown at some point, but it all depends from you if who is watching think that you are creepy or an interest person.

Anyway, they point here is to be influence as a person. This is the main problem that you need work on. Second, you need to have the knowledge to use this influence. I’ll post some example.

- “you are in a venue, and you hear people that are talking about painting, and maybe about a painter.” In this situation, you need the right influence to seems a genuine and open minded person, once this, you can ask them if they want to see a museum (here is why you need lot of knowledge).

- “people are talking about a film, and artist, or whatever argument.” You can enter the conversation without problem, and if you can read the situation, at some point you can ask for their numbers. (Yes, this sound like if you are searching for a girlfriend/boyfriend, but in fuct, no one know this).

Anyway, I’m doing this example also to make you clear that is not easy work like this. And the main problem is with mentality, and how you perceive yourself, or also the issue with society.

So I’m not sure this can help someone, but at least I hope you explain better the situation.

Honesty, strangers are the worst way to make new friend. This is most caused by the fact that friendship start with a justification. For example, at school you make friend because “we are all here to study, or so.” On a sport you make friends because “you have to make a team, or so.”

What I’m saying that friendship need always a justification to start. This is also why you need a lot of knowledge and personality to start a friendship with a strange. Since there are no justification to that, you have to create it. On the first example, it is when you said that you also like painting. This make a justification for you to talk, and to them to feel secure.

Anyway, justification is just the way friendship starts. Perhaps, friendship at some point lose any justification.

With all that said. The best way to start a friendship isn’t choosing the right venue, not choosing the right person. Venue is the key. For example, if you take a bus, there are no enough “justification” to start talking with the person sit on your right. But in a classroom there is enough. So the venue make always the difference."
soc_470369,socialskills,reddit_comment,221,"I definitely appreciate this viewpoint. I feel like I should have provided a little more context though. This girl isn’t a stranger to me. We’ve been friends for about three years and we run in the same friends circle. I’ve had an attraction to her since the day we met and I feel like she feels it as well, but it’s always remained unspoken. 

Also, she has an on/off boyfriend who treats her like human garbage. This isn’t just my opinion. Our mutual friends would be very quick to admit this fact as well. This was the main reason why I felt anonymous would be “safer” for her and myself to be honest. He has been known to fly off the handle in jealous fits of rage and I don’t want to put her in a bad situation if she decided to share the letter with him or if he found it or something. 

It’s not so much that I want to be with this girl, but more just let her know that she is loved and that she deserves better. I want her to know that despite her circumstances, she is beautiful and deserves the world. 

I realize that these details probably won’t change your stance much, but it makes me out to be less of a creep (I hope). "
soc_1800008,socialskills,reddit_comment,198,"Step 1: Get good at something. Be it Art, Music, Studies, Sports etc. That way you become interesting. It adds a layer to your personality.


Step 2: Learn when to say no and when to say yes. The more you lean into other's priorities than yours, the more they learn to trample over you.


Step 3:  Get into group activities. Be it volunteering,  sports, group discussions or any other activities that force you to interact with others.


Step 4 : Fashion sense is not just buying expensive clothes. There are tons of ways you can improve by just looking at magazines or just ask a friend who's got good fashion sense ( let it be someone you trust otherwise they might sabotage you).



Step 5: Talking to everyone.  Don't just go around taking to the people who you think are popular. Everyone is different and you can learn as much from others too. It also builds a positive attitude towards you.



That being said. In search of becoming someone you admire, don't go losing yourself.  Embrace what you are, learn which is the right crowd and which is not worth being around and cherish the little fun moments."

Now, given that she's asked you to hang before she obviously likes spending time with you. Whether it's as a friend or if she sees you as something more I cannot say as I am not in your position. 

Text her and see how she's doing and what her schedule is like. If you have a decent text conversation, it's time to ask her out.

Just tell her something like ""You know what, it's almost a crime that we haven't seen each other in so long. Let's go grab a drink this weekend and catch up."" 

And if she says yes, then that's fantastic. I'm sure the needing alcohol thing is just in your head, but catching up over a couple of beers is always nice. If she declines, well, you did say you are not afraid of rejection. So you have nothing to worry about.

Get on this!"
soc_1355447,socialskills,reddit_comment,266,"It's some great insight that I really agree with, but I would like to state my perosnal opinion. first things first, effort is a necessity to keep any kind of relationship alive. If someone stops putting in effort largely, not just one time, then obviously the other person would be hurt and the friendship/relationship bond might weaken. I totally agree that we should not assume when a person doesn't text, it is indeed dangerous and our assumptions are often incorrect. It's better to give them the benefit of the doubt. BUT, if this becomes a pattern, a regular ongoing thing that is happening, where the other person doesn't bother to give any kind of effort(meaning hanging out, talking, or anything at all) for long periods of time for a long while, then it becomes a problem. The other person might feel like they are holding all the weight of the relationship, and this is especially true when the person who's disappearing isn't very responsive. Unless told to, the person who's trying to keep the relationship alive can't truly assume what's going on. They won't be able to tell wether they hate them or maybe they're just busy for months on end. But at some point they're going to get tired of trying to keep a friendship/relationship on their own, especially if they truly care about the person and enjoy their company. They might even begin to worry about their well being. I find that it's easier if the unresponsive person tells then in advance what's going on, before stopping contact suddenly. But that's just my opinion."
soc_721852,socialskills,reddit_comment,660,"You remind me of my past self. I rarely spoke, from preschool all the way to middle school. Allow me to write you a mini-self help book on all
the tips that helped me the most:
 
 For one, I have to be honest here my guy- you’re never going to gain friends from rarely speaking. I know more than anyone that it’s a hard habit to break, and it’s scary to put yourself out there. But, there’s a sea of potential friends out there, and the only reason you haven’t caught a few is simply because they haven’t found you yet. I used to be near-mute in school as a kid, until I began forcing myself to branch out. I practically binged self-help books, improved my appearance and fashion sense (not at all important if you’re fine with how you look, it just helped me gain more confidence in myself), and surprise surprise- as I began to utilize their advice, my friend count grew exponentially. School is just a practice ground for social development- when you start applying for jobs, most look for charisma, social skills, and confidence in your abilities. It’s better to learn now than to suffer later in life, even though it’s a hard change that takes time, along with mental and physical effort. Here’s a rough summary of the advice that helped me the most:

 Start with interesting small talk. Not just things like, “Hey, did you do the math homework?”, more jokes and commentary on different things in class. People like to laugh, and when they associate you with laugher they’ll want to approach you. Being witty is definitely a trait you’ll have to work for if it doesn’t come naturally, but it pays off. 

 Another thing is to ask them about themselves. Most people absolutely love talking about themselves, either for vanity, or simply because they want to get something off their chest, or to express their inner thoughts and choices. Compliments go a long way- go for personal choices instead of physical attractiveness, though. If someone has dyed hair, I strike up a conversation with “Woah, your hair looks so cool! How did you get the color so vibrant?”. If someone’s wearing a graphic shirt from something I recognize, I go “Yo, you like ____ too?”, which is an instant winner usually- it immediately gives you both something to talk about and something in common. These all open up ways for them to talk about themselves, and let you get to know them better. You’ll make the person feel nice, and they’ll associate you with that positive feeling. And when the relationship develops further, you can begin to share things about yourself too (only if you’re comfortable with it though). 

 Body language is everything- if you cross your arms or look down all the time, it’s telling people that you’re closed off and insecure, and hard to communicate with. If you sit by yourself in a class instead of sitting with your peers, they’re going to continue letting you sit there instead of coming up to you and bothering someone who seems disinterested in others. If you do that, it might be another reason why others don’t approach you. Try to have open body language- uncrossed arms, a confident stance, eye contact, etc. all go a very long way. 

 This isn’t just going to happen overnight- it’ll be a gradual change, from finally having a good conversation with someone to having an entire friend group. It takes time and self-improvement, but by God it’s worth it. If all of this sounds too overwhelming or too drastic of a change from your personality, just simply smiling at people every day and saying “hello” is enough for someone to eventually start talking to you. Friendliness trumps all. Above all, your mental health and true personality are the most important- don’t lose yourself in trying to impress others. Godspeed, dude. You’ll find your friends one day."

BUT, you can change the way you play the game. People getting used to spicy food are still getting affected the same way, they just learn to tolerate it more. So just like spicy food, you need to be more exposed to experiences that will help you grow in your social skills, not experiences that will absolutely decimate you. It's gradual.

Only YOU know YOU the best, so the limits as to what you're exposed to are set by yourself. Everybody's uncomfortable about something. If they're not, they might either be really old or have a mental disorder (being completely serious)."

soc_924445,socialskills,reddit_comment,433,"Asking for contact info depends on the context and what level friendship you have. Everyone is different, but for me, my order is basically:

Snapchat = Anyone. SC is great for being a casual contact platform, because only *you* see who's on your friend list. You can skip stories of people you don't know too much, and if you want to get to know them better, sending a snap or starting a streak is pretty easy. I'll add basically anyone, from someone I just met at a bar, to someone on the internet. 

Instagram = Personal/Casual. I use IG like SC with a bit more reservation, as unlike SC, people can see who you follow, see posts you get tagged in, etc. I usually give IG to people who I've talked to in-person. So that does include someone I just met at a bar, but most likely not someone from the internet. IG is my main platform for when I meet mutual friends. 

Facebook = Personal. I only add people on FB if they're mutual friends or more. I don't use FB much anymore, but I usually wouldn't give it to people I just met.

Email = Business. I usually give my email if it's business related. There isn't much else to use it for nowadays.

Phone number = Personal/Business. If you have my number, you're either a close friend or family, or I gave it to you as a business contact. Unlike the other three listed, you *cannot* delete your own phone number (without going through a lot of trouble), so I usually try and not give it to people I don't know. And if I do, it's usually for something business related where I know they'll keep conversations professional. There's occasions where someone doesn't have social media at all, but most of the time, I try to give my social media before my number. 

Asking for contact info is pretty easy. You basically just say something along the lines of ""It was great meeting you, we should keep in touch!"" And they'll usually say yes, and then either ask for *your* contact info (and you can ask your preferred choice, like ""Of course, do you have Instagram?"") or you can just say ""What""s the best place to reach you?""

If it's someone you've known for a bit, just bring it up next time you see them and say ""Hey, I don't think I have your contact info yet"" and they should give it to you. Sorry for the long post lol, but it's really simple and nothing you should worry about."

Gettin mad at someone for bein ill, trashin the tools they use to try and be well as dumb and unecessary just cuz YOU ain't need em and YOU don't understand it, and usin that as an excuse to twist the knife in some other area they struggle with? That's some petty, self-absorbed, mean-spirited, DEFINITIONALLY abusive ass BS! Oh, and ain't shit even a little bit ""subtle"" ABOUT that lol!

Second off tho? Here's the flip side. I don't know your dad or your relationship. Maybe he IS just a fucking abusive DICK n ur mom just been livin with it for so long she fallin into that pattern that's so easy to of always making excuses for, justifying, and defending him. That's totes a possibility.

However, there is another. Maybe he's not. Maybe its not coming from a place of malice or narcissism but merely one of being a lil self-involved and/or ignorant of the topic at hand... and frustrated with his child struggling so much cuz its tough when ppl you love are hurting in ways you don't understand and can't help with. Maybe your mom's not bein a stockholme victim so much as... maybe she does know more than you do. Maybe she's spent those nights with him crying and feeling powerless, wishing you could just pull yourself up by the bootstraps and BE OKAY or at least that anything he had in HIS tool belt of what to do or say was more useful/helpful to you. Maybe she's telling you that's not what he meant because its not, and she's not gonna out him on some stuff she knows he's not comfy being vulnerable enough to reveal to you directly but she also doesn't want her child to feel belittled by her husband when she knows he just handled himself poorly out of his OWN feelings.

I've struggled with depression all my life, I DO actually get it, and I've STILL found that it can be REALLY hard when ppl I loved and in particular was living with were in the heart of it. I still felt powerless, I still got frustrated, I still took it personal sometimes, I still responded poorly sometimes. And therapy/psychiatry/allathat? Again, I don't know your family, but its still a relatively new and niche and VERY western and modern value. I was born in the US but most of my family wasn't and still has a lot of old-world values that DON'T include understanding or truly seeing the value of or respecting things like psych meds. And sometimes they say hurtful things out of ignorance and different cultural values more than anything and they're not who I tend to talk to about that sort of thing as a result... but I try to keep in mind where its coming from and not take it as an attack. Again, I don't know your family, but it is A thing... up to you to determine whether its whats happening in ur sitch.

TLDR? 100% that is an abusive response/behavior, you ARE NOT wrong about that... but it may be just that, a really bad specific ACTION. And maybe it doesn't mean he feels the way it understandably sounds and feels like it does, maybe its just coming from a place of hurt and frustration and lack of understanding."

Interest and pleasant is relative to friend groups. There's a difference between style/subculture conflicts and genuinely unpleasant. One way to know is to branch out and keep learning how different people interact. Then you can judge if you're being inappropriate vs. your old friends actually don't click well with you.   


I used to think I was super uninteresting, but I moved out of my homogenous small city to a diverse big city, and discovered I'm somewhat charming, I just have a lot of little awkward tendencies that most people here don't care about thankfully.

soc_138530,socialskills,reddit_comment,371,"I'm also a 3rd year and 20 years old and I had a similar problem last year.  I was never big on partying.  I valued sleep over creating noise and vomiting etc (most college parties, really).  As you can already tell I am quite the introverted person.  For a while I didn't care about what my neighbors thought of me (they thought I was a weenie for not getting shit faced Thursday - Sunday).  I can't really be much help on the partying aspect, but I can say that I have never been to one, and I really think I made the right choice.  Sure, I felt that I was missing something, but it wasn't partying.  It's college, don't feel like you need to obey society's skewed standard on college life.  There's nothing wrong with not going to parties, it's not the end of the world.  You can do whatever the hell you want, assuming you live by yourself.  It's your call.  

As for having friends, I would stick to people within your major.  You and your peers share the same passion and will probably have similar interests.  Along with peers, women in a similar major will probably be a good choice too since you can talk about professors or homework or tests.  These are all things that will help break the ice and allow for some deeper connections to form.  

That being said, I want to emphasize that this isn't a tried and true thing.  It's what worked for me, except the girlfriend thing.  My girlfriend is a business major, but we share similar interests outside of school which is also possible.  

Friends don't need to be in the same major, but it's a lot easier to connect with people who share the same majors or similar majors.  You all will have difficulties to relate to as well as stories and more that will make it easier to connect.  

I'm rambling I know, but I thought I should help someone who is in the same position I was last year.  Let me know if you need any clarification.  It's finals week for me so I'm tired and my writing turns into shit quite quickly.  I hope this helps a little "

Personally, my PERSONAL PREFERENCE, since ppl don’t seem to understand in some of these comments, is to not be approached by strangers, even in broad daylight w ppl around. I just personally don’t like it. I think most people would be ok with it as long as the person isn’t completely weird about it.

Imo, it’s best if they give their personal info rather than asking for yours after you have a little conversation. “I’ll let you get running, but here’s my number, let me know if you’d like to have coffee sometime” is the perfect way to say it tbh, it would make me feel less creeped out/awkward and more flattered.

soc_1354364,socialskills,reddit_comment,170,"I think nothing of it. It’s hard to meet people and it’s easy to grow out of the relationships we forged in our school days. It really just matters how they deal with it as we get closer. Will they become overly clingy, try to monopolize your social life, or tag along to every outing with your friends uninvited, is their mother their crutch for lack of a social circle? Those are things to consider and address early on but typically, I don’t think those are prominent things to arise. 

Being on the other side of it, just remember that it is not your partner’s fault if they are all you have. Don’t resent them for having a social life, it doesn’t mean they care any less, it just means they have to work harder to balance their relationships and you need to be accommodating to that or else you come off as manipulative or controlling.

&gt;How the fuck is that not rude? I wouldn't even say this person is much of a ""friend"" at this point either. Friendships aren't one way streets.

I absolutely agree, the person is being rude and i'm not trying to advocate that OP just sits back and takes it.  Certainly not, that won't help anything.

&gt;No, fuck that, if OP wants change, he/she has to address it. Thinking that it's only OP that is due to his friends not listening and even cutting him/her off is naive.

Again, i apologize that you've inferred that the blame is on OP entirely,  i believe that the other party is the guilty one.  However we also don't know if OP is bringing this on themselves a bit (with their reactions/body language) or if OP just has some pretty bad taste in friends.  We really can't say anything definitively, but his ""friends"" do sound like asses. 

&gt;Maybe two wrongs don't make a right, but OP isn't going to get any improvement if he stays in fear of upsetting his ""friends"".

Here's where I both agree and disagree.  I really believe that OPs ""friend"" is being totally rude (and selfish).  However I dont think he/she should fight rude with rude.  When you call people out on their personality flaws (valid, though they may be), the majority of people will take offense and rather than apologize, become defensive.  Especially in a situation where you are coming off as rude.  Does the other party deserve OP calling them out? Yeah likely...  However I believe its in OPs best interest to tread carefully.  If she/he confronts someone on being rude and they respond apologetically and sincerely sorry, I have to imagine OP will feel kind of bad for being so confrontational.  My suggestion would be for OP to be careful as he tells people he feels like he's not being listened to.  I think he should bring it up, but test the waters light-heartedly before going full ""fight fire with fire"", that's all."

I hope I didn't make you uncomfortable, but if I did, I want to know - just want to make sure everything's okay and, if it's not, what I can do to fix things. I like you as a friend, and want to make sure you feel okay working and chatting with me still.

In my experience in these kinds of situations, she'd open up, we'd have a heart to heart, and that would deepen the friendship and we'd be cool from there.

So, it's not about her owing you anything, it's just you showing sympathy and wanting to make sure she still feels comfortable with you and, if not, you're conveying that you care about the friendship and professional relationship.

But, that's kind of specific to my personality. I guess, in the end, follow your gut and be sincere, also try to show empathy, sympathy, and convey that you're not taking it too seriously - Hope this helps!"
soc_1392526,socialskills,reddit_comment,557,"In terms of skateboarding career I'll say right now that that is what ever you want it to be. Stay in school is still the best advice I should have taken. But better advice would be to break down what it is that we do.

It's a solo sport. You are self motivated. That already shows commitment. I live in the UK, so we have endless bad weather and I know how you feel. I joined a gym recently and would have not done that at your age but my motivation now is that I want to skate for as long as I can before I'm too old to kickflip. 
I go to the gym for my mental health and fitness towards skateboarding. The gym is still a solo sport if you think about the same way as skating which broke down a barrier for me of it not being as interesting as skating itself. (watch the workout videos by pro skater Neen Williams he's a lovely bloke and amazing at heel flips)
Basically my advice is (and you apply this everywhere) is to change your perspective on everything. This is hard to do and it will take a great deal of conscious thought and time but you can break all of your frustrations down by giving yourself time to think.

Like if I were to say to you join a gym for the soul purpose of the betterment of yourself would you do it? (and for the love of god don't drink insane amounts, do drugs or get in with the wrong crowd)

Some other advice I heard once years ago was that the excercise you do in the gym that you hate the most, is probably the excercise you should be doing the most. Is usually because that's your weakest point and it needs work. Honesty some times is hard but you gotta absolutely work on that to. Start with being honest with yourself first and foremost. Respect yourself enough to say I don't want this or I need this for my wellbeing right now. (I'm not saying don't go drinking everytime the boys are going out you're allowed your cheat days) but as long as your operating at a good standard 80 percent of the time is better than 30 percent of the time. 100 percent is utopian and completely unobtainable in every aspect of your life so don't go for 100 percent it will only lead to depression. Allow things to be bad, use them as learning experiences and live your life at 80ish percent.

As for the career in skateboarding. That's absolutely up to you to figure out. Who knows. You might sustain an injury that fails your dreams of a dew tour career and you may take up art instead and become the graphic designer for a business that prints skateboards? That still sounds like a good career in skateboarding. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

(music, filming, photography, video/photo editing, skateboarding is creative and so are these fields of professional content creation. All have the same levels of self fulfilment you talk of and I do all of these things in my spare time.) 

I wish you the best of luck woodpusher. You got this.

And respect the scooter kids. They have the same troubles as you do."
soc_177160,socialskills,reddit_comment,413,"People talk behind other people's backs. It's true. Still, it's important to know that when someone is talking behind your back, usually, they're doing it to process their own feelings about an interaction. People say all of the things they say, and then move on. The people who are on the receiving end of the gossip may form impressions about you based on that gossip, but their impressions of you aren't set in stone. Likewise, unless you've irreparably offended the person who is gossiping about you, that person's impressions of you likely aren't set in stone, either. Once they've finished processing their feelings aloud, they move on. I'm working on my nervousness about people talking behind my back, too. It helps to remember, though, that people spend very little time talking about you (unless you happen to be their ex during a bad break-up,) and that, as I said above, once people have said what they need to say, they move on. 

Yes, reputation does matter, but it only goes so far as your own behavior confirms (or appears to confirm) your reputation.

If your coworkers think you are antisocial, start reversing that impression by smiling, appearing open, and practicing confident and self-assured body language whenever you run into them. That's a small goal, but it will make you appear more friendly and approachable. 

From there, convincing people you're likable is just making sure that they have pleasant experiences whenever they see and/or talk to you. It's like getting a new puppy to warm up to you. When the puppy realizes that good things happen around you, the puppy warms up. When people realize that they feel pleasant when they run into you, they, too, will warm up. 

The accumulation of positive, low-risk experiences that are associated with you is called ""building rapport,"" and it doesn't matter how small each experience is, or how slowly you go. In fact, many people appreciate quiet but pleasant people and seek solace in them, so it's okay if you're still the ""quiet one,"" and it's okay if you only come out of your shell in one-on-one situations. You can still establish yourself as friendly without becoming the person who knows how to work an entire room.

TLDR: Relax. Reputations are impermanent, and in reality, people are rarely talking about you. Practice smiling, practice making people feel at ease and happy around you. You can do it.

I wish you the best, and I hope this helps!"
soc_28462,socialskills,reddit_comment,729,"It was one of those mind-blowing, matrix-like moments when I first realized what club ""dancing"" was all about.

Let me put it this way: your grandparents were right to be worried about Elvis and his hips. The old cliche really is true, that a girl is imagining sex when she dances (grinds) with you. **This is basically a girl's ""get out of slut free"" card.** She can have a guy pound her doggy-style on the dance floor, and then go home and still feel like a classy lady.

It is absolutely, 100%, completely and utterly ridiculous... but you must accept this fact. All those logical, normal-world thoughts on what is inappropriate? Get them out of your head when you are on that dance floor. Your goal is out there is to progress from foreplay, to just about full blown-sex, all without speaking a word, and of course while fully clothed. AND to the rhythm of the song.

Start with hands on the waist. Sway back and forth with the beat, making sure to sway her with you. Now comes the foreplay. You need to focus on the girl's body, and how she reacts to you. Can you pull away slightly, and she follows you? Grip your fingers around her hip-bones, and use them to guide her, with the beat.

*Part of foreplay is a push-pull.* So don't be afraid to take some space. Then pull her up close, rub your hip into her pelvis. With the beat. Pull away slightly, notice she might come back after you, and at that point SHE is the one quite literally grinding her clitoris into your hip or leg. Try putting a hand on the small of her back, *beneath* her shirt. You can even slide your fingers underneath her waist band. Unless she is really drunk / slutty, you won't be able to go all the way down to the clitoris or butt-crack, but you can get shockingly close on a ""classy"" girl.

If she turns her back on you, just let her do the work. Chances are, she will do the ""booty clap"", aka pretending to get fucked doggy-style. Girls love this shit. I can never take it seriously. If she doesn't go for that (yet), use the back-turned opportunity to get up close to her. Put your face beside hers, and smell her hair. Move your hands around to her stomach. 

The point is, girls want to feel sexy on the dance floor. The key part of that is SEX. You quite literally want to try and make the girl wet. If you get an erection, don't fight it. The girl wants to feel it. It lets her know she is sexy. All of this is creepy as fuck, but it's true. You will get compliments about how ""great of a dancer you are"" from this kind of creepy shit.

After a song or two, chances are the girl will move on to the next guy. Don't chase her. You are the dance-floor equivalent to a ONS. I wouldn't be very interested in talking to a girl, just because she danced with me. The whole thing is a bit hard for me to get over--it seems slutty--which is a turnoff for me. On the other hand, if you have been on a few dates with a girl, dancing is a sure-fire way to escalate things physically, where she will want to go home and have sex with you. Take the whole thing for what it is, and use it for what your version of good or for evil. Your choice.

*Warning:*

There are many girls who go dancing, who may have a BF, and really do ""just like to dance"". These girls will dance with you, but they will NOT grind with you! They might do things that are, lets say, inappropriate for a GF to do in a normal setting, but there is some invisible line which they will not cross. So always test the waters first. Push/pull is the key. Don't just go up and force yourself on a girl. ""Push"" things a little bit, then back off. If she ""pulls"" to you (and escalates a little further), then push a bit more, and so on. A girl will know her own limits and will make it clear via body language if she feels things are becoming inappropriate."

Anyways- he definitely sounds like he has controlling/abusive tendencies. Whether you like him is up to you just be aware...

As a girl who likes dangerous men- I think he sounds a little sexually rough. The girl you're talking about might not know how to pump the brakes or he doesn't listen when she does.

You would have to figure that out before you try to kiss him. 
-If the problems just her: I would suggest you just say ""I want to see how good you kiss"". It immediately puts you in control of the situation, and you can tell him to stop when you're ready. MOST DECENT MEN AREN'T GOING TO KEEP KISSING YOU WHEN YOU TELL THEM TO STOP.

If he's the type that doesn't respect ANY girl's boundaries- don't kiss him and give up on it.

soc_745426,socialskills,reddit_comment,318,"It really depends on the person you are dating as well as how long you two have been dating. For example, my boyfriend has been my best friend since we were 14 however we recently just started dating so obviously we know each other in &amp; out but conversation is natural between us. We are comfortable joking, having deep talks, having serious talks and we are able to read each other to see what kind of mood we are in. If he had a long day at work or school, we will probably put on a movie and relax. It is completely comfortable since we know each other so well but I understand that isn’t always the case.

With my ex-boyfriend (knew each other few months before dating) he was very quiet and kind of introverted. At first I assumed I was boring him or he didn’t want to get to know me on a deeper level. So I would get frustrated with him sometimes because he wasn’t as talkative as I am. We would do activities together that brought him into his element, go out to eat (but still wouldn’t carry conservation as we ate), hangout with mutual friends or watch movies together. This relationship didn’t last because we were just too different and I knew we would both be better off with other people. Our humour was also different. 

I can only advise based on my experience but I think it comes down to compatibility and just knowing the person so well that you can be yourself authentically around them. Relationships are suppose to fun, remember that! If someone doesn’t understand you or vibe with you then maybe it isn’t the right relationship. However if you do love them but you genuinely do not know what to talk about then you will need to find commonalities and activities you guys can talk and bond about together."

soc_1322041,socialskills,reddit_comment,272,"His Instagram *only* has 200 followers.

They are your words. The word *only* suggests that’s not enough by your standards/expectations, or your peers’. Which then suggests that you may indeed be concerned about popularity. But we won’t get caught up on words, no need for nit picking.

To give my 2 pence, you’re not strange for stalking his Instagram- who doesn’t? As you say, it can give us an idea of another person’s values - that’s why employers do social media vetting after all. I’m in England too, and never add loads if random people on social media (inc LinkedIn). That’s personal choice. I (mostly) only have people I know in person on my social media accounts - I don’t have a need to add anyone else. So whilst someone could get a general idea about me via social media, it isn’t a true reflection of who I am. For example, someone who looks on my IG won’t see many updates, so may think I’m an inactive/boring person. But they don’t know that I’ve done xyz this month - purely because I don’t think to take pictures/post stories about everything. 

So whilst you can get a *general* idea of his personality through social media, it won’t be an accurate reflection of who he is. Adding you on LinkedIn doesn’t mean he’s interested, but it might do, because he’s made a small effort to connect with you individually. I’d say that if you like him, try to get closer e.g become friends. Or ask him out? What’s the worst that can happen? Rejection is painful but you have the pride in trying 😘"

Girls sometimes do selfies, guys usually show a pic of what they are doing and have the message say streak. It all depends on the person, if you're handsome, send selfies, all up to you. Streaks are also a way to increase your snap score. If you swipe down from the camera you can see it. Snap score is basically like Reddit karma. It's like a status. I have a score of 14k that's rookie. If you have like 1k and have it for a while people can see that you don't really interact with people or snap/recieve.

I got to university and I continued that I made 0 friends for the past 5 years.

I think you will be nicer. Also, instead of offering your complete homework to be copied just help them with a question or two. This shows your involved. But again do it if asked from you.  

Overly helpful people will end up being used because if you offer then the other will say yes but they have no obligation to reciprocate because they never asked you to do it you just did out of free will. But you are thinking you do so much and don't get anything in return. On the other hand if they approach you for homework and you say yes then you are the nice guy because then it becomes sought of a favour to them; they were in need and you helped them. 

You can offer a few times or to a close friend but don't offer excessively.  

About the advice part...you can simply say ""I don't know what to say to you, seems like it is your decision, I am sure you will do the right thing"". That is if you blowing them off.

Honestly, as a person who has never meet you across the internet, you come off as a whiny me me me person. The entire block of text above feels like it was written by a high school student.

You say you're not confrontational, but immediately after that you say that you'll stick up for yourself. With how you write the rest of your post, I'd say you may wish to reexamine how you find yourself to be not confrontational- perhaps there is area for personal growth here.

 

So a few things: with your coworkers being petty about where you used to work, either ignoring it or embracing it is the way to go. When I say embracing, I mean accepting that you did it with no more emotion for or against- as if you were talking about a job as a cashier at a supermarket. It was something you did once upon a time, and that part of your life is over. 

As a paramedic, do others have the same problem with forgetting that you do? If they don't then you may need to find a way to up your game- in your position, forgetting may have serious consequences. Also, if the nurses aren't trying to be your enemies, why provoke it? Reach out to them if you can and try to build something there.

Without more details of your family or your bff, all I can say is that if they don't want to talk to you, take a few years off, learn how to let things go, and accept that the possibility exists that you may not be able to patch things up. With that mindset, then go in and attempt to reach out to them.

If your friends are bailing on you all the time, find new friends. It may not be easy, but instead of scheduling time when your friends bail on you, find something else to do.

Overall, you really seem like an aggressive person who needs to be right all the time. You laugh off your personal faults and focus on others with a focus that speaks of a need to prove yourself in the eyes of others. You also seem a bit two-faced, specifically in where you say that nurses are arrogant and disrespectful but everyone deserves a chance. Which one is it? 

Try looking at it from the other side of the table- if someone came up to you and started doing what you did to them, how would you respond?

Finally, seriously consider talking to a counselor or a psychologist. If you have had all of those things happen to you in your life already, you may want some help sorting it all out and trying to get your life back on track socially."

soc_690790,socialskills,reddit_comment,418,"Well first of all it's inevitable that you will compare yourself to whoever you see. Otherwise how do you know the reality that something is wrong with you? Your brain is hardwired to compare yourself to everyone you come in contact with, and immediately makes a snap judgement about whether this is someone you can compare yourself to (and therefore motivate you), or someone who is too far beyond you (and therefore demotivate you to even try), which makes sense, because in life you shouldn't waste your time becoming something you can't, but you absolutely SHOULD spend your time to become someone you want to and CAN be. So when you compare yourself to someone who is better than you in a way that you desire, learn from them! Whether by asking or watching, that's what comparing yourself is for.

Following that, the reason why comparing yourself makes you feel bad all the time is because everyone else is SO FAR ahead of you in everything that you desire, such as attractiveness, fitness, better grades, hobbies they're passionate about. So what can you do about it? Well if you're so far below everyone else and you're worthless in absolutely every respect then there's only one person you can compare yourself to: who you were yesterday. And try to avoid seeing all those people who are so far beyond you in areas you can't reach because of course you have to compare yourself to them, which will demotivate you and cloud you from the truth that you CAN be better.

So the answer is BE more attractive than the person you were yesterday. Do more work than the person you were yesterday. Eat better, be cleaner, be fitter, than the person you were yesterday. And every moment you do something to be slightly less useless than before congratulate yourself because that's the beginning of an infinitely compounding effect that will conclude one day to someone beyond your wildest dreams. I'm sick of people who say you are a valuable and good person even if in truth you are likely vengeful and lazy and jealous and ignorant and you are worse than everyone else is in every possible way imaginable. It's an empty platitude that doesn't help and is actually harmful because feeling good about having nothing is NOT good. And your self-esteem is BEGGING you to wake up and do something real about it. It's pathological, comparing is inevitable, and it's up to you to do something about it."

My bet your issue is, you probably need to stand up for yourself. I was the “quiet one” “nice guy “ always said polite things. People treated me as an idiot too especially when I deliberately let them walk over me. 

Then, one day, I got annoyed and starting speaking up and calling folks out on their bullshit. They were surprised. Multiple people said when I spoke back, I made them feel stupid and it made them not want to speak around me. Lol. Haha take that!

So chances are, you’re probably super smart; smarter than average person and they can’t relate to you. So Solution: Start responding back to their jokes with sarcasm and witty remarks. If you don’t know any, hire a coach or therapist to help you out. 
For example, with the soda comment, you can reply back, “no shit Sherlock, I’m not like you who thought the cap was there for decoration” ;)

After a few comments like that, they’ll stop making degrading comments yo you. They may even respect you more OR laugh and then you can be the “star” of the party/event. Everyone loves a good jokester!

Lastly, I don’t believe in ADHD. I believe that’s society trying to put people in boxes where they don’t belong. A fish will spend it’s whole life thinking it’s stupid if you judge it on his ability to climb a tree. You dear, are not stupid. People are putting you in the wrong box. It’s up to you to find out which box (if any) you belong and play there :-)

If you think you're 'on the spectrum', what do others there like? Math? Board games? You'd have a better idea than I would :o).

Now, a quick comment on your original post: it is a *lot* easier to get all wrapped up in our own thoughts, feelings and emotions and to think the worst. Don't let that stop you from using each conversation moment as an opportunity for interpersonal growth. "
soc_372211,socialskills,reddit_comment,147,"First, introversion is not the same as shyness.  Plenty of introverts enjoy social situations, meeting new people, etc. 

The feelings of shyness are not a choice, in my experience. However, your actions are your choice. Even when feeling shy, one can choose to move forward, put themselves out there,  and interact with people.  So shyness is not a cop out.   (Severe social anxiety is a separate thing, though, and if that’s the case seek help.) 

We live in a culture that encourages and rewards outgoing, extrovert-like behavior.  (Even though studies have shown that people left to work alone produce better results.)   I’d love to have that change, but in order to make any changes, the introverts are gonna have to get out there and help make it happen! (Even if that means that the network with extroverts who are willing to listen and spread the word. ) "
soc_1224087,socialskills,reddit_comment,114,"You don't have to think like this, if the conversation didn't continue, so that's just it, it's not your fault or driver's fault. 

Don't push yourself to say the best thing to keep conversation going, it doesn't work, it makes it worse. Just calm down, say whatever comes to your mind or not, it's your choice. 

I always rather be quiet than talk to kill the silence. I was like you, trying to push myself to be that fun guy. But no, that's not even who I am, I am fun too, but in my own way. 

It all depends on your mood and the person who you talk to. So don't worry. Relax."
soc_67460,socialskills,reddit_comment,155,"The group fears change because it can upset the status quo, and its presence may be a reflection of their flaws. Therefore, to cut the snake's head off, maintain the status quo and do not make your change a reflection of their flaws.

**Example:** Video game group where you just happen to be in a fitness phase and bringing healthy snacks to the group.

Don't play less, and make the healthy snacks about YOU and not them. I repeat: don't play less, and don't juxtapose the morality of your decision against theirs.

**The wrong way:** ""Hey guys, I brought this celery and peanut butter because I figured WE could eat better, amirite?""

**A more tactful way:** ""Yeah, I know it isn't cheetos and M&amp;Ms...but seriously, you guys need to try these caschew-pumpkin seed clusters. Steady energy for long raids, amirite?""

Keep on inviting that person every now and then, invite a few more people that you'd think will be compatible with your group of friends and just keep going from there. 

I personally have plenty of groups of friends that I can join at any time. Because I built friendships to last. Being freinds with someone does take hard work, and you have to put the effort in yourself, just ask em to hang out. A phonecall or text message won't scare em away."

If you can't find an opening where she's not wearing them, feel free to give he a beaming smile, and say something to her, or mime taking the headphones off.

Just because she's an introvert, and just because she likes music, doesn't mean that she wouldn't appreciate Prince Charming sweeping her off her feet. Or a nice compliment from an admirer.

The smoke drifts, so while you are smoking, you can assume that a large area around you smells bad.  After you leave, the area still smells bad.  And whether you know it or not, *you* smell bad, even when you aren't actively smoking. ""Some offense intended.""  Think of that picture of Pigpen from the Peanuts cartoon.  That's about the size of the area around a smoker where I can notice the smell.  

This is not about ""how to not give a fuck"".  Like it or not, there are some people who are not giving you a chance, because of the smoking.  The smoking is limiting your possibilities.  It's nothing personal about you - it's just that for people who are sensitive to it, the smell is so overwhelmingly offensive.  It's your choice, but I would ask you to consider stopping a habit that is, in So many ways, bad for you.

soc_617644,socialskills,reddit_comment,211,"I know where you are coming from. See how you just typed up this entire thing? See how you already have so much to say? It’s clear you have a lot to share and furthermore, there is no such thing as a set way or protocol that people that have conversations go about it. Everyone is just winging it at the end of the day, but some people do have less anxiety about it than others. It may be more difficult to share these things you’ve written in person face-to-face with another human being and I understand. This is coming from anxiety as well. Anxiety is a lifelong battle and I’ve personally found it unproductive to think that I’ve “conquered it” or “gotten rid of it” completely. Rather I like to frame it on a case by case basis and acknowledge specific instances where I can tell I am getting anxious and anxiety is affecting me. There is no shame in anxiety. Everyone feels it and some in more scenarios than others. The key however is to acknowledge it, admit it and continue on. You can look into things like CBT and meditation too, both of which have many positive results in scientific literature. Just my two cents hopefully it helps."
soc_1624465,socialskills,reddit_comment,568,"First off bro don’t feel ashamed about it, it takes time and yeah finding that courage is a pain. Just a week ago I asked one of my coworkers out, with the help of one of my buddies who was playing cupid between us because we work different shifts, but he was able to gather enough to find out we both had feelings for one another for so long and that she was waiting for me to make the first move aka ask her out. My boy literally baited me and set a trap that I could not get out of to text her and when I say my anxiety was through the roof.. it took me like 3 hours to finally hit send on that text (also have had her number for a long time but mainly was just texting for work or dorky meme sharing) and some liquid courage lol. But we texted for hours that night and eventually got my first ever date a few nights ago. I am a huge introvert and have just a slight bit of social anxiety so definitely was nervous wreck at the beginning but after a few drinks and some chatting i let myself go and just enjoyed her company and had good laughs and convo. Literally just texted her a few mins ago for a 2nd date which of course wasn’t easy but was able to push myself to do it because i do like her a lot. My advice for you my man, don’t force yourself out of your comfort zone but also work on finding that courage it definitely took me awhile and also some help from friends lol. It takes time but you’ll find your person bro, if anything practice developing questions to ask, definitely try to avoid simple yes/no questions, as I do struggle with conversation and keep it going but will let loose and talk nonstop the more i like a person i guess? But yeah bro, there is some out there for you definitely, just gotta find them and reel them in. I think my biggest issue other than finding courage was getting over that fear of rejection, thanks to my boy he kept pounding it in my head every single day until i asked her out, “the worst she can say is no, you ain’t dying man, you win some and lose some just move on to the next”, and when that courage finally pops out be ready cause it’ll hit you hard like a train, definitely did for me lol. Stay positive my dude, don’t be ashamed, and just remember a simple “hello how are you? Or what’s up?” goes a LONG way. Also it’s up to you to admit or not that you’ve never dated/had a gf but I told my date that she was the first I’ve ever asked out and she thought it was cute and was very honored lol. Again just get over that fear of rejection and practice the words you wanna say to ask her out, it’s hard but you’ll get it man, that courage will find you soon. So keep your head up man, it’ll happen I guarantee it. If my lame ass was able to do it then you can too my guy :) also don’t stress too much where to go on dates, you tend to find eachothers likes and dislikes."
soc_1659991,socialskills,reddit_comment,157,"As friends you shouldn't feel bad, that you are wasting their time. That's on them. People can choose anyway to spend their free and if its with you, you should feel happy. Now I think, you feel the need to have to make up some reason as to why you would go out, so as it to seem that you are doing something. That not necessarily a bad thing but you shouldn't feel pressured about it as well. Sometimes friends just wanna hangout, talk, share stories and ask questions and those are perfectly valid reasons to be with your friends. 

Just accept things as is. By all means, it is your decision to be with them or not but dont leave a friend hanging for too long. It might be easier for you if you can combine it with some activities, like the film making, sports, various other hobbies that you can do together and so on."
soc_1256165,socialskills,reddit_comment,204,"To make actual friends, you need to have a shared interest. That's probably the best way to make new connections, like sharing a hobby or liking the same food and simple stuff like that. This allows you to expand on the conversation and get to know each other. Someone isn't just going to magically appear right in front of you and ask you to be friends with them. You need to invest time into looking for friends and make sure to stay engaged. 

Personally, I don't think being on social media will do you any benefit expect make you feel worse. You really can't gain anything from there except make new friends that probably don't care about you and only focus on their number of followers and stuff. You should focus on the people that's around you, like co-workers, family, neighbors. Maybe look for groups to join that share a hobby.

This is just my opinion, but people who watch anime are probably the easiest people to befriend. You just got to talk about anime and watch it, and they'll talk to you nonstop. I know this from experience because I'm an anime lover myself, and I love it when people talk about anime."
soc_162510,socialskills,reddit_comment,275,"They always say never talk about religion or politics on a date (or the first date, at least). I agree to an extent, because some people can get really fired up about these topics.

It's hard when you're on the opposite end from the other person, especially if you have friends similar to you. For example, I'm an Atheist and have Atheist friends. I sometimes forget that I am in the company of my Christian friends and may say something that would be better received by my Atheist friends. 

However, my mom is also a Christian (although a very ""liberal"" one) and we fight from time to time on the topic. Mainly because she feels like that's the only place she has failed in raising me, and I don't think she failed there because I made my own choices. 

I don't specifically seek out Atheist friends. When I do find them, we have something in common and I don't have to censor my thoughts as I would with a Christian friend. I think you should consider the pros/cons to a friendship/relationship with someone that has different views. It really depends on the person. If they're trying to shove religion down your throat or praying for your soul, it's probably not a healthy relationship or friendship. If they're just doing their thing and OK with you doing your thing, it will probably be a great friendship. 

Try to be respectful -- which can be hard, (I'm trying to change how I treat others' religions, so I know firsthand lol) -- but don't let them try to ""convert"" you or talk down to you for not believing. "
soc_152039,socialskills,reddit_comment,322,"Who says you need to have sex or sexual desires? For sure I'm sure, that you have some need for something else in life. Example, you may be more passionate and prefer to love rather to lust. It's up to you! Don't let society choose what you want to do with your life.

Secondly, get clothes you think would look good on you from your perspective. Worry about how it changes your look afterwards. Then, accept it. That's what I do. I get skinny jeans because I love the way they look on me.

You are an individual. Do whatever YOU like because that means that is you. If you don't like wearing makeup, don't. It's better to associate with people who like being with you because of YOU and not because of the YOU you try to be. Just go with the flow.

I tend to over-think things alot too. You seem like a cool person to hang out with, possibly smoke (? or not ?) and just talk about life, under the night starry sky, because as you say, you ask questions, and a ton of questions is a great way to have a great night of conversation, and maybe drinks! (And yet, I only do drinks because others also do, drinks are not required, replace drinks with board games if needed!!)

You see, this post reminds me that I am trying new things and am not really liking what I am doing as much as I should. You say you don't know who you are, well, the obvious answer to that is you should find out who you are then! Try new things, until you find the things that match up with you and wavelength. 

Try new hobbies, try new music, etc. Think of these questions:

What are your hobbies/interests?
What is your favorite type of music/favorite artist?
What is your passion in life?
What do you do (work/study)?"
soc_224344,socialskills,reddit_comment,300,"Online dating is pretty interesting. Maybe you've seen that [Tinder experiment on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY8rzo4Ik4M) where an attractive male and an attractive female both sign up for Tinder? The results were the girl got 160% more matches than the guy, and the girl got 1250% more messages than the guy. Check out the video for yourself if you'd like. 

Anyways, is online dating a waste of time for males? Well the data from the Tinder experiment certainly shows us the statistical disparity that exists between genders. However, whether online dating is a waste of time is entirely up to you. Like for example, if after all your failed attempts to land a date but you still manage to get one date, then perhaps you'd consider that a complete success! So in that way it wouldn't have been a waste of time. 

As a male, put yourself in the female's ""shoes"". As we see from the Tinder experiment video, a female will receive WAY more matches and messages than their male counterparts. Imagine waking up everyday and having your inbox slammed with 500+ messages (just a theoretical number), all a bunch of (presumably) males trying to secure their chance to get a date. That's pretty overwhelming. These 500+ messages could be anything from dick pics, to cheesy pick-up lines, to phone numbers, or anything. That's a lot of messages to shift through. 

When it comes to online dating, it's important to recognize that most people already have an idea of what they are looking for. So don't get frustrated or lose confidence just because this one girl won't message you back. Be genuine and nice when trying to secure a date. The worst thing you can do is come off as needy or creepy. And when you fail, move on and try again. "
soc_1450339,socialskills,reddit_comment,206,"Social skills are not that dry and clear cut. It depends on who you are talking to, depends on the question, depends how the question is asked,  depends on the intention of the question, and depression on the situation.

Yes / no questions are simple and to the point. Example ""Would you like some gum"". Yes / no questions are not good for being social, but do have ba place, such as in the example given. Yes / no questions can also feel like you are grilling someone.

""dodging questions (more specifically, the typical reason for not answering a question)"" We're not talking about job interviews or political talk here!

There is no such thing as ""the typical reason"". The  person just doesn't feel like answering, or doesn't feel like talking about it right now, or they prefer to talk about something else. For example, a person with a disability doesn't just want to constantly talk about their disability like that is what defines them. It's personal, a lot of people won't understand or will see it as just a  way to get sympathy, sone people will be rude, and gets really old and repetitive for them, and people don't like to hear about sad things."

Or they might just assume you’re busy &amp; not respond, and you’ll have hurt feelings. Either way, this approach damages relationships.

A better approach? You can discuss the issue directly or, if it’s a small thing, let it go. Of course, there are some people you may decide to avoid because they’re toxic and you just don’t want to be around them. That’s your choice too.

soc_358740,socialskills,reddit_comment,298,"When I was growing up, I used to hate any type of social interaction because I never knew what to talk about with other people. Everyone's interests seemed to be far off from my own, so whenever they'd bring up anything they liked, I got awkward and anxious because I knew it was only a matter of time before they looked to me for a comment, and I wouldn't have a damn clue what they were talking about or how to continue on the conversation. 

The best philosophy I ever picked up when it came to social interaction and skills, was to always be interested in what the other person was talking about. Of course, starting out, this is difficult, especially if they were talking about something I didn't particularly care about. So, I change the philosophy a bit. Instead of acting interested, look at every conversation you have with anyone as a learning experience. 

Everyone is different, and everyone has their own interests and knowledge over various things. So when speaking to someone, don't worry about trying to pretend you're interested in what they're talking about. Instead, be interested in the idea that you're trying to learn something from them. If they're speaking about football and you don't watch it, ask them questions to get more informed. Ask about the players, the best teams, the worst teams, gain some knowledge over the topic you know nothing about. 

Now, if you have a conversation with someone else about football, you've got some experience in that field of conversation and can use what you've learned. Either the next conversation you have will be you teaching what you know, or the new person will have some opinions about what you say and share his, giving you more knowledge over football. "

soc_739463,socialskills,reddit_comment,274,"Based on a good dating book I read, the sooner you confess your feelings the better your chances. When you give women too much time to think of you outside the potential love interest zone, they will eventually place you in a part of that zone that you cannot escape.

As for whether you should do it or not(in case that was a question), I can tell you from personal experience that if you get rejected it hurts like a bitch, but it’s like ripping off a bandage. It stings for a bit, but after a while it feels good. It feels good to love someone and for them to know that you love them. It frees your mind and sets it at ease. I highly suggest you do it. Every day that passed that I hadn’t confessed my love to the woman I cared for was almost worse than getting rejected. It festers and creates a pit of anxiety inside you that you aren’t fully conscious of. Again I condone telling her how you feel.

As for how, that’s mostly up to you. I suggest a private encounter, just the two of you. And I highly suggest looking her in the eyes confidently when you tell her. Also don’t pressure her to like you back, that’s how you make things awkward. To avoid making things awkward, you just tell her how you feel with a smile and whatever she says, you assure her you’re okay with it and thank her for listening. Be courteous. Women like all those things. Hell, all people like those things, but this girl will appreciate them the more."

How’s it going?” Or something like that. Ask her what she’s reading, or working on — indicates interest in her personality and her mind (which many girls feel complimented by). Nothing prying to start, like do you live near here, but after talking for a bit, you could say, “hey, would you like to get a coffee sometime?” and give her your number, or if you’re able to ascertain that she’s there regularly, then you can say, see you later, have a good day, then the next time you see her, you can say hi, see if she seems friendly, open, and then maybe ask her if she’d like to get a coffee sometime. Anyway, it sounds like she may be trying to indicate interest. Yay! Remember: make eye contact, treat her with respect, ask questions, don’t push too much, but be friendly (just my opinion).

But regarding broader ranges, can’t you just de-friend the person? Essentially, cut off the people who you internally don’t like and the deeper bond isn’t as great? Leaving u with 5 people with deep bond and with your choice. Basically like an interview with stages, and you can try to maintain the relationship with those people. Not immediately cutoff, but after establishing a deeper bond and you don’t like the person as well, a person. There’s a slow fade mode and you can get out of any friendship without scarring the person (if you consider it a problem)

That’s okay. You had reason for retreating from your life in this way and it was important in that moment.  Now that you have moved on, this is what you feel most safe doing, so you keep doing it.  

Again, it’s not who you ARE, it’s who you are choosing to behave as.  This means you can change it.  You can choose to slowly do different things. 

It won’t be easy because you will feel vulnerable, but with some time and effort you can do anything you want.  

I highly recommend you find a therapist to help you.  You aren’t alone and you are not the first person who has felt this way.  A good therapist will help you start to make progress and will be someone you can talk with.

It's such a terrible idea it might actually work.

But it's all about delivery and rhetoric. Don't do this over text. You're either going to be a complete asshole, or you'll find creative ways to start conversational flow. Maybe they will appreciate sarcasm.

Either way, you're taking high risk talking to ANYBODY nowadays. And you're taking risk NOT talking to anyone.

I personally want to meet people but I find most people are insufferable don't reciprocate interest and are really just looking for conformity and yes men to enable their toxic behavior with no accountability. They're probably not as nice or interesting as they seem. And people who come off rough are not as bad as you think.

If someone is vegan and can't deal with you eating meat, let alone being mocked for being vegan (jokingly) there's nothing you can say or do to make them like you or put any effort into wanting to talk to you. Even if you're willing to conform maximally, they won't respect you for selling out. You have to coincidentally already be a vegan and have all this experience and information on hand... Unless you're a girl and guys are simping for you. Then you just need a vagina and people will eventually go out of their way to talk to you at some point, in that case, just take your pick.

What you need in the conversation is context. You can talk about anything as long as there is interest in a topic. How do you bridge the gap between your interests and get their attention? Sadly, people are more drawn to negative attention and conflict. Make them convince you why Yoga is better than video games. Balancing that tension is high risk but also high reward and creates opportunities for sarcasm and irony.

I'd be pretty interested in Yoga, but I don't have a vagina. Oh, you don't need a vagina to do Yoga? Are you sure? Damn, I might have to try that. How can I be certain you have a vagina? 

Ask dumb questions. 

BTW, you can say this exact same sentence and depending on your social status and whether guys respect you or girls think you're cute or not, THAT'S ultimately the deciding factor of if this will work or not.

Seen first hand: popular guy walks up to a hot girls about a rumor he heard. Said I heard you don't have a gag reflex. Girl: ""Yeah? So?"" So I can stick my dick all the way down your throat and you won't choke on it? Girl: ""Yeah"". They dated after that.

Sad truth is it's not so much about WHAT you say so much as HOW you say it and WHO you are. It's materialistic and status oriented at the foundation of it all. You can say that same thing to a girl and it's probably not going to work.

Invest in yourself, come back later, try again.

Good luck talking to overly sensitive people that you have nothing in common with and toxic asf.

As a man, you're not valued. Nobody is going to reciprocate or offer you anything. Your only leverage is your freedom to walk away. And sadly people don't want to talk to you unless they feel they can leech something off of you. Whether it's money, entertainment, sex, social status etc.

My experience is that most women aren't interested at face value until they get jealous of another woman.

The only thing you can really do is invest in yourself. Don't go out of your way for anyone, especially people who won't go out of their way for you.

You want shared hobbies? Don't give a single fuck about anyone else's hobbies, because the reality is they won't care about yours, especially women.

Double down on your hobbies and what you like to do and get used to being alone because you're in for a long trip. Don't think so? Give it time.

Find more social hobbies you like, but do it for you, not for anyone else.

If you want friends who enjoy reading and video games.... well to be honest I don't know. Those people are probably tucked away in their homes. Maybe look online.

The answer lies within young grasshopper. The only answer is INVEST IN YOURSELF. That's it. Get rich, make money, do things you like. Someone will just show up eventually and start accommodating you. These people are accessories to YOUR life.

Do not waste precious time on shallow destructive people who don't see value in talking to you.

The reality is that if there was actual equality, people would be coming up to YOU asking YOU what YOUR interests are and at least meeting you halfway. It doesn't help when you have to entertain and carry the conversation. Don't settle. You'll have to deal with isolation and being alone. The ONLY answer is walk away, invest in yourself, and try again until people start to see  your value.

Truth is there's probably not a lot you can say at this point in your life to make people value you as a man. Your value will come later in life. It fucking sucks being a dude. Don't compromise. Invest.

You just honestly have to be lucky and in a good environment. Maybe I'm talking out of my ass, but this has been my experience from my environments. I don't know if anyone else relates to this or not.

You need to be willing to be an asshole to leverage your value and demand respect. Do not compromise your self respect. It will keep you alive when you have nothing else. 

You need to have a mindset that you’ve got nothing to lose from throwing your weight around. Get rid of your fear of failure and your insecurity or any shadow of a doubt and throw yourself into taking risks over and over again until it works. It’s not pretty. Stop caring what other people think. 

Most importantly, the foundation of it all. Be self validated. Respect yourself and value your thoughts, hobbies, and opinions more than other peoples. If they don’t compromise for you and meet you halfway and try to get to know you or don’t allow room for nuance, misunderstandings, difference of personality or humor, then fuck them. 

You will write off the people you DON’T want living this way for yourself and it will save you time. 

PS: I like Yoga, women, and vegan food. It's just the truth. Being an asshole when necessary is the most rewarding skill in getting your value out of life."

soc_1451291,socialskills,reddit_comment,231,"&gt;I (26 F) sent my apologies to someone (27 M) and his reaction was to downplay my hurtful action (I know it was not sincere) only to conceal his true feelings and show He's not vulnerable. I am just curious as to why a man would do that.

This is one of my biggest pet peeves, constantly having our reactions and emotions be assessed, reassessed and judged as being not ideal or 'not correct'.

Everyone is different, I open up with my girlfriend, sister, mum and some old bloke at work called Rob but I'm not comfortable sharing my emotions with friends or other family members, I do what makes me comfortable. They are my emotions and I'll process them my way.

Men aren't some alien hive mind species, we're people, if he didn't want to be vulnerable in that moment he probably didn't feel comfortable doing that and that's entirely his choice and the reasons for doing so are his alone, to ask men to speak on behalf of an individual man just undermines his individuality. If you want to know why he responded that way, you need to ask him, no one else.

&gt;only to conceal his true feelings and show He's not vulnerable.

This is the most annoying part, you hurt him and then you go judge how he accepted your apology and made it about his shortcomings?"
soc_709732,socialskills,reddit_comment,342,"I'll echo other people's sentiments and say that just the act of going should be celebrated as a big victory. You didn't stay home, you did something uncomfortable and put yourself in a position to make something happen. Bravo.

So maybe it didn't wind up in being the most fun time ever. It's a data point; maybe tailgating isn't the place to be. The people you went with having scattered - if there was no original plan (e.g. ""let's go to x place and post up"") maybe you had a misconception as to what would transpire. It's easy to want and assume the best things will happen, but sometimes we need to take the responsibility to make those things happen by having a plan. 

Kudos for making an important first step and just diving into the pool, so to speak. You didn't drown, you're still alive. Now you have some data (""these people don't want to hang out with me"", ""this activity was fun/not fun""), let that inform your decision making going forward. Don't let one bad experience keep you from experiencing a good one in the future. Keep your head up, make a plan, try again, repeat. You've got this.

Edit: regarding seeing other people's fun times on Instagram, forget that shit. Social media is self-aggrandizing and toxic. Focus on your own story and if you choose to share that via insta or whatever, your choice, but don't go down the rabbit hole of self-hate because you didn't have fun when other people did. Some people have fun at amusement parks, some people enjoy BDSM, some people enjoy reading. Just because someone is enjoying something doesn't mean you have to enjoy it too. As mentioned above, you tried something. If you think it'd be a fun time under different circumstances, plan it out and try it differently next time. Just please get off social media and looking at other people having fun. Focus on the next opportunity that you can have fun. It's a far more constructive use of your time."
soc_747020,socialskills,reddit_comment,160,"As an introvert married to an extrovert, I can relate. I have often stayed home while my wife went out. I love the quiet time. I do have a few close friends that I hang out with and that helps. Also, introverts tend to lose interest in small-talk and want a deeper connection. It can all go hand-in-hand. 

Not sure if depression causes loss if interest in other people, usually it’s loss of interest in things that were enjoyable before. I also think being depressed that you want to hide and not show you’re depressed. I can relate but have found over time the best thing to do in that situation is the opposite and try to put myself in a social state. It has taken many years to get better at this. I’m 34, got married at 23 so I understand the safety blanket thing. I broke out of that a little more in my 30’s, everyone is different."
soc_1503880,socialskills,reddit_comment,205,That’s the problem. You’re worried about other people when you should be worried about yourself and the others who are on the same page as you. Everything you said is valid and even if she had a problem with your actions you can easily just restate what you said in this post to her. How she takes it from there should give you enough information about the type of person she is and then you can make your decision on how to interact or deal with her. We all have voices… so use yours. Don’t think about how others will perceive you because what you do or say will be in the perception of their own lives. For example your friend might respect you more for speaking up and expressing your mind compared to if you just let it slide and kept quite which would give her the perception that maybe you don’t actually have a real issue with her being late even tho it really effects you and the others around you. Keeping in mind the other person who catches the train could just be irritated as you if not more because of you other friend but they just don’t say or show anything.

Is it just being able to both have a good time? Is it about being there for each other in hard times? Is it someone you know you can trust or is there more to it?

To be honest, I am not sure that everyone uses the same definition of the word ""friend"". Everyone has their own meaning and use of that word. My definition of ""friend"" may be different from yours.

IMO, the same goes for the word ""soulmate"". Everyone has a different grasp on its meaning and usage. Some consider it 'codenpency' and others might consider it when being married or being in a strong and healthy relationship.

soc_15738,socialskills,reddit_comment,376,"i understand where you are coming from, but what I'm trying to say is yes. you should be mad, any person in their right mind WOULD be mad.

But, what I'm trying to say is that being mad WILL NOT fix it.  The average person would do this: stay mad, never resolve the friendship and would lose 1 person.

What you should do is be the BETTER MAN.  Man up to your feelings, control them, become the better man, not sulk, deal with it, and accept that life hands you these moments.  It is up to you to become OPEN minded.  You are filled with anger right now, and I don't think that is wrong.


But, it comes down to how you deal with the anger.

A great friend, would understand that punching someone or yelling at someone is not cool.  you should understand this.


* Something I think everyone should be better at is think from HIS perspective.  Lets put away YOUR anger for now and honestly think from his perspective.  I would imagine that he has found friends he likes more, and has begun to hang out with them.  He notices that you are now sad, but that isn't fun to be around, he ignores you because he wants to have more friends, he is moving on.  Try to understand from his point of view.  He wants to make more friends, and you are getting angry at him.

* What I promise you, is anger NEVER really solves anything, it only makes it worse.  If this is difficult for you to understand, try flipping you and your friend, image you guys were switched.  Would you even remotely want to hang out with someone that wants to PUNCH you? Someone that is just filled with anger, and doesn't want to become open minded at all?

* Essentially, you can change YOURSELF to be better! or stay the same and just complain.  In life, you will learn that it is very difficult to change others, but you can easily change yourself.

**There is a great quote that I know of**

*“Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned.”*"

There was seemingly some interest there, but now they are perhaps thinking that they got it wrong. This is easily fixed. Just ask them to have lunch with you. Or grab coffee after work.

soc_1750456,socialskills,reddit_comment,165,"Even though I don’t like being cold approached in general I think it’s socially acceptable to do it in certain spaces.  Bars, clubs, social events. I go to a jazz night once a month and a museum night and I’m often approached there and I think those are good places for men to approach women. They’re scenarios where people are being social, either on their own or in a group and there is an expectation of social interaction. 

It’s the completely random public approaches that really unnerve me. On public transit, shopping, on the street. Where it’s unexpected, you’re somewhat trapped, and it often illicits the bad responses when uninterested in engaging. 

Personally, I’ve mostly dated people I had an existing friendship or common interest with. I’ve mostly met people through friends of friends, hobbies, volunteering. I have dated men off online dating but that’s typically after establishing a fairly good connection first. 

Again, this is all my personal preference. All people will be different."
soc_89179,socialskills,reddit_comment,191,"*First question:*

Well, for one you should do interesting stuff. These don't necessarily have to be spectacular. Just talking about an event you went to, a concert or a really weird play makes some good conversation options.

Everyone has nights where they just sit inside the house browsing Facebook, but if you want to tell stories, you need to live them. Get outside the house, and see what this world has to offer. Not just for being able to tell stories to people, but also just to enjoy yourself.

*second question:*

Do I get this right? A guy goes up to you and he just repeats your name until you acknowledge him? Seems weird.

When I see a person I know and I'm in a conversation, I wave or nod at them, but then I just continue the conversation. If he wants to join in, I introduce him to the person I'm talking to. (unless it's a private conversation, in which case I ask him to excuse us for a moment)

However, if a guy would just walk up and keep repeating ""ruberto ruberto ruberto ruberto"", I'd be pretty freaked out."

Serious advice though, don't be straight-up personal all the time. Ask about her interests and go from there. A bit of humour/sarcasm is good to throw in when talking to girls too. You'll get personal once you get closer later on. 

Also, good job on realizing to not put her on a pedestal, but I don't think focusing on just talking to her is a great idea when you're both in class. Ask her to hang out after class and make a few jokes and some light conversation throughout the class. Speaking from experience, that's probably a better way to go. Unless it's a blow-off class, but that's up to you to decide. Depends on whether or not she focuses on it.

soc_1819232,socialskills,reddit_comment,427,"A month and a half is a relatively long amount of time to be dating someone so it seems like you two have chemistry. I don't know the dynamics of your relationship with this girl but honestly, intimacy level is also a pretty important bit of information. You've made the leap to verbally and physically flirting with her, has it gone further than that? Have you established emotional intimacy with her at all through vulnerability and openness? Would you consider yourself close with her or are most of your conversations relatively surface level? Do you know exactly why you felt so uncomfortable on your last date? Depending on what kind of relationship you want with her and what she wants with you, it may be worth it to be open about how you were feeling on your ""bad date"".

I'm not talking about dropping a dump truck of emotional baggage on her by any means, only being honest with her about why you were nervous to make a move. This part is purely conjecture at this point, but from the sounds of what you're saying it seems like you went on dates semi-regularly for a period and it allowed you to warm up to her more quickly and become closer, and then that schedule of dates was interrupted for whatever reason and it threw the vibes off between you. Maybe you were worried about messing things up by reestablishing that prior level of physical intimacy after a period of not being able to.

You say she already knows that she's the first person you've seriously dated and she is okay with that, you say she was happy when you initiated physical contact with her, hell, by your own admission the first few dates weren't great but she keeps going on more with you, it sounds like she likes you. Being honest about why you felt worried isn't going to burn the possibility of a relationship, but it will show her that you can be introspective, that you aren't looking to be dishonest with her or make her uncomfortable, and that the possibility of a relationship with her means something to you.

However, it's really up to you to gauge the level of intimacy that you believe is appropriate at this point in your relationship because the dynamics of a relationship are very hard to convey to internet strangers over a single text post. 

That being said, try not to overthink things too much next time, there's a reason she keeps going on dates with you. Good luck."
soc_1263769,socialskills,reddit_comment,321,"I had a similar experience my last high school year. A really cute twin girl said I’m so fun to talk to and be around, but the reason she never talked to me years before is because I seemed “closed off and like I hated everybody.” At first I just blamed it on my resting bitch face as it runs in the family. Lol. But I realized it wasn’t necessarily just that. I’m very passionate about the things talk about when I know about them. and I’m very honest and forward. Also my father wasn’t around so I had a hard time being able to tell if someone was being a lil stern vs a full on Asshole while they picked at my views. I can definitely see what she was talking about now that I’m older. Since my past experiences didn’t raise me to be a social butterfly like I once was, I finally saw that I just needed to adjust slowly. I picked a job that forced me to work on my social skills and picked up some tips along the way. Best thing I was ever told was be yourself cuz it comes across as fake or not genuine. I finally have learned that I’m not gonna impress everyone and that there is nothing wrong with my lil quirks cuz everyone has them. It’s been 2 1/2 years I’m still learning, but I won’t forget that everyone is different and has different experiences. They may judge you off a past experience based off a single quirk you have. Don’t take shit to heart if they aren’t in your heart.

1. Dont' worry about how other people think of you. Put that kind of mentality in the bin. Just be yourself 100%. It's not easy, and it takes practice. But more you put yourself into this state of mind, the more you'll get better at it.   

2. When looking for friends, try to join community groups that share same passion are you. Whether it's playing video games, or drinking alcohol, clubbing... whatever it is. Try to get into a group that share similar passion with you. It'll make it easier for you to make friends.  

3. Lastly, as hard as this sounds, try to go out more where possible. Isolating yourself won't bring no good especially in this situation. You can start off with doing something simple first - something like shopping around for products you like. And gradually asking new friends to come out with you. 

Option is endless, and by the time you initiate - you'll most likely have your unique way of socialising with people. Just don't give up! The fact that you were able to share this in reddit, you've already made a good start on it and I know you'll do an amazing job."

Being honest here - if you look at a lot of those subs with older guys who have extreme trouble dating (r/datingover30, r/virginityexchange, r/foreveralone) there is always something that they struggle with, that leads women to take a pass. The key is to find out what it is, but you have to do the work! You cant just have a couple rejections then be like ""I give up"" and never really attempt learn why you were rejected.

soc_1489389,socialskills,reddit_comment,658,"&gt;I just have to call out that your statement is false, because the other party could have made things interesting, they themselves could've applied the principles and be interested in me first.

The statement that everyone is interesting and up to you to discover what's interesting about them is a *mindset*. Apply it and you'll discover interesting things in seemingly uninteresting people. If you don't apply it, then don't complain about missing out on the results that people get from it.

&gt;I'm an exhausted, demoralized, maybe depressed, unloved person with some bitterness, who is genuinely not interested in getting to know most people. Authenticity is not welcomed.

This makes me suspect that you don't know how to be authentic or what authenticity means.

&gt;Yes, because as a narcissist, I'm concerned with my own needs, and I'm aware of the transactional nature of the world, so I know I need to take care of other people's needs to get what I want. This is literally the advice Dale Carnegie is giving, what everyone on this comment is giving, what you are reiterating.

You can look at it that way if you want to, it doesn't mean what you seem to think it does though. Let's say there's an imaginary person who perfectly acts out Carnegie principles everywhere they go. The principles are all about how to create win win situations. This imaginary person knows very well that whenever they give something, there's always a high chance that they'll get something back. A positive expected return. But let's say, hypothetically, there's a situation where the person chooses to help someone out knowing that they'll get nothing in return from that person. They know their help will be beneficial to that person, but they won't even get acknowledgment or gratitude in any form, maybe even the opposite. This hypothetical Carnegie person would help this person anyway, at least in some situations. Why? Because helping others can feel good. Does that make it transactional? No. It makes no sense to say that helping someone is transactional if you feel better afterwards and it's not transactional if you feel worse afterwards.

The other thing you're missing about the Carnegie examples is that win-win situations are generated unexpectedly from suspension of self-interests. As much as I agree with you that the examples are full of salesman A trying to game person B, the salesman only succeeds when they voluntarily suspend their selfish interests. They suspended it even for one second, the moment they asked a genuine question. You can say that these people are selfish 99.99% of the time in these examples, and that's fine, but the one second or the one question is what made the difference. You can't conclude that people can only ever be selfish just because they're basically always selfish.

&gt;If you still believe it's not, then go make friends with the person who you don't enjoy being around, who provides you nothing, who does nothing for you. Also, you can say don't keep tabs, but there comes a time, when someone is taking too much from the bar, or everyone around you is taking a little from the bar, (and nobody is paying), you need to close that bar, or else people will pile in and take everything from you.

This sounds like a figurative story from your past that you haven't healed from.

I think you're looking for answers in the wrong area. Social skills aren't preventing you from connecting with people. *You* are preventing yourself from connecting with people. You're afraid of it and you're fighting it off with blame, denial, self-justification. You have an unmet need that comes from human connection, otherwise you wouldn't be talking about this. You have something important at stake that you care about. If you want to find out what that need is, and why you're stopping yourself from having it, I recommend finding the right therapist to explore it with."
soc_1208070,socialskills,reddit_comment,201,"First, ask yourself this: Do you do the same thing (that you just said) with your friends? Do you approach them first? Do you only talk to them when you have nothing else to do?

They only talk to you when they have nothing else to do cuz that's just how life and socializing works. You make time for everything. You can't expect them to chat you everytime. Heck, approach them first! 

They didn't ditch you, they might think you're not interested in the first place. Just try to hang with your friend group even though you have nothing to say. Your presence is good enough. Everything else will follow/flow.

They didn't flake or ghost you, they might just be busy with other stuffs - be it work, games, personal life such as family, or their other friends. Like i said in the previous paragraph, your presence is enough for them to acknowledge you. You're not the center of everything so you can't expect them to include you in everything. They might prioritize other people more than you, and that's okay.

My thoughts isn't a ""be all and end all"". Different people/cultures function differently. Do whatever works for you mate :'&gt;"
soc_1710580,socialskills,reddit_comment,105,"Yeah understand OP that confidence isn't real tbh. It's just more about being sure of who you are. This world has alot of ignorant people in it that believes confidence is being overly loud and assertive. It's only confidence if that's your natural state. And for some it is. 

For other people, it might be more reserved but a guy who has a strong moral compass. Someone who gets his work done. 

The point is no one can tell you if you aren't confident or not because it is always coming from their idea of you. Learn yourself and be sure of who you are."
soc_579376,socialskills,reddit_comment,326,"Ohhhhh this one is a tough one my dude. First, you're completely fine. Try to look at yourself in a different perspective. Why are you feeling this way? Why should you express emotion you don't want to express? Why be happy when you don't wanna be happy? Why feel remorse when you don't give a f? And then go through your past moments and think what happened when you faked it and when you were real. People were more responsive when you faked it right? People love sharing emotions with others and that's a mean to connect with others and when that happens, brain let's them know that they are socially excepted and they are doing good. It's our instinct and brain does that stuff which isn't bad, it's necessary.

Now the problem is how do I genuinely become happy or sad or hyped? Maybe something in life is bugging you? Is life bringing you down? Your social circle is fill of toxic people? Your focus is being carried away by something and you focus on that everytime? I don't know which one it is for you so you have to decide. And if it is any of them I listed, go to your room, lock the doors, and get to learn yourself. Who am I? Why do I think that way? Why is this bringing me down? Either solve that thing or get rid of that thing. Maybe you need to find a purpose in life? Maybe you need to stop expecting s lot from people or expecting a lot from yourself? Maybe it's okay being relaxed and loose and not so focused or self aware. Actually being self aware is an amazing thing but sometimes you just gotta let it go.

Sorry I went off track a bit. I was thinking about those moments where I was monotone and it was always because something bothered me so that's my .02 dollars. Hope it helped."
soc_1566399,socialskills,reddit_comment,143,"Well I guess u if he's comfortable with you, it's good to give a try, but whether someone likes you or not, is pretty subjective.... Although there are parameters described in psychology of how to tell, neither r they accurate. 
It depends on you, if you feel like asking him out can be a hit.... Just gi for it
If you r so unsure, try asking him for a casual hangout... His rxn may take u to a better place.

But still if u wanna know, intrest is observing, do a change.... Haircut? New dress style anything, if he notices u r good to go, or maybe even a behavioural change... 
If he doesn't notice maybe he thinks you of just a friend, but that doesn't mean it's not gonna happen. 
The rest traits are subjective, hope this helped

soc_1237308,socialskills,reddit_comment,1338,"I'm going to try to play devils advocate because I used to be bitter and really pissed off like OP. I'm also still a virgin at 21 and got the hand hold and first kiss out of the way within the last month and still havent had a single romantic relationship that lasted more than a day. Everyone on reddit is going to sit here and tell OP that it honestly will get better and that sex in high school is overrated. OP will feel pissed off because it honestly feels difficult to relate to people who got the sex thing out of the way. 


I dont know how sex in high school felt because I've never experienced it, but I imagine and think to how insecure and defeatist I was and if I somehow found some way to get in some girls pants that shit would have SUCKED. Seriously, I had pretty shit hygiene and had so many problems that I had trouble actually putting forth the effort into. I mean I only recently started becoming ok with my penis size because I cut out tremendous amounts of porn. I also literally read tons of sex advice now and hopefully I wont be such a deer in the headlights when I lose it my first time.


I was incredibly misogynistic, and a very hard leaning conservative as a black kid who grew up poor at age 16. My values were incredibly fucked, and honestly the only thing I envy about high school is just that was a lot easier to socialize and interact with people. Depending on how you act in college you might be sociable or pick an extremely isolating degree like I did and fall deeper into a pit until you inevitably have a mental breakdown, reevaluate your whole life and what you actually want from it and take steps towards actively improving yourself. The girl I held hands with, we went on one date and I actively was not attracted to her but tried anyways and I was pretty much settling. 


Our personalities didnt sync at all and afterwards i met the funniest female uber which made me realize how bad that date was and how I didnt like that girl at all. The second girl I kissed at a bar after getting drunk and being too pissed about never making a move. I was actively trying to have a one night stand just to get it out of the way, but we made out and she gave me her number only to be ghosted afterwards. My friends were also leaving the bar and somehow in two minutes of conversation were taken back to these girls place and I was kind of happy for them but salty at the same time. No these guys are not male models, just average dudes, Idk wtf happened there. I dont know what I did wrong, but after those two experiences I kind of felt like it was good to see how those things felt, while also kind of regretting wasting those first experiences on woman I honestly didnt care for. 


Honestly, I never really cared a big deal about sex, but like OP it feels like every year that passes while being a virgin it's like Im straying away from a determined path. Yeah I know ""everyone is unique"", but sex is so heavily ingrained in media as this casual thing that just happens. So how much worse does it feel to see everyone speeding past that milestone while you are still stuck on the first level? Im kind of now coming to realize with how kind of nonplus I feel after these experiences that high school romance is crazy overrated. I get accustomed or settled on things really fast. 


Also, the insecurities about being a virgin dont just come out of nowhere. There was this kid in tenth grade, who constantly tried to pressure me into smoking weed or hound me to get in a fight with him. Sometimes after school he would hound me into walking with him and just do random shit like show me pictures of his dick on my phone. Why did I keep hanging out with this guy? I didnt try to, he just came to the spot where I hung out with my other friends and just annoy the fuck out of me. I also never told anyone no and tried to please everyone to avoid agressiveness. I only said no in extreme circumstences to things like drugs, alcohol, or violence.


 When I would walk with him to his girlfriends car, because she picked him up down the street for some reason instead of at school he would just grab her and have an intense makeout session just to make me super uncomfortable. No, im not making this shit up, dude would full on turn back and smirk at me afterwards and drive off. This led to further confirmation bias on my part that you pretty much have to be a piece of shit to attract woman, this paired with the several instances of rampant abuse and cheating I saw my dad inflict on my mom as a child. I just genuinely could never understand this mentality and never actually made attempts towards woman because i figured that my personality would sync up with virtually no one.


When I was 19 I told a group of friends I gamed with I was a virgin and they were in shock. I thought it was extremely common, but their reaction kind of made me start really thinking about why the hell I havent lost it yet. They took every chance they could to give me kind of shitty advice. They tried to prep me by having me give them responses to girls they wanted to text and etc. I was just hammered on how inexperienced I was and felt like a baby. Like some child. It starts making you feel like this one thing is keeping you from reaching everyone else's level. 


I typed all of this just to say this OP. It's your fucking life, live as cynical or as in doubt as you want. But one day all that bullshit negativity will catch up to you and you are going to be forced to make a choice or choose a path. Reddit in general is incredibly dismissive of others experiences if it isnt adhering to the life is always good/gets better if you just do this and this and as a result some will feel further isolated. You are going to be mad because others lives dont sync up to how you have lived or what you have experienced. How do you feel about life OP? 


 I'll give you my experience so far, Im in the middle. Some days I get a rush of inspiration or happiness, others I feel alone and I have no one to turn to. If I had sex with that girl that night would that have fixed it? Fuck, no. I live very limited and isolated experiences and probably none of what I said resonates with you, but try this challenge. Fuck reddit, are you going to continue your education or work? Do you have strong desires or dreams? I have too many and its hard to choose. I want to sing, dance, rap, draw, be an architect, play the guitar, the piano, produce animations, etc. Sometimes those random drives keep me from falling deep into the pit that is the collective human experience. Sometimes I realize how insignificant those 2-10-20-30 minutes might have on my total outlook on life and then it really makes me wonder. I just took an hour typing this out instead of working out and no one is going to read all of this. That's how incredibly funny and unexpected and random this all is. Just keep going OP.

Edit: Also music really helps lift your mood when you feel incredibly isolated. It makes you really ok with being yourself."
soc_551904,socialskills,reddit_comment,161,"I think that you're too outwardly/socially focused, you don't really know who you are yet and you look for clues from other people. You don't have much confidence in your own thoughts or actions so you always need a mirror to tell you how you're doing. 

As a side note, one of the reasons people start acting in this way is because they were taught to seek out approval from others. It's like running to mom or dad to show them your drawing so you can put it on the fridge, but on a bigger, more ""grown up"" scale. 

1. You are not, and never are, the opinions of strangers. They don't know you, only you know you. Aim to be realistic and compassionate with how you perceive yourself and other people. 

2. You need to keep track of your actions, how they made you feel, and what you got out of them. You are your own progress. 

Hope this helps! "
soc_930298,socialskills,reddit_comment,154,"You can either sit together and talk it over like grown-ups or mutually agree to let this all be water under the bridge. Either option would be very mature. You're going to have to give it some time, however, and show your friends that you've truly changed. This may or may not work out, but at least you're all trying to make up. That's good. You're all willing to move forward.

In my country, we have a saying that goes: ""Trust arrives on foot and leaves by horse"", meaning that building it is much more difficult and time-consuming than losing it. Don't beat yourself up, but don't expect everything to be the same again soon either. Give it some time, don't get defensive, put in the effort and see how it goes. You'll never be able to say you didn't try. This isn't just up to you, though; it's up to all of you."
soc_329082,socialskills,reddit_comment,275,"I can totally relate.  And especially understand the comment about wanting to be a good role model for your daughter.  My mother and I share a lot of the same weaknesses when it comes to forming and maintaining friendships, and I feel like I've inherited a lot of the same weaknesses and insecurities.  This makes me think of one of my favorite films Odd Girl Out, where the mother hid her friendless past because she wanted her daughter to be popular.  Probably because she had that same fear of not wanting that to carry over to her daughter.

I don't know if I'm one to give advice since I have the same issues.  The friends I attract most of the time are just not on my level in life.  Have no education, no ambition, etc.  The ones I want to be friends with that are smiley and social and intelligent, even though on my level in many ways, seem out of my league for whatever reason.  I have severe social phobia and anxiety and am a bit of a hermit...all handicaps that work greatly against the easy to say hard to do advice of ""just get out there and meet people, it'll happen!""

So about all I can say I think is just stick with hobbies and activities that make you happy where you are truly comfortable being yourself, and try to manage expectations about the kind of people you will meet (age, gender, etc.).  That way you're less likely to feel like you're wasted your time if you didn't meet anyone, because you'll have been doing something you enjoy anyway, if that makes sense."
soc_33191,socialskills,reddit_comment,243,"I think I know what you are talking about. Let's scale it down to one on one conversation. When you converse with a close friends, you tend to skip the formality. How's your weekend is often answered with how they felt about that one thing that happened, what they were thinking while they did this and that... They share their thoughts, purpose and emotions beyond the I went to play volleyball. I assume its the level of sharing, more than just want you do but what you think, feel, and desire. I have a few friends who will entertain these thoughts with me for hours. 

Now, in a group setting, no one is truly interested in your own thoughts. However a common concern and interest are discussed. When I was still in school, I spent a good deal of time with my study group. We were worry about classes a lot, not everyone was failing but everyone was stressed. And a good talk around the table was a relief. We remains good friends. 

I think the best way to reach those conversations is to simply pick the topics that force revealing answers. Instead of how, share what you thought, in the kind of way that you expect a response, then ask what they think. Perhaps the other will respond to that. 

I have no clue. Its all about being comfortable sharing your own thoughts and emotions and others will open up to you.  "
soc_1127150,socialskills,reddit_comment,319,"To all of your questions, I'd answer yes. So this is where we can see how different each person is in how they perceive giving and receiving.

I believe you can love someone who has hurt you. Even if you part ways, you can be thankful for the things you DID like about them. It's not black and white.

Being paid less doesn't make me care less about doing a good job. And if I choose to work for free, it's my choice, and I do the best I can spare for free.

I don't have a time limit on friendships or acquaintances. If I know you, then I know you forever, and if I want you at my party, you'll be invited. Doesn't matter if you haven't talked to me in years. If I miss you, I'll reach out. If you don't respond, maybe I'll reach out rarely, but it doesn't change the way I view you, because I'm just grateful for the opportunity to know you. People are allowed to move on and live their own lives, I don't have to be part of it to appreciate them.

I don't ever expect gifts. If someone thinks of me and gets me a small one, I'm grateful. But me wanting to brighten someone's day or surprising them with something nice comes from MY love of THEM. It is not conditional on THEIR love of ME.

If I like you then I like you, it's simple. Why would I care what you think of me in return? So I tend not to get along with people who expect a trade-off for everything. I don't do trades. I just live and let live.

We can't assume everyone we interact with thinks the same way as us. I wouldn't seem like a good friend to you, because we'd never see eye to eye. But neither of us is doing something ""wrong""."
soc_958313,socialskills,reddit_comment,340,"Hi. Firstly, I'm so sorry about what happened to you. I hope this helps.

1. I think you should try to develop your personality more, before you try interacting with others. Find interests and hobbies like reading or gardening. Something that you really enjoy. Also develop your core beliefs, such as: dogs are better than cats, toxic masculinity sucks, etc. These are things that are *really important* to you. They are central to who you are.
2. Once you find these interests, seek out others who have similar interests. The most important thing is to have the same core beliefs. Otherwise, you may find yourself fighting over them. Listen to when people express their opinions, and if they happen to be similar to yours, talk to them about it. Phrases like, ""Really, me too!"" Or something like that can really help someone open up to you. Talk to them even if it's just discussing that one thing you both like. Develop a bond.
3. Just try to talk. Express what's on your mind. This way, people see what kind of person you are. Don't feel pressured to change if they don't like what they hear. That kind of person is just not right for you.

Here's some tips for understanding conversations better:

1. If someone's talking a lot about a specific topic, they probably like it and are passionate about it.
2. If someone is telling a story or anecdote, try not to interrupt them. Instead, if you have something to add, speak up after they're finished. This is polite and shows them you're interested in what they have to say.
3. Key body language

* Crossing arms, sighing, huffing: they're angry
* Grabbing the sides of their head: worried or stressed. Probably both
* Can't stop moving: energetic or excited. Some people are like this all the time, it's just part of their personality
* Hands on hips: maybe aggressive, in control
* Hands held in front of them or behind their back: shyness

I hope this helped! :)"
soc_881775,socialskills,reddit_comment,975,"You’re missing the whole point, that 10/10 you at least went on a date with him to find out if he was a 2/10. You’re not doing anything with the guy who is a 2/10 with a 10/10 personality because you don’t even know he exists. Don’t act like women don’t think they can fix or change a man and won’t put that effort in to make that 10/10 have a better personality. You rarely find 10s with shitty attitudes so realistically that 2/10 who has a good personality is gonna lose to a 10/10 who had a decent average personality. There’s millions of people making online workout videos well before Chris Hemsworth and he’s only getting that light because he’s attractive. Sure he may be a good guy but answer this honestly, if Chris Hemsworth was in front of you would you even be able to see a ugly guy with a good personality? You get the idea. It is people like you who call him a incel which makes himself refer to one, hell anyone who says that dating is easier for women than men are called incels. You hate the harsh reality concept, you even call me a incel and I’ve done the self improvement. You can’t accept the fact that it doesn’t matter what a ugly guy does nothing will change that outcome. Is that a excuse to not improve, no. You can improve but don’t ever expect any women to ever find you attractive from it, that’s the point. So when people like you try to sell lies because you don’t want to hurt his feelings or make yourself feel better it does more harm than good. You’re still stuck on “hot” chicks when it’s women in general that fee that way about ugly men. Even by your logic he should be allowed to get ugly women with no improvements yes? There’s just as many ugly fat women that demand a super attractive man just because she’s a woman and other women flood her ears with “you’re beautiful and deserve nothing less than that” but men are told to shut up and take what you can get. EVERYONE has an entitled attitude, if you ever do anything and expect anything you are doing it for entitlement and validation reasons. No one has to be nice to you, no one has to thank you for anything that you do. You love preaching that to men but can’t accept that same treatment in return. 
Lmfao what? You as a woman have a massive advantage, you don’t have to do any work. I’ll define what work means later but you also can instantly go from a 1/10 to a 7/10 with makeup... just look at any makeup transformation video and you’ll see the type of advantage you have over men. Which means you can now land a 7/10 when in reality your league should be the ugly fat fucks at the bottom. So since those women are now getting hotter men there are no women for ugly men, as they say 80% of women fuck only 20% of the male population. Which means there’s 80% of men to pick from 20% of women. That’s not good odds, now back to “work” you don’t have to be confident to get dick, you don’t have to be funny to get dick, you don’t have to do anything at all to get dick. There are no men demanding you to be a size 0 because we don’t even know what that means. So at most you just have to not eat 24/7 and learn makeup. Men are demanded to be fit as well 8% body fat is insanely hard to achieve and it’s not even worth maintaining because you don’t even enjoy life at that weight. Not all men can grow a beard to hide their face, shocker I know. For some reason all women assume all men can grow massive beards and build houses with no experience. Incel is a newly made term to say virgin. That’s it, there will ALWAYS be virgins because of the 80/20 rule and most men then resort to escorts. You don’t seem to understand that not everyone has options, since you’re a woman you don’t get that. Even a ugly woman can get 100 matches on tinder with no effort but I couldn’t get a single match other than sex robots linking me to a site. I upgraded my life, money, body, spend hundreds on clothes, haircuts and styles and even on a base level I wasn’t any more attractive to women than when I weighed 350+, wore super baggy clothes and had messy hair. How am I suppose to show my shinny personality when I’m just ignored as before? So I just settled with being friends with women because they don’t mind having ugly friends (usually it’s to make them simp and pay for shit) and if you make a move they shut you down with the quickness and say “you’re not my type”. I don’t have 100k to drop on my face (since I would need a whole new face and there aren’t as many options for men as there are for women). Plus I would make ugly kids so no woman would want that either. I’m asexual now so i don’t give a shit about sex/relationships/ etc with anyone male or female. I’m happy alone and have no problem dying alone. I don’t want kids and I would never raise another persons kids. So I’m content how I am. I treat everyone with respect and just live my life alone and that’s okay with me, not everyone has “a special someone”. 90% of the women I know say every single one of their ex’s are assholes so it seems that’s a very desirable trait for women."
soc_1812204,socialskills,reddit_comment,499,"I am not the best at social situations but that is more for me not caring to follow the *""rules""* than not knowing them, even if it did take me a long time to learn them. You did what you are supposed to do with that, you were polite and asked if something was wrong, if anything, they were the rude one for not explaining why they were acting like that. Me, though I tend to outright ask ""what's wrong with my \_\_\_\_\_\_"" whatever I think they are noticing. It's never the same thing even if it's two people together they can be deciding two different things are wrong about me or what I am wearing. I've had a group of older ladies comment on four separate things wrong with my appearance at the nursing home I was visiting then looked surprised at each other that they didn't agree on what was wrong with me.  It took me turning to people I trust to learn that almost everyone has that internal this is allowed this is not allowed thing and some feel they can enforce their views on others.

It's a personal opinion that they are expressing and are deciding to judge others based on that personal preference. It could have been something as simple as them not thinking those boots went with what you were wearing or as complex as your features/hairstyle/accessories didn't match your clothes.

I have a more rocker style with touches of gothic pieces (Hot Topic has been a go to since I was in high school) and calling out people has gotten lots of responses. I had one really rude old man comment that someone like me didn't belong in *his neighborhood* when I was house/puppy sitting for a relative. Found out later he thought I was gay because only a gay female would have hair that short(it was a pixie cut) in his opinion though he didn't use nice words to explain it. That somehow my doc martens somehow proved I was gay as well that *real woman* didn't wear boots like that. The least I could have done was pretend like I fit in and not expose people to all of that was his complaint to my cousin. I didn't even know his name until after that day and my family only knew him by the classic car he drove but he decided things about me and that he could call me out for things even though I was a complete stranger. 

If it had been my cousin who made a comment about my hair or shoes I might have put some weight in it but some random person I don't even know the name of commenting they are not important to me so their opinion of me is not important. It took me a really long time to get to that point and I hope you get to that point too because that's all you can do with something like this."
soc_254321,socialskills,reddit_comment,289,"Take this from me. I also didn't drink when I started college. I had never drank in high school. 

By November, I was taking straight shots of gin on a Tuesday night. 

Drinking is not that bad. It's pretty fun. I'm not gonna tell you, START DRINKING SO U CAN HAVE FRIENDS! I'm gonna say try it. For one time, no matter how bad it tastes, finish the first 2 drinks. Then have a 3rd. If you like things so far, have a 4th. For your first time getting drunk, I really wouldn't go past 5 drinks, unless you space them out with lots of time and water. 

If you do this and you are like ""well that sucked"", then I have nothing else to say to you. You have passed the test and now have the ability to go to any party, not drink, and still have fun. Congrats!

If you do it and you're like ""that was pretty lit"", well, good! Maybe you should repeat the experience next party, but be responsible. 

One of the big things to remember is there's no shame in drinking, nor is there necessarily any glory in not drinking. You aren't a bad person if you drink. You aren't smarter/more responsible/better than anyone who drinks because you have decided not to. 

If you don't wanna drink ever for whatever reason, you're good. Just don't like talk about it all the time. Try to find parties through your roommate, friends, classmates, clubs. Clubs are awesome everyone in your club will love you and want you at the same parties they're at if you are a cool member.

Your parents expecting you to ensure they don't do anything naughty, while they have their views and is fine on its own, does put a strain on your relationship with your friend and your brother, whether they admit it or not.

Judging from your post, you seem to be a girl which makes things a bit harder in terms of just talking with people, but that shouldn't discourage you from making friends. Try to chat up with the people sitting next to you in the class. Ask about the homework, ask them what they think about the professor, or if anything fun is happening around campus.

Generally, i think its true that this starts w confidence, in yourself, in your identity. Kinda useless advice bc it is up to you to foster that confidence that I know you can achieve. For example i shaped my identity from my hobbies. I think its helpful bc then ure more likely to be w someone who shares said hobby and its easier to geek out about it w someone whose into it. Thats not to say like you have to be this way all the time but you deserve to feel generally good about yourself all the time. This leads me back to maybe the most impactful step i took which was going to the gym bc its something you can control.  This is bc endorphin(endogenous morphine) is released afterwards so those opioid/feel good receptors are activated. And when you see progress after a couple months at that point you keep doing it bc you like seeing yourself improve imo.

Since this is subjective anyways, my personal list includes compassion to the homeless, those ppl who encourage you to keep going when ure talked over, being able to speak your mind (which i cant always do), goofy weird, etc

Edit: Best of luck hope i could point you in a tangible direction. Can dm me if you want me to elaborate. Ik i can be p vague"
soc_1418830,socialskills,reddit_comment,140,"You can’t make someone be your friend, and the idea that you want to “make” her your friend so that you can eventually turn this into a relationship is definitely offering up creepy vibes. 

Just be yourself and if you click then you will be friends. Girls aren’t some fantastical and mysterious beings who approach friendship in a totally different way - just try to be friends by being yourself and being curious about her life or her interests/opinions, etc. or try to spend platonic time together (I’m going to see the new Spider-Man movie, wanna go?)

And DON’T expect a relationship *just* because she becomes your friend. That’s not how that works. Friendship doesn’t earn you anything but reciprocated friendship. If a relationship develops then great, but it’s not up to you to “turn” her friendship into something else."
soc_1439993,socialskills,reddit_comment,252,"People are not made of stone or paper and anyone who expects people to stay the same and have the same opinions and ways of being all the time are a little bit unrealistic. We are all multifaceted beings with the capacity to change and learn and focus/hone in on different parts of ourselves at different times. Some people are more ""change-y"" than others and both ways of being are valid.

You are right in that confidence is key. You can't control what other people think of you and you never will be able to. You need to be able to appreciate you for who you are. For me, I sometimes express an opinion, and then in another conversation I change it. How do I handle this? I just pro-actively own it. ""Yeah, you know I used to think x, but now considering different factors I actually think Y is better now"". Change is a part of growth and maybe you've met these friends during a time of personal growth for you.

But maybe you also have to think consciously about whether your opinions change because you genuinely are swayed or learn something new... if you are changing opinions just because you want people to like you more or you don't want to rock the boat, that's different. That's where you cross the line into being ""fake"" (I think the word fake is harsh though) or maybe more a ""people pleaser"" 

So yeah, think about *why* you change. I think that's key."
soc_77092,socialskills,reddit_comment,389,"&gt;What bothers me is that I always attract people that complain about stupid and whiney shit. One of my coworkers always complains about how everyone hates her and she is always getting yelled at (neither one is true at all!!!) and I have to fucking hear about it all the time.

If this is the way you feel, then be sincere about it. Rather than trying to comfort people, analyze what they're saying and try to reason with them. If someone is moping about something that's completely untrue, call them out on it. Show that you're not going to reinforce their bias by providing sympathy, and instead challenge it. At the very least this'll reduce the amount of people coming to you who want someone to nod along and feel sorry for them. It also shows that you have a certain amount of self-respect when it comes to your own opinion and observations, rather than being so willing to agree with whatever is thrown your way.

&gt;I think part of the problem is that I never complain about things because I dont want to burden people, I view my problems as my own.

So you're willing to hear-out everyone else's problems, but you refuse to share your own with others? That's not selfless, that's self destructive. You shouldn't see yourself as being beneath others, willing to carry the baggage of anyone who hands it to you while refusing to let anyone help you with your own. You've got to put yourself first here. You are the most important person in your life after all. I mean there's nothing wrong with being nice to people, but if it reaches a point where you're bending over to serve others, then you have to realize that there's an imbalance in terms of give and take.

So if someone comes up to you and starts complaining about their life, I want you to think about how it makes you feel. If you genuinely want to hear what they have to say, then hear them out, but be sure to poke holes in what they have to say if it's inconsistent with the truth. If you're sick to death of their shit, either be blunt about it or make an excuse up. The priority here is how you feel, not how someone else feels. "
soc_112190,socialskills,reddit_comment,513,"I think perhaps the article is suggesting that some things are better understood through context, at least things might be too awkward to say out loud. Imagine that the person who organized the gathering or party overhears that you are bored. If it would register the same as a verbal cue, why would you risk offending someone?

On the other hand, you don't have to necessarily say things like ""I'm bored"" straight out, whether you are communicating verbally or non-verbally. It might be better instead to show it by suggesting a game or change of venue. Actions speak louder than words and non-verbal hints.

Sharing subtle, non-verbal cues can also bring people together, connecting over little things. Sharing a joke in the middle of a group, just the two of you, can make you feel closer to a friend. Whether or not what you share is positive is up to you and the friend, of course. It doesn't have to be critical or exclusionary - it could be a joke that you'd be okay sharing with anyone but it just so happens that you were only speaking to one person at the time. If someone else notices, then you can share with them, too.

It is very difficult, however, to deal with non-verbal cues both from and to people you are less familiar with. If someone makes a hint, trying to suggest something that you don't think is cool can be tricky to respond to (and would probably depend on how bad it is). If someone joked to me about, say, humping a girl who had just turned her back toward him I would definitely say out loud ""dude, not cool"" then leave it at that. If it was just someone being really irritable and impatient, without being overly rude or offensive, I might just look away and not communicate back or shake my head. You can't blame them for doing it non-verbally, though, it's not the non-verbal communication that's the problem. It's the attitude, which isn't always there.

I couldn't count how many times I've made eye contact with a stranger, to smile with them at the way a dog or kid is behaving on the subway and enjoy that moment with them. Or to shrug my shoulders to say ""well, what are you gonna do?"" when there's a delay later on that same train. These are nice moments, and no words are said. (You really do have to recognize the expression of the person, of course, making eye contact and such to decide if they would understand, but those are just examples of positive uses of non-verbal messages.)

Really, when it comes down to it all communication is manipulative. We are trying to interact and get the attention of the people around us, to have them agree with us and like us and to do that we are using all the tools at our disposal, trying to sway social dynamics in our favour. Manipulating doesn't have to be a power-thirsty act. It's one of many ways to deal with your surroundings.

soc_1409639,socialskills,reddit_comment,323,"Don’t give up. I was 22 when I met my future wife, I was in the Military: Infantry NCO. It was love at first sight. Then I found out she had a 5 year old son. Talk about hitting the brakes. We were friendly and acquaintances for the next 18 months. I was not ready to be a father. Specially after growing up in a toxic broken house and being used by both parents to hurt one another by send me to live with the other and then being sent back again at 11 &amp; 15, it destroyed my self esteem. I had to work really hard at being a man able to stand up for myself and lead men in a combat environment. 
Alas, there came a day when I realized I want a life with her and would take that responsibility of raising another man’s child as my own. 
Here is the kicker. I took her on one date with her son, to the State fair. I asked her to marry me at the end of the date, she said yes. We married two weeks later. She got her first kiss from me the day of our Wedding, an hour before our ceremony. We’ve been faithfully married for over 33+years. We had two more a son and a daughter and I adopted her son as my own. Like I said I waited and waited until I found someone I was willing to take a chance on. She took a chance on me too. If you are yourself and be honest with everyone life can take you places you never expected.

soc_151293,socialskills,reddit_comment,161,"Ehhh don't do that. People will never fully warm up to you because they can tell that it's a polite laugh or a polite smile. It also pressures them to keep up the funny or be on their toes. It's better to keep a straight face, but you have to stop them from feeling self-conscious. I usually tease people gently about how bad the joke was. You have to make it okay for them to tell a bad joke. Always, always, always establish comfort by being genuine to create rapport. Rapport is what creates long-term friendships, and it'll establish trust. I felt something similar when I started improving in social skills. For me, the indifference stemmed from feeling like I was better than some people as if I needed to accommodate those who weren't as funny/witty/cool/""confident"" as me. I didn't treat everyone the same way, and that's a big red flag for people. They don't need your help. Worry about yourself."
soc_1644165,socialskills,reddit_comment,154,"I think that it really depends on how you look into it. All of the things you mentioned you define as having a true friendship and most come from, as other commentaries said, movies and media. Friendship has many types and fixating on one will limit your chances of experiencing it fully. There are types of friends who rarely talk or even meet yet they're there for each other in big moments of life. There is also the friends that surprise you with how much you 'click' when first meeting. The thing is, believing yourself to have no 'true' friends just because it didn't happen in a scenario you want doesn't mean you will never find that type of friendship. You definitely deserve to have a great companion(s) in your journey and will most definitely notice as you grow old that you had them, albeit different than how you wanted.

soc_874361,socialskills,reddit_comment,192,"You want to be someone that you are not. It seems that there is more to that story. You don't enjoy being around a lot of people, so why do you want that? Are you unhappy with your life, and you idealize what ""being normal"" is like? Are you lonely, and wished to have a connection with someone without putting the work that goes into it? Do you just deslike yourself?

I think first and foremost you should work on building a relationship with yourself. You are running to this ideal of ""normal"" that doesn't really exists, instead of dealing with your actual problems. A lot of times parties just suck, having a large social group implies in a lot of drama and building a connection with someone takes a lot of work. Every single relationship is painful - the more close and meaningful it is, the more it will hurt. People endure it when is worth it.

For you, it takes more effort to interact with people, and you don't get as much from it. So you should try to suffice your needs in a way that makes sense to you."

Picture this, you are the captain of a sinking ship with a storm raging. The damaged ship wasn’t all your fault, the waves caused the damage and things went out of your control. But now what? You have the tools to repair your ship and perhaps outlast the storm, but will you? Will it get better or will you watch the ship sink as the end begins? 
That ship is your body and mind, most of the physical characteristics you mentioned can be naturally changed, confidence can be boosted too, it’s all about mindset. The raging storm is society and the world, you have no control over it yes, but you control the ship and its condition, a good captain can navigate through the storm with practice. For example getting a job isn’t easy but it isn’t impossible. 

Moving forward isn’t going to be easy, fixing the ship will be difficult and you may falter. So whether you sink or swim is up to you, up to what you do next.

soc_76005,socialskills,reddit_comment,1030,"&gt; Okay since you brought this up I have to ask because i'm skeptical about some things. Doesn't being a girl now help you in that you are more easily accepted by other women as one of their own? Aren't you part of their inner circles? 

I'd say it's a tougher scene than the straight dating scene because realistically, I have to go after bisexual girls who are into people like myself. There are more of these than I thought at first, but it's still the case that 95% of the girls I run into are straight. The dating pool is relatively small. I could only realistically date a small minority of the women my age I meet.

Then, there's the fact that gay/lesbian dating is a tiny bit more complicated in general. If you're a straight guy, you could possibly flirt with a random girl you meet at a party. I have to play it subtle if I don't want to make people feel awkward. Then, of the bisexual girls out there, not all of them want to face the stigma of dating a lesbian (or even a transsexual), most of them end up dating guys, because it's the simpler option.

As far as inner circles go, I don't think so. If I'm friends with a woman, then that usually means we're at a point where dating is already excluded. Either because they're straight, or we don't have the sensual kind of relationship. I don't know if most lesbians are like that. I honestly don't have that many friends, either. Still working on developing better social skills and learning to maintain friendships.

&gt; Also you are pretty hot looking girl so i'm assuming (probably wrong assumption) that it would be easier for you to attract equally attractive girls who are into girls...

Being attractive probably makes it easier, I suppose. Of the women I've rejected though, it usually wasn't because of their looks. It's often because I didn't like their personality.

&gt; If you do not find it too personal for me to ask, are you post-op?

Kind of annoying how everyone wants to ask that question, but if you must, I haven't had that kind of surgery. I spent 30K on other plastic surgeries instead. Not planning on getting my genitals reconfigured.

&gt; This all very fascinating and i'm curious how else you feel your dating life has changed and what you took away from it?

It's actually a bit unfair to compare before and after, because well, before, I didn't have a dating life. I was dealing with being trans, and an unmedicated schizophrenic mother with psychotic episodes. I was raised by a crazy woman, and I lived as a hermit computer nerd. I never went out, never saw anyone outside of school.

My social life began during my undergraduate studies. I began gain financial independence, and slowly open up to the world. My dating life began after my transition was already started. I lost my virginity to a girl I met on craigslist casual encounters. She was very kind, and we ended up having a 5 year relationship. She changed my life for the better.

&gt; Also you say chicks dig assertiveness, does that mean its true that looks aren't as important as guys think they are, and that confidence can make up for it?

My take home lessons would be...

For one, I truly believe that dating women, whether you're a guy or a girl, is largely similar. Women, in general, do very little approaching (straight or gay, it's the same). You have to approach. If you wait for women to make the first step, nothing will happen. At least, that's how it was for me, nothing happened until I became more proactive.

Your looks probably matter a lot less than you think. I've seen unattractive people with shitty personalities (selfish, egotistical, unkind people who always talk about themselves) who get laid quite a bit, or are constantly getting in new relationships. Arrogant people who have no shame seem to get laid a lot. Not because they're arrogant, but because they're not afraid to approach people, they don't doubt their own value. They'll just hit on people they find attractive and start talking. Eventually, they'll meet someone who's attracted enough to them.

People like it when you show interest in them. Most women won't be mean if you approach them. They might turn you down, but most aren't mean about it. You also shouldn't take it personally when it happens. You aren't interested in everybody who might be interested in you, so why should they?

Approaching people also doesn't have to be complicated. Just say hi, introduce yourself, find some silly excuse to start a conversation. What you say doesn't matter all that much. Just imagine yourself in their shoes. Some pretty girl comes up to you, and compliments your shoes. Obviously, she's just using some random excuse to talk to you, but you aren't going to be mean to her, she's just playing the game. If you're attracted to her, all you have to do is find some way to keep that conversation going.

In the end, I think dating and hooking up is all about numbers. Meeting more people, being friendlier, more social. Those things will help you. Having a bigger friend network and getting introduced to more people will help you. Friends will also help filter out people, introduce you to people you might actually like.

What else can I say. Confidence helps not just with approach, but because it plays into the female psyche in a very deep way. They can smell your confidence (or lack thereof). Sorry if this is offensive to some, but I think the prototypical female fantasizes about a strong, confident man (or woman) who will sweep them off their feet. The prototypical woman wants a sexual partner who will be *slightly* dominant in bed. Someone mature, intelligent, and sure of themselves. A leader, an alpha, whatever you want to call it. Someone powerful. You have to make them believe you're that someone. Even if inside you doubt a little bit, you have to silence that doubt."

It wouldn’t matter and you would not have gotten mad because you didn’t hear me. My point is, things only matter when we stop living out lives, think about situations and then over analyze them. Stop giving that little voice in your head so much power."
soc_157408,socialskills,reddit_comment,585,"oh man, im sorry to hear that.  I understand what you mean by Chernobyl of social interactions!  Thanks for telling me your story, makes me happy that you actually tried to work with my way of interacting and responding to me looking for more advice.  Especially out of all the other people there is in the thread :].  

Yeah i had a similar experience before where I would ask how to do the homework, and try to create small talk, but all they responded was either one word answers or prefer not to keep a conversation going or show no interest.  Man, imagine how I felt, or me and you.  We're just trying to connect with a couple people but they don't seem interested in getting to know each other.

But, the honest truth is that not everyone is interested to make more friends or interested in learning more about a person or getting to know them.  Everyone has a different personality and they would only click with you if they had something in common that they love and you love.  I already explained about complimenting something about them that not everyone has.  But, that's more for trying to pick up a chick/guy or you're interested in complimenting them.  But don't be too hard on yourself.  I know a couple of friends that when people barely meet them, they just answer the questions and keep to themselves.  They don't put the effort in trying to know the person because they just simply don't care.  They might just be there just to go to class and leave, or they already have a boyfriend/girlfriend and not interested in meeting more people.  People usually connect through having same interest.  You would need something that would make them go, Interesting or WOW, i would like to know more about this guy or what he's done.  But mostly people enjoy talking about themselves other than listening to other people.  

Everyone is different remember that, so don't take yourself down too hard.  Matter of fact, this semester in school, i don't have any friends in class.  I mean i talk to a couple people, but it's not like we stay connected.  However, Last year, I made two friends that i eventually got their facebook and we hung out after class and got food together.  We just clicked.  I don't talk to them anymore though, it was just a short Chemistry hang out buddies because we had same class and studied together.  Just try to pass this semester, and try again next semester.  Next semester you can be more open because you're used to rejection now.  PLUS, they never met you before so it may seem like you're an outgoing positive person and easy to talk to.  It basically means that your comfort with everybody is at neutral in the new class.  SO that means you get a fresh start.  Sometimes in the 1st day of class, i just introduce myself to people who sit around me and i get to know their name.  and ask about their major, why they taking this class, how was their summer or winter.  I then talk about their hobbies and try to see if we got any similar interest.  Most important of all is be yourself and don't try to force it too much.  Sometimes talking to someone too much, will annoy the person.  

Sorry if i made the message too long, i like to sometimes repeat or be descriptive.  Hope this helped a bit!"
soc_1426852,socialskills,reddit_comment,320,"I wish I had advice for you, but I don't really. I just wanted to let you know that you're not the only one!

I literally could have written this exact thing myself. (I'm 26F too, even!)

It really sucks because I feel like I have missed out on so many opportunities in life because of my social anxiety. Like I could have been so much further in my career if I wasn't so shy and prefered to be in the background.

I've also never had a boyfriend. And the few friends I have are friends I made in grade school.

I 100% understand people treating you like a baby sister. People avoid cussing and talking about sex, amongst other ""adult"" topics. They call me ""sweet and innocent."" I have never given them any reason to avoid these things, I just come across as sensitive because I keep quiet.

I started taking medication (Lexapro) at the beginning of 2020. I stopped it after a little less than a year because I didn't really see a difference. But I've considered starting it again because looking back, I think it did actually help more than I realized at the time. I had booked a flight to go visit a friend (which got canceled due to covid) and I was more social with my coworkers during the time that I was on meds.

I've also noticed recently that texting is so much easier for me than talking is. So maybe you need to find someone who likes to text. I tend to write multiple paragraphs when I text people. It's hard to find people that can match that energy, but even if people can't, at least it gives me a social outlet/some exposure therapy and helps people see that there's more to my personality than just ""the quiet girl.""

Not sure if any of that makes sense or helps at all, but yeah."

But then your doubt creeps in and you start making excuses: ""That's lame,"" ""They don't want to talk about work,"" ""That's just small talk."" And you don't say anything. But if someone comes up to you and says ""Hey, what do you do for a living?"" You're grateful they're talking to you and happy to tell them about yourself.
Most people are like this. They enjoy conversation--that's why their at a SOCIAL EVENT in the first place--but are uncomfortable starting one with someone new. You then get it two people standing in a room, both wanting to talk to each other, and neither saying anything. Or people talking only to their friends, and never meeting anyone new. By putting yourself out there and starting a conversation, your doing the other person a favor, not inconveniencing them. They'll usually be grateful for it in the same way your are when someone approaches you."

soc_945162,socialskills,reddit_comment,536,"I’m all for quiet people in conversations. I used to be quiet, but in a bad way. People could tell I was socially anxious because of the fast way I talked and my flighty nonverbal gestured. I would never acknowledge it though and I would get asked why I was quiet a lot.

Over the past few years I have flipped the tables and now I’m usually one of the louder/energetic ones, but I still listen to others and try to involve people to make them feel comfortable and quell their anxiety with nonverbal gestures and affirmation. Most of the times it works, but the times it doesn’t is when their mind is somewhere else because they’re dealing with something.

I believe it’s important to ask yourself what you want out of the conversation/situation you are in. If you are forcefully in a conversation you don’t want to be in then it’s up to you and your rules on how you handle it, but if it’s a conversation that you want to be actively/passively involved in then it’s important to affirm others just as they try to affirm you.

If you are quiet and giving nonverbal gestures/smiles to affirm them then that’s great. When you do decide to speak is positively reinforcing what the conversation/interaction is about? If it is then great, I can almost guarantee you they won’t ask you why you are quiet if you affirm them nonverbally.

If you don’t affirm others the way they affirm you (if they aren’t affirming you then you need to let them know best how to do so, which may mean saying how to in a sentence or two) then they are carrying the conversation/interaction if it is one that you are passively/actively involved in which isn’t fair on your part. They may ask you why are you quiet/other ways to break the ice. I’ll agree that some people do this to make themselves feel better, but a majority do it to try and find how they can affirm you. I don’t know you and if you do this, but I’ve been socially anxious and seen socially anxious people talk fast, look closed off, and fidget. Both people are dancing around the subject of the anxiety, and they may be looking for you to address it, or pull them out of it by sparking up conversation (although there’s better ways to)

I guess if I had to summarize what I’ve been saying I’d say that it’s reasonable to expect a level of affirmation from both parties if you both are active/passive in the conversation. If you don’t address the reason they ask you you’re quiet then it is sort of like projection to think that it’s because of them trying to make themselves feel better.

Ever since I’ve worked on my nonverbals the amount of times I’ve been asked why I’m quiet has significantly dropped. Another hot take is that the same people that are loud are also socially anxious, and they need to affirmed as well before they act less loud around you. I believe when I use nonverbals with these people it calms them and they don’t feel the need to ask why I’m quiet."
soc_22351,socialskills,reddit_comment,192,"It sounds to me like they're pretty unhappy with the job, or it's possible they just don't like communicating a lot while they do it. Whatever the case, not really reacting and only responding with ""yes"" and ""no"" is sort of a universal signal for ""please stop talking to me"" (or ""I'm having a really shitty day,"" or both).

It sounds like these are people who aren't really looking to be social; there's not really anything you can do about that. I would try to keep relatively quiet, do your job, and not get in anyone's way. From what you've described, that's probably what they prefer, and they might become more comfortable with you and open up to you more over time. They might also just not really want anything to do with you, and just want to get through the workday and get home. It's a depressing way to live life, but plenty of people do it; there's nothing you can do but accept it and move on.

tl;dr: I don't think it's your fault, they just aren't interested in socializing. Accept it, do your job, and hope for the best."
soc_840082,socialskills,reddit_comment,139,"Hey there. Maybe you should bring up the topic in a tactful manner. Most people get caught in their own versions of normal. For you, texting, calling, and checking up on people are all what you consider to be normal. Sounds like for them, they are just used to each other's company.  


Maybe this is just their normal and being socially actively with others is just not something that they think about often.   


I wouldn't say that all of your friendships will fade away but they will change over time. Whether or not you stay friends is up to you and doesn't really have much to do to how your parents' social lives are. If you don't want your parents' future to be your future, just keep being socially active and stay friends/make new ones as time goes on."
soc_352183,socialskills,reddit_comment,600,"How's it going, Blackpixels. I decided to do a little research on this question you posed. Here's an article that I found.
https://www.payscale.com/career-news/2013/10/making-eye-contact-with-your-boss-may-backfire

Very interesting read, but I'd like to talk a little bit about one point the writer made.

&gt; Eye Contact May Signal Dominance
&gt; 
&gt; Another point highlighted in this study is that trying to maintain eye contact may come across as dominant or possibly hostile. Staring into somebody else’s eyes as you speak may cause you to come across as pushy or intrusive, instead of as a great communicator.

Everyone interprets these things differently, and I know for certain that I interpret body language differently than I did in the past. Eye contact may not make me feel uncomfortable anymore, but there have been times when I've been made uncomfortable by eye contact that conveyed negative energy.

I was talking to my friend I while ago. The conversation was upbeat, we were both smiling. He wasn't maintaining eye contact as well as me, and he was looking off into the distance a lot - especially while he was talking. At one point, I took over the conversation by telling an anecdote. I was engaging with him through eye contact and utilizing hand gestures while I told my story. All of a sudden, he decided to attempt my level of eye contact. Maybe he was trying to see if he could get me to break eye contact, I'm not sure. He stares directly into my eyes for about 30 seconds, completely blank faced. He didn't even blink. It was creepy, and seemed a little hostile. I ignored it, and continued to engage him with powerful eye contact and positive body language. Eventually he was unable to continue eye contact with me, and broke his weird stare. This is a great example of ""hostile"" eye contact that conveys negative energy.

Yes, my friend did eventually become intimidated by my eye contact and broke his stare. However - this was not a reflection of the energy conveyed, it was a reflection of his confidence level. Keep in mind that being intimidating and being hostile are completely different. Being intimidating reflects your personality, being hostile reflects your mood. Very different energies were being conveyed through our body language. I was smiling and using my hands while I talked. He was sitting with his hands by his side, blank faced, and creepily staring into my eyes.

So my main point is that eye contact with your boss is only creepy if you make it creepy. If your boss comes up to you and says ""How was your weekend, Mr. Pixels?"" and you stare him straight in the eyes with your hands by your sides and no expression on your face, and say ""It was fine, me and my wife went to the beach for the weekend."" he might feel like you're angry at him or in a hostile mood. He might even just walk away. Instead, when he approaches you with the same sentence, say ""Great, me and my wife drove down to the beach and we had an amazing time,"" using hand gestures while you talk, and then said ""How was your weekend, sir?"" Now you're engaged in a positive conversation with your boss, and the last thing on his mind is ""this guy is trying to be hostile/intimidate me."" If you're concerned that strong eye contact with your boss might be too intense, just aim for maintaining eye contact 60-70% of the time. Briefly break gaze now and then, wait a few seconds, and then return to eye contact."
soc_518108,socialskills,reddit_comment,289,"I can totally understand how you feel. I also have that “beta” feeling when hanging with my guy friends. Well, it used to be really bad, to the point I just wouldn’t hang out with guys. I had to finally see a therapist. There I found out it was because of the way I was raised by my father and my step-father that caused me to be “afraid” of other men. I’m a big guy (6’2” 220lbs) but I’ve never felt like a big person. 

What I’ve learned to do around other men or my guy friends is to be as big as I actually am, and don’t be afraid to be myself. That’s what helps me. I know everyone is different. And, when it comes to conversations, my therapist suggested that I shouldn’t be afraid to not have an interest in what the subject is, just say “I don’t really follow football I’m more of an extreme sports fan.”

If you’re low on funds, I say it’s okay and your guy friend should understand. What I like to do because it’s a whole lot cheaper than going out to a bar, is to pick up a six pack or a bottle of wine and chill out in the yard and talk shit until we run out of beer. Sometimes when we don’t have anything to talk about for a few min and it starts to feel a little awkward, I don’t try to come up with something to talk about, we just cruise quietly until something comes up. Like, no stress. 

Anyway, this is all broken up. I hope you understand what I’m trying to say. Hang in there! You are not alone with the way you feel. "
soc_1430314,socialskills,reddit_comment,205,"If you really want a relationship, you can call them out. If they want to work on it with you that’s great😊 If they dismiss it then even more reason not to talk.

I also think it’s okay to just be quiet and let the relationship dissolve on its own. Up to you.


Edit after reviewing some of the other comments:

Definitely bring up the situation to your friends - if they tell you that you are being desperate then drop them, unfortunately they do not deem you as important and it’s a waste of time to stick around and be a doormat.
On the other hand, they might not have realized that about themselves and will change their efforts moving forward.

Also, I’ve seen some comments that say people are busy and have lives; this is absolutely true. People have priorities and sometimes you’re not going to be one of the priorities (especially if they have things like school, marriage, and/or children). You don’t have to cut these friends out of your life, but you also don’t have to “wait” for them to have free time. During those seasons/periods in your relationship take time to focus on yourself or even expand your friend group."
soc_931603,socialskills,reddit_comment,164,"That’s understandable, and not at all uncommon. I have had the same pattern in various scenarios, of allowing something to go on for a long time, before one day just having had enough of that. Seems to me you’re either at that point or rapidly nearing it. Where the perpetuation of the current dynamic no longer seems easier to deal with than the unknown of what might happen if you were to make changes in life. 
I cannot tell you what’s the right choice going forward, is for you. Only you can decide that, but no matter what you choose I’d encourage you to remember you’re never locked into a pattern or dynamic. Just because you chose something once doesn’t mean you have to stick to that. The present moment is always the perfect starting point for change. :) Thus there are no wrong choices in life. Every choice made enrich us with experience and help build the foundation for the next choice. :)"
soc_1057466,socialskills,reddit_comment,167,"&gt; I really don't understand how they came to that conclusion 

Did you try asking them that question when they brought it up to you?  Or did you decide to make a bunch of guesses about it instead?

As for how this relates to OP's situation... In the case that the other people tell you that they think you're being rude, it's a misunderstanding that you can easily clear up.  I don't see the problem there.

People will misinterpret things sometimes.  It's an easy fix if they tell you.

The real problem is when you base all of your actions on an incorrect assumption.  OP could be making himself upset for no reason.  This is why my advice to him is to stop reading minds.  

But... if you're going to assume something *anyway*, why not assume that everything is fine until proven wrong... instead of assuming everything is wrong until proven that it's fine?  One of those assumptions will be more helpful for you than the other."
soc_372490,socialskills,reddit_comment,219,"Guy here. 

A certain amount of shy and passive is not a bad thing. It really depends on the person and their tastes. 

But being proactive about who you want in your life isn't a bad thing either. I pursued my wife the moment I fell in love with her, and we're happily married with a 1 year old. 

The biggest thing, in my opinion, to making a relationship work isn't who makes the first move. It can be you, it can be him, often it's a mix of both. As you said, you turned down the other guys because they didn't care about what you hold important, and that right there is the key thing. Without a connection of shared interests and passions, finding a way to connect as friends even if the romantic angle fails, you're in for trouble. 

So my advice would be don't worry so much about finding a ""boyfriend"", make a connection that could become that level down the road. 


As for Prom, come on, it's prom! Take a chance, see if there's a guy you like who isn't going with anyone, and ask him! Even if he says no, are you worse off than you were before? 

Love is itself a risk, and sometimes risks should be taken in pursuit of it. :)"
soc_1682159,socialskills,reddit_comment,436,"I don’t see what’s idealistic about it I included steps and precautions in the event it’s not going as you would think. The comment is more of a process or outline than a reflection or an example. I’m a big believer in energy so carrying around the attitude that she isn’t going to be interested will consequently make her uninterested because she can smell the low self esteem oozing through your sweat glands. I’m unsure if you misinterpreted the comment though or if I didn’t communicate the process clearly because you say you’ll most likely be ghosted anyway but the whole point of building the rapport is to incentivize further engagement over text message. Texting is a whole different ball game and hard to learn since it’s very counter intuitive which is why I offered further advice if OP makes it that far. I agree that shooting for girls you already are familiar with is a much higher success rate but there have been a few very rare instances in my life where I saw a woman that intrigued me and the only option is a “cold approach”. If I didn’t act, then the window of opportunity would close and I may never see that person again. The approach is what you make of it and the energy you bring to the table. If the vibe is right, people enjoy a conversation anywhere, anytime, boy, girl, old, young, rich, poor, doesn’t matter if you come with the right energy. Energy that you can only get with practice Having casual conversation is in our DNA. Sure, the cold approaches are less successful but it’s up to you to receive the rejection with grace. This method is not pushy, does not impose your will on others, and leaves the door wide open for her so she never has reason to turn defensive against you which is where the hurtful words start to come from. Most women are very empathetic and if you do it right will let you down easy and even walk away happy with the experience and you should walk away happy too. Both of you got to save face and have a fun little interaction. You get to live with no regret, sharpened your toolkit a little and she gets to know that she looks really good that day. Now maybe you think it’ll be weird if you see her again but it’s the same deal it’s only weird if you make it weird. Carry the right energy and everything will be fine, you might even make a friend if that’s what you’re looking for."
soc_12381,socialskills,reddit_comment,712,"If you have a lot of free time and your mind isn't occupied 24/7 with work and personal things, then you can definitely try some of the tips below and watch the results. 

If you're super busy, friends will almost always be at a distance and think of you as ""that busy guy"", people will rarely invite you to things, and some people will even feel bad for taking up your time with conversations and such. 

You can never be close with a lot of people all at the same time. Acquaintances are great, because they let you ""see"" people without being obliged to care about them, leaving you with just the right amount of time to judge them and determine how useful and interesting they can be for you. Optimally (IMO), you should try to be close with 3-5 people in your life, and keep others as acquaintances.

The best way to get someone closer to you is to have them trust you, and the best way to have someone trust you is to trust him/her first...or at least pretend to. 

Let's say you want to get closer to a guy named Mike. Approach him when you two are alone and use open, slightly shy body language. 
""Mike, I know you don't know me very well, but if you don't mind I just wanna ask you about something. You seem like a smart guy."" ....bring up an issue, or make one up, something that Mike will know about. Make him feel smart for a minute, look into his eyes when you talk to him, nod vigorously when he says anything remotely substantial. Act thankful for any advice. During this conversation, Mike will either say vague things in response to you, or give you really great ideas and even relate personal experience to your question. If he is vague, he probably isn't interested in either the question or you as a person. If he tries hard - he most likely cares. If he finishes with ""Yeah man, you can always talk to me, I'm on fb like all day"" or something similar, then you've just started deepening your friendship. **Always** return that statement if it ever comes up. 

Another good way to make people like you, and want to be around you/get to know you better is to simply please them with something like a tasty snack. Show up to a hangout with some chocolate chip cookie dough and bake your group of ""acquaintances"" some cookies. Cost: about $3.00, and you're not even using your own oven. Result: fucking everyone is having an orgasm in their mouth, and they know that you put it there. Their thoughts: ""damn, throwawayseduction is a damn nice guy. I should get to know him better."" Just make sure you know how to make those cookies perfect. 

Lastly, if you and your acquaintances indulge in alcohol and especially weed, sharing the high or drunk experience with them in a good way will almost always result in closer friendships. Over the course of this year I can confidently say that I have acquired at least 5 good friends simply by calling them up out of the blue and saying ""hey man, I just got some dank-ass elephant purps, wanna come smoke with me and hang out? I know a beautiful spot by the city river"". This way, the drugs make your new buddy(s) feel good, and all you have to do is sit back and let them associate the pleasant experience with your presence. 

**TL;DR be Good Guy Greg long enough to make people like you, trust you, and open up to you. Even if you stop feeding them cookies and smoking them out, the relationship will still be there.**

Edit: Thought of another important detail. One thing that makes people instantly feel closer to you is if you offer major help - like a ride to the airport, moving stuff, yard work, basically anything that wouldn't cost you too much, but would be reasonable to not expect reimbursement for. Kind of like the cookies. Politely declining repayment seals the deal. You are now a great guy, the person you just helped is majorly stoked, and in all likelihood, he/she will want to hang out in the future. "

On a deeper level, take an honest look at your behavior and see if you can tell- what was going on underneath?  What was, exactly, going on that caused the reaction? 1- the trigger. The guys slaughtering you, the girl seeing that, something else, etc. 2- what was it about you that chose that response? Overreaction? Felt belittled and wanted to show them how tough you are?

The people interested in getting better will try to put in the effort but you can't assume that everyone has the same skillset.

soc_664796,socialskills,reddit_comment,212,"You can't do nothing and expect people to come to you. Practically there are a few ways to start a conversation at work. The first is anything observational. These include weather, anything related new to the workplace, anything like that really. This is very powerful because it shows you being very relatable. Over time there is a phenomena called the mere exposure effect where the more often you see or talk to someone the more comfortable they will be around you. Use this to your advantage.   
Another way to start a conversation is something functional. This is things like advice, asking for help in the workspace, anything like that. These conversations don't need to be long as long as you are consistent. Also, if you can make an inside joke with any of them, you are definitely in.   
There is also a psychological effect that comes into play too when you do this. It is called social proof. This says when people around you are laughing and having fun you makes you more credible and likable without any observers personally knowing you. This is exactly how you can be more approachable. If you can get a few co workers around you having fun, laughing, etc more people will come up to you."
soc_1785818,socialskills,reddit_comment,215,"Yeah I don't think you need me to tell you this - but no that definitely \*does not\* sound like a show of true remorse from her.

Sometimes people are just too absorbed in their own feelings and discomforts - and too emotionally immature to really find enough of a healthy perspective around their feelings to incorporate an operating awareness of other peoples feelings.

Sometimes its pathological. Sometimes its just a phase in their lives - and after destroying alot of friendships and career opportunities they hit a sort of rock-bottom and realize their life will suck if they can't empathize with people. Sometimes those people come back years later and apologize - but its healthiest to move on with your life assuming they never will.

It sounds like you maybe need to sorta go separate ways from her, at least for awhile. It's up to you if you want to really try to give her an explanation or not (if you think she is really capable of receiving that info without lashing out at you).

You can definitely find activities to do with your friends that don’t involve drinking, but you also should learn how to have a good time if all your buddies ask you to go out to a bar with them. Please *don’t* let yourself be the moody wallflower moping while everyone else is chatting and having a good time just because you don’t enjoy their beverage of choice. If you can manage to go out to a few happy hours/other drinking events, that’s a great way to meet new people who you can *later* invite out to a non-drinking activity. 

Here are some general tips for coping if you’re ever invited to an event where alcohol will be involved (because they’re still great opportunities for socializing you shouldn’t pass up!):

-Consider that the vast majority of people don’t actually care that you’re not drinking too. Your friends might tease you a bit about it, but it’s not something people actually take all that seriously. They’ll learn to drop it and respect your choice if they’re rational human beings. It’s wayyy less weird than you think to hang out at a bar and just order a water or soda when everyone else is drinking- I know plenty of people who do this, either because they prefer not to drink period or because they occasionally like to opt out. Totally fine, no normal person at the bar should harass you for it.

-If you want to end the teasing about your drinking habits entirely, maybe find a nice, mild drink with low alcohol content that you can keep with you to sip slowly. White wines are a great option, since you mentioned you don’t like beer- maybe try a glass of something on the sweeter side, like Riesling or Pinot Grigio. Rosé works too. If you’re at a cocktail place, try getting a frozen margarita or ask the bartender for a lighter recommendation (sometimes they’ll even be able to make cocktails into mocktails upon request). One drink of any of those options definitely won’t get you drunk or even tipsy, and if you’ve eaten before, chances are you will feel 0 alcoholic effects whatsoever.

-Just relax and mingle without worrying about what people think of your drinking! Like I mentioned, chances are no one cares nearly as much about you abstaining as you seem to think. I have a good friend who doesn’t drink at all, and I drink rather a lot— we still like to go out to clubs on the weekend and have an amazing time dancing together with our other friends. She doesn’t let it prevent her from enjoying the night, and no one gives her a hard time about it. I’m glad that she doesn’t let everyone else’s choices bother her because it means we get to spend more time together! I’m sure your friends will feel the same way about you. 

Take the initiative yourself and come up with some things to invite your new friends to that don’t involve drinking— maybe a movie night at your place, a camping/hiking trip, a visit to a local carnival or festival, or just lunch at a casual restaurant."
soc_360645,socialskills,reddit_comment,223,"This happened to me once and I finally asked the guy and he said he only thought of me as a friend. On one hand, it hurt like hell, because I didn't just want to be his ""friend""; didn't want to watch him go after other girls/ask me advice about other girls. On the other hand, I had my answer. So i decided to end the friendship. That was so difficult, because we saw each other daily and really enjoyed each other's company and could talk for hours. You have to decide if your friendship with her/watching her with other guys is more important than your own mental well-being. I understand totally your not wanting to bring up the subject with her because her actually saying the words, ""I don't think of you that way"" could cut like a knife, never mind change your relationship for good. Maybe you could talk around the subject sometime when the two of you are alone with you asking her what kind of girl would be good for you? See how she reacts to that. If she describes someone who is completely different from her, you may have your answer there. But if she describes someone just like herself, you could say, ""oh, you mean someone like you?"" and then see where the conversation goes from there."
soc_1370306,socialskills,reddit_comment,155,"Its difficult to approach a stranger, be friendly, make them feel safe and all if you haven't done it much. But maybe you can put yourself in her position. Sitting alone in the cafeteria trying not to feel/look alone. Would be pretty good or interesting at least if someone came by, sit and said ""hi i dont think we've met before i'm ..."".

Just dont try too hard to look good or interesting because that usually makes you look weird. I'm not gonna say just be you bro! but dont be too different than your everyday self. Get to know her a little bit, ask about her day and if she says anything that interests you keep talking about that and branch it.

And if things dont go too well dont worry about it you tried and that is better then most would do. Remember you get better the more you do it. Good luck"
soc_858661,socialskills,reddit_comment,625,"Here's the problem: First of all... it seems your entire generation has grown up in the age of technology, and you guys don't seem to get out and do as much face-to-face activities or make actual contact like your parents did when we were young. Dude... you guys are making meeting people online and calling people 'friends' many of whom you will never even meet in person! Once you take away school, sports or other activities... what have you got? Can you walk next door; up the street or around the corner and hang out with that so-called 'friend' you met on Facebook or some online gaming room? Therefore... when you add a person like yourself who's not necessarily a social butterfly to start with to the current mix, well it's only natural that you would have a problem with social skills. Now please don't get me wrong because I am not criticizing you for being the quiet type, and I actually dig quiet people. Believe that. The only point I'm trying to make here is that you are going to have to stop and understand just how much you have delayed your social growth by spending the amount of time that you already have in the house and on games.

One of the greatest lessons you can ever learn is to stop worrying about how to start a conversation or whether or not people are going to find whatever you have to say interesting or not. Be yourself! Just be yourself. Make yourself walk right up to people and say hi... then talk. Just talk. Talk about whatever comes to mind be it some current event; schools, goals, cities or certain events around town... just whatever dude... and above all.. learn how to listen. Listen with true genuine interest, and if the other person attempts to tell you about something you know nothing or very little about, then ask questions. A lot of people LOVE to talk about their work, studies, interests or passions, and YOU should talk about yours. Talk and find out where the common ground lies. The more you step out there, the more comfortable you will become.

Now... one more thing. I want you to look deep within and acknowledge to yourself the reason(s) why you believe you're quiet. It could be a natural inherited personality trait... or.. it could be the result of some childhood incident... or... it could be a matter of your level of self-esteem, insecurity or a lack of self-confidence... or it could be that you're still in the midst of learning things about yourself and feel that no one would understand. It could be any number of things, but you and only YOU know the answer(s). This is why I encourage you to try a little harder to touch base with the you inside to get to the root of whatever it is. Honesty with self will definitely help you along the way during this process. Again... your quiet nature could simply be no more than a personality trait and there's nothing wrong with that because ""the DNA doesn't lie and God doesn't make mistakes. He just makes different types of people. :) Just know that you are not some total disinteresting person. You're just a young person who is learning self and life who is also part of the high-tech generation... and I get that.  Now you think about all that I've said and speak with your mom about it. I normally encourage a young people to talk to both mom and dad, but for some reason I am more inclined to push **you** in mom's direction because I believe she will be more sensitive and receptive to your unique set of needs.

Peace"
soc_1353647,socialskills,reddit_comment,120,"There's a lot of stuff that comes naturally to us that doesn't necessarily serve us well. That's the whole idea behind self-improvement! Of course you should only try to change those things that you think will ultimately make you happier, and that's for you to decide.

Also knowing your interests is important, and there's nothing wrong with pursuing those interests and seeking out like-minded people to share those with. 

I get what you're saying about 'performative,' but at the same time many social conventions fall into that category, including basic manners. We learn them and make them part of our persona because they provide value and generally make our lives better.

Nothing wrong with getting out of our comfort zone!"

soc_1697312,socialskills,reddit_comment,333,"I'm just going to answer your questions, as you have very particular ones. 

**I have problems keeping conversations and starting them.** 

* Start with basic stuff (Essentially getting a gist of what kind of person they are) 
* Hey! How's it going?, Where are you from?, How's class (Follow-up with what you thought about class, helps the other person warm up to you). If you have different classes, then talk about those things too. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I don't have many friends; I want to start to make new ones but idk how to approach people.** 

* Just walk up to them, and wave at them or just drop a Hey! That's pretty much all you need to do. Most often, people are happy to talk to you. 
* When you talk to new people, use the Questioning Method, which is essentially just picking out buzzwords from their statements and framing another question out of it. 

For example, 

Person X: I love horse-riding, I've been doing it for almost 6 years! 

You: Oh! Where did you learn Horse-Riding? (Follow up with random questions about Horse-Riding) 

&amp;#x200B;

**I worry that i may look like a creep, or an asshole.** 

* Don't get too personal at the get-go, and just don't stare or be rude. Just go with the flow.  
* Saying Hey! to someone isn't creepy, I like to think of it as a way to acknowledge someone's presence. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Is talking to someone because i overheard that they have similar interests acceptable?**

* Yeah, but let them broach the subject. Don't just go up to them and say, Hey! you like doing X right? (This assumes that you heard about their interests from someone else)
* If you are sitting close by and overheard their conversation, then you could jump in by saying Hey! I just overheard your conversation and you mentioned you're interested in X activity. 

Hope this helps! I had the same problem when I started college, and this is what I've realized."
soc_1373649,socialskills,reddit_comment,398,"I'd interpret this mostly as expressing a desire and availability to talk to you but without really requiring a response.  They are inviting you to respond if you are interested in talking, but not trying to pressure you to talk at the time if you are busy/not in the mood.  It doesn't require a response, so it leaves it up to you to continue the conversation or not.

As to your response, assuming you do want to talk, you could probably respond with pretty much anything that shows interest in conversing as well.  Could be the same topic or something totally different.  If they just want to talk for the sake of talking you can really throw around pretty much any random topics until something sticks for bit, and if it putters out throw out more random topics.  I think the thing to keep in mind is to realize that they are also involved in maintaining the conversation as much as you are.  As long as you say something, and they are also interested in continuing to talk, they will find some way to keep things going.  You pretty much only have to avoid showing complete apathy towards maintaining the conversation (à la the classic one word responder) and beyond that pretty much anything goes.

As for more specific ideas, as the other commenter said you could talk about what you are doing, or relate to what they are doing.  But equally if you have no ideas you could probably just ask ""Cool, how is the movie so far?"" or ""Oh nice, what kind of wine was it?"".  That sends it back to them to either ask their own question or maybe give you some extra details beyond what exactly was asked which you could then react to or ask more questions about.  But as mentioned pretty much anything goes as long as you throw something out that can be responded to: ""Sounds fun.  How's the rest of your week been?"", ""Jealous.  Hey, did you hear about x event/news?"". You could even maybe go for a playful jab, something like ""A whole bottle!  You're a monster!"".  I'd pretty much only try to avoid a plain ""Cool"" or something since that doesn't really show you are interested in talking further.  But if they are really desperate to talk though even that might work.  Something is always better than nothing."

I still suck at talking to people, and it's taken years of personal work overcoming my poopy self-image. If anything, being moderately attractive might help people overlook social mistakes sometimes?

Things you can learn from this - You should not have let your confidence hinge on the behaviour of others. You should have tried to be jolly and talk to as many people as you could and not just the one guy. You should have tried to initiate and make contribution to the group conversation."

Yes, mismatched libidos are common because everyone is different.

&gt;Be it from a male or female perspective.

That's not a sentence 

&gt;Everybody wants sex.

The ace community (asexuals) would disagree with you.

&gt;You talk like you never had a relationship before

Really?

&gt;has had a bad experience regarding your lack of sex drive.

Not at all. I've been the one with the higher sex drive. Although, people who've had a ""lack of sex drive"" or a lower sex drive are probably the ones the OP should be getting advice from.

But I have had friends with low (or no (in the case of asexuals)) sex drive and there's this idea that they need to change and the person with the higher sex drive doesn't.

A straight person has little or no sexual attraction towards the same sex. A gay person has little or no attraction towards the opposite sex. Should we find a way to ""cure"" the straight person and the gay person and make everyone bisexual, or should we celebrate difference and accept people have different libidos?

The OP should be trying to find ways to make their libidos more compatible, not trying to find ways make his gf have more sex with him."
soc_1404230,socialskills,reddit_comment,220,"I get it. I sometimes feel the same way and what makes it worse is the feeling of desperation, both internally and externally, that aggravates over time.

Internally : you detect that you're not what you used to be, you compare yourself to that apparent ""better and more social"" version of yourself and then start to feel less. You get caught up on a loop where you try to improve but what all of this effort and thinking do is just worsening and lessening your social battery.

Externally : You feel like people are noticing and are judging or looking down upon you. Again, efforts to change, excessive thinking and energy starts to drastically decrease. Once again, a vicious circle.

You know what, none of this thoughts are real. There's nothing wrong with you. You feel like that other version of you was better, because you were feeling better. You're the same person, probably tired from others life events and at the very first notice, you start questioning yourself, ending up in a negative loop that drains away all of your energy.

Trust me, it gets better, you only need to catch yourself when you are going down this draining mental loop and try some mindfulness techniques, ralaxation, mantras, etc...whatever works for you, try and see.

soc_1566893,socialskills,reddit_comment,363,"*Without being creepy* maybe go to a coffee shop or bar and get a drink and a book or something and just listen to other folks convos. Don’t be a weirdo but just let it wash over you and try to take in how the successful small talkers keep convos rolling smoothly. 

Like say you are standing in line and you hear a couple friends bump into each other, you don’t need to remember what they said or spy on them but like just follow for patterns. This is defs a slightly creepy way to learn even if you are not a stalker lol but you’ve missed out on some part of you socializing education I think. 

Also one really good tip: pretend you are interested. Feel excited to see them, or pretend that you are. It makes it easier to actually be interested if you feel like you are, even if it’s fake. If they have a pet or a child, that is ALWAYS -a good (if potentially boring for you) convo starter or continuer. 

When I worked in a bunch of different offices and stuff doing consulting, I would keep little notes on folks in my phone if I knew I wouldn’t see them super often. It made it easier for me not to forget which face went with which name before the time of zoom calls. 

So like I’d remember that Tiffany has a gorgeous dog that eats rocks and needs surgery because she’s a doofus and won’t stop eating rocks. Adnan likes to kayak and has a campervan that always needs repairs. 

Whatever works for you. Like if you can’t trust your working memory in the moment, create a memory file that you can check before you have to go to events with loads of folks. I mean Facebook kinda does this for you with friends but if you don’t have it or they aren’t people you’d have as social media friends then this works. :)

You can also just tell them you are really awkward at small talk but are genuinely happy to see them and they’ll often do the extra work to keep the convo flowing. :)"
soc_1716164,socialskills,reddit_comment,455,"Hi OP, I wanted to reply because I completely understand where you’re coming from. Idk how you act in these situations when you hang out with these people, but you seem like you’re socially aware and not off-putting. Sometimes, it’s just about finding your people and not necessarily anything you’re doing wrong. Some people click right away and want to hang out, other times the other party just doesn’t see it. It may very well be that they do enjoy your company, but not enough for them to go out of their way to initiate. It may hurt in the moment to realize this, but this is a big world and there are people out there that will appreciate you and make time for you. 

Whether you want to continue to initiate hanging out with these people or not is up to you. There’s no right answer—if you feel like it makes you happy, keep doing it. If you feel like it’s a waste of time and that it should be a 2 way street, then it’s also perfectly fine to stop initiating. 

I’m currently working a temporary job (1 year contract) that takes a lot of my time. I spend a lot of time with the same people at work, and I’m in a new place away from family and friends, so like many people I do seek out some kind of community where I am. I had a similar situation—there was a coworker I was trying to initiate hanging out with, inviting them to lunch, etc. Usually they were busy, which I understood. But then I knew they would hang out with other coworkers on the side. When I asked one day to hang out and grab lunch, I got a last min text inviting me to join the group. I declined because I had already made plans and it was really last minute. But the invite felt forced. Like hey I’ll send you the address if you want to come. 

There is nothing inherently wrong with what this person did. But after a while, I realized it was just me asking to hang out. Even if we get along at work, she isn’t that interested in being close friends or taking the initiative. And that’s ok. Not everyone will be the right fit, but friend groups and situations change. You mentioned being in grad school, which is temporary. I had a similar situation in grad school, also felt that while I seemed to be well liked in a large group setting, no one initiated hanging out with me. I didn’t fit the culture. But life moves on and you will find your people and people who truly will make time for you."

soc_1273168,socialskills,reddit_comment,583,"Sorry for the para! It’s mostly just me reflecting, and giving out opinions no one asked for lol. It’s up to you if you wish to read it…


Thank you! Even I get attracted def, but I try to remind myself.. the thing is, it’s perfectly normal… teens have high sex drive which can lead to them having high expectations and a strong urge to get into a relationship… which causes them to act “irrational” and “biased” so they can get sex quick (like being a creep, asking for nudes etc)… but it’s not how they truly are..

I think everyone’s beliefs, personality etc are good in someway and these behaviours (being creep etc, making bad decisions) are purely a bias (due to our hormones + inexperience )  (that’s why we learn and cringe about ourselves when we get older)

I personally wouldn’t call myself sharp, this trait… is more like, I am extremely self aware, as in, 99% of us realise what we were like 10 years later and “cringe” and realise how stupid we were, it is because when we observe a change in mindset (as we grow older), we can easily see how “different” we are from our younger years and then “cringe” on it… the difference is, I am extremely self aware compared what 99% of people realise how they used to think AFTER their thinking gets changed… they realise how they were “so stupid” and made “bad decisions “ because their mindset changed and they can see their old mindset in clarity…
I, am aware of what kind of person I am, I can look at my “current mental state” objectively and know who I am… do you know what “you” 30 years later (at 61) thinks of you right now? That guy must’ve changed in traits and will notice your “flaws and strengths. What kind of person you truly are? Why do you behave like X or Y or suddenly feel Z when this happens? I try to answer each and every question like this to get as much self awareness WITHOUT judging myself… otherwise it becomes delusions and insecurity… getting to know your own nature… that’s what brought me to my opinions etc because I have likely questioned everything about it…

As we get to learn that these approaches don’t work at all and our hormones calm down…And get a feel that we were “weird” back then and become a lot more educated and mature (like you)…and relate to younglings  and understand them

I like to believe there’s more to my life than sex (I wish to live such a way that I’m getting more happiness and dopamine by what I’m doing compared to things like weed, drinking, sex etc… it’s my way to live by and I’ve been successful so far, hopefully in future too)

so I have a strong belief that I will never seek out anything just for sex  (like going on tinder, paying for it etc) or drink to numb myself etc I would rather wait for a companion I am great with, where sex is not everything but a bonus. This is why I haven’t been a creep, nor rushing into relationship with people online or irl …
My belief is purely my belief and I don’t degrade anyone of my friends, strangers for having contradictory beliefs. 

After my depression due to my monotonous life, these are the new beliefs I introduced to myself which has changed me for the better."

Write a daft line on the bio thing and swipe right to everyone. 

Anytime you get a match you can practice talking to people. They swiped right on you too so they are interested in being talked to, so say something. 

Hey how are you? Is safe and tame. But do it and see what they say. 

Make a comment about one of their pictures or bio. This is an observation and more commonly used to strike up small talk in bars, coffe shops, supermarket, bus etc. Nice shirt, I love that sports team/band/film. Your dress is pretty. That photo of you climbing that bridge is cool, I'd love to do that etc etc 

Outright make a joke as your first opening, or ask/say something that gets them to give you an answer that isn't yes or no, whatever you think of, the more random the better. 

You're asking for help deciding what to have for dinner, where should you go on holiday next year, which starship you would prefer to have a go on, it literally doesn't matter. 

Last and high risk/high reward is open with something sexual. Most likely will not generate much but it might strike up a conversation, most probably won't though. 

There's an improv technique where you constantly say yes, then add something or agree and amplify. Do that. 

Don't say what you think she wants to hear, say what you think, feel or makes you laugh. Your goal should be to have fun conversations. 

If they don't reciprocate, don't take it personally. Move on.

Like a lot of time on forums like this I see posts about how to help people become more talkative or more socially acceptable, but on the flip side, if people that are more outward socially, learned about the fears of people that are generally socially exclusive, shouldn’t we also embrace people to talk to quiet kids or try and get them into the group?. Like not only are you somewhat helping deal with their problem, they also might not seem so stuck up anymore. Theirs no gaurentee a quietly socially awkward kid is gonna go up and start making friends or start being a good social butterfly so to speak right off the bat, and even if he tries, the group he tries to talk to might still reject him socially only driving him further into social rejection.

People with different techniques, efforts, styles, sometimes I try to talk less if it seems like people are getting annoyed with me, talk more if it feels like a conversation is staled at one point, asking about the other person, being genuine,  or talk about myself to much, being mild in disagreement and kind. Be honest. I know this is typical of a losers attitude, “I tried everything and it still isint working”.   But honest to god, I’ve only driven myself further into self hatred and lack of self respect and surely a huge lack of confidence, rarely does any person I talk to like talking to me or establish any kind of friendship. I’ve tried and it sucks. Somtimes I honestly think about what it would be like to end things in life for myself, just because of the way I am. It’s annoying it’s like a bad blood line that should of fated out but still came out. I’ve met people like me, and I get why people don’t like talking to us. I understand why but even with all the effort I put in, to being confident talking, trying to not be weird, people just don’t warm up to me, and the shittiest part about all of it, is that the people I’m around don’t notice that I’m trying or care, no one can tell I’m putting in the effort to include myself and still getting told I’m annoying or to shut up or just plainly being left out of things. 

It sucks a lot because I joined the military in hopes of trying to help restructure myself/my life and the confidence I have. And its honestly only gotten worse. No one I “work” with in the army really like me, and it’s unfortunate because the people who “like “ me are the ones who basically pick on me for being half retarded.

A hard stare right into her eyes then middle finger before walking away works too. An eyeroll and saying ""whatever, __insert bitch's name___"" before walking away can also show her you dont give a shit. 

You could also whip your phone out and record whenever you see her eyeing you/about to walk up to you. Then at least you have evidence and can post it on social media if you want."
soc_902238,socialskills,reddit_comment,191,"It really depends on your exact situation. You're young enough to not necessarily appreciate how much of an impact your circle of friends has on you. Is it possible they've been bringing you down or limiting you in some way that you didn't even realize? There's a saying that you are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with. I'm in my early 40s, and can say that this is most certainly true. Have you had any realizations of what you want to do in your future during the pandemic that are pretty different from what you were thinking before?

Maybe you're introverted and just need the break from people. This has definitley been my situation! :-p

Either way, as long as you don't find yourself being afraid to leave your home and are still comfortable dealing with people in general, then I think you're fine. If you do find yourself not wanting to ever leave your home, then you may be developing Agoraphobia. A lot of people will probably be developing this, in which case reaching out to a counselor of some sort could be beneficial."

As far as brain development goes, the research is very hazy. Some studies say 24-25, some say 30-35, some even say 40. And some studies even say the brain never stops developing. 

At the end of the day, you should get so caught up on age expectations. As long as you are working, making a living, paying the bills/taxes, whatever you do in your free time, and how you live your life is up to you.

Personally, I feel like my ""youth"" is just beginning at 27. Obviously, when I hit my 40's things will slow down. But I might as well enjoy my life while I'm young and not worry about stereotypical ""adult"" things like getting married, having kids, and moving up the corporate ladder. None of those things interest me.

soc_1202545,socialskills,reddit_comment,374,"Well first off I think in terms of the being treated like a gay best friend/friendzone thing, you need to be more decisive. If you've been direct about liking someone and they just sort of ignore and continue on then you have to decide whether you are happy with friendship or not (sounds like you're not) and not necessarily entirely cut the person out but certainly reduce contact down to like acquaintance level being polite if you do happen to see them. If they aren't into when you confess it's probably not going to happen so make the decision then and there about what is best for you. 

It's about self-worth, I think something that is useful for that is to build up some self reliance. I'm not sure if you maybe already do this but going on trips and activities on your own, if you struggle with allowing people to tag along then don't tell them about it, just do it yourself. I know that sounds weird but it's about teaching yourself that you can enjoy life without others, it makes it easier to be stronger in deciding that a person isn't good for you and it's ok to get rid of them because you don't need to have other people around, it's nice but it's a bonus rather than a necessity, and some people are a punishment rather than a bonus. 

When we are more secure with who we are I think it can also change the sort of people we attract (I don't really mean romantically but I suppose that would be the same too). If you're a bit desperate, like many of us are, for people to have around or for a relationship, you're going to inevitably attract people that will try and take advantage of that, to use you for their gain. When you can work on freeing yourself of some of that desperation you take away a lot of that opportunity to be taken advantage of. Of course we will always want people, we are social animals after all but it's just about recognizing that we don't need people that aren't good for us just because they are people, we can do better without that sort of person."
soc_1653304,socialskills,reddit_comment,444,"Yeah, there was some stuff before this that seems to indicate that apathy is considered virtuous, and this one was just the straw that broke the camel's back. I haven't gone beyond it yet. Let me find the other suspect sections for you real quick. Be right back with an edit!

edit: 

&gt;If you would improve, lay aside such reasonings as these: “If I neglect my affairs, I shall not have a maintenance; if I do not punish my servant, he will be good for nothing.” For it were better to die of hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation; and it is better that your servant should be bad than you unhappy.

&gt;Begin therefore with little things. Is a little oil spilled or a little wine stolen? Say to yourself, “This is the price paid for apathy, for tranquillity; and nothing is to be had for nothing.” And when you call your servant, consider that it is possible he may not come at your call; or, if he does, that he may not do what you wish. But it is not at all desirable for him, and very undesirable for you, that it should be in his power to cause you any disturbance.

and:

&gt;As in a voyage, when the ship is at anchor, if you go on shore to get water, you may amuse yourself with picking up a shellfish or a truffle in your way, but your thoughts ought to be bent toward the ship, and perpetually attentive, lest the captain should call, and then you must leave all these things, that you may not have to be carried on board the vessel, bound like a sheep; thus likewise in life, if, instead of a truffle or shellfish, such a thing as a wife or a child be granted you, there is no objection; but if the captain calls, run to the ship, leave all these things, and never look behind. But if you are old, never go far from the ship, lest you should be missing when called for.

and

&gt;With regard to whatever objects give you delight, are useful, or are deeply loved, remember to tell yourself of what general nature they are, beginning from the most insignificant things. If, for example, you are fond of a specific ceramic cup, remind yourself that it is only ceramic cups in general of which you are fond. Then, if it breaks, you will not be disturbed. If you kiss your child, or your wife, say that you only kiss things which are human, and thus you will not be disturbed if either of them dies."

soc_154766,socialskills,reddit_comment,133,"&gt; My problem is that I can't initiate small talk, because I don't know enough to know what they interested in.

So then you figure that part out by asking them probing questions. :P ""What do you like?"" ""Where are you from?"" Look for points of common interest. Ask them about themselves. It takes practice, because since a lot of you here are not accustomed to socializing it's normal to be left with a ""blank"" no different then if you just started playing a new game.

If you have gaps, then it could be the other person just isn't being drawn out that well. It's up to you to keep pursuing conversation, but I'm reaching my limits in terms of friends, so if I don't get reciprocation and openness quickly I'll move on."
soc_390759,socialskills,reddit_comment,256,"You have a happy problem, because 3 options open up to you now:

1) It’s a gift of opportunity for a better life

Walking and eating are habitual tasks that most people don’t give a second thought about. A lot of people have flaws in their gaits (how they walk) and how they eat. Some of such flaws develops into health issues later, Eg repetitive stress injuries (RSI) are some of such. Most people zombie through their life, meaninglessly, purposelessly. You don’t have to join the horde. 

So when you bring such automatic functions (walking and eating) to the conscious level, it’s an opportunity to rectify any flaws and improve upon them; for optimal efficiency, better health, effectiveness, poise or grace. 

The Alexander Method, Yoga, Taiji, mindful eating helps you in such. Google for more info. 


2) You’ve just got the red pill

What people take for granted while you have conscious attention of, is like taking the the red pill in the matrix. You may discover the deeper truths in life, and existence. 

Entire philosophies and traditions of wisdoms are based upon this technique of bringing the unconscious to the conscious: Taoism, Yoga, Mindfulness practices and psychology.

Why eat? What is walking made up of?

Lots of books on the subject. Google for  Ajhan Chah’s Books, and the other key words in the paragraph above. 

3) Let go of the inner chatter

Why make it so complicated?
Keep things simple!
When walking, just walk;
When eating, just eat;
Savor the fragrance and enjoy the flavours!"

Asking questions that are related to the topic of conversation is a good way to be involved. It also shows that you're attentively listening to the person. 
Try to be aware of when you start spacing out and kind of bring yourself back to earth then and there. 
You can also steer the conversation to the topic if your choice depending on the people you are with at a given time.

soc_74993,socialskills,reddit_comment,233,"A word on the confidence thing.

It depends on your disposition, but you can overstep it.  I did, and I've seen others do it too.  Everyone knows confidence is a major component of success in anything, so a lot of people focus on that when trying to improve themselves.  That's not a bad thing--I started trying to work on confidence when I wanted to get better with women around the time I turned 20; I had always been too uncertain and awkward around them to get noticed much.  It worked pretty well.  However, there was a dip in my social activity as a result of me getting a little too good at it--I kind of slid from being funny and cocky to being belligerent and edgy.  

There are some other factors that contributed, but still, you can overdo it.  It's hard to imagine for a lot of people who have been pushed around their whole life, like I was, but at some point you might actually get your head above water and still think you're drowning.  My social life improved substantially when I started to relax the alpha-male thing a little bit and learn to goof around a little more.

It depends on your values, your disposition (some people just pull off certain personalities better), and the impression people already have of you, but confidence is NOT the only key.  There are many."
soc_738151,socialskills,reddit_comment,746,"Okay, I’m gonna say right off the bat, you’re in a complicated situation. Any advice I give is advice you will need to implement yourself and learn for yourself, but I do have advice I can give you. I’ve been through numerous of these situations, all different, but slightly similar, so I’m taking aspects from all of them. (Just trying to build my credibility here) Also I’ve spent time learning from outside sources. I’m going to reference a book called “Models, Attracting women though honesty” for part of this, so if you’re looking for more “in-depth” and detailed, general advice, I recommend you buy that book, it’s really thorough.

Okay so you’ve already done step 1 it seems, which is giving yourself a good base. Before you try to attract any woman, make yourself attractive.. to yourself. That’s how you attract the right ones. Make yourself leaner, dress better, and build confidence in your motion. Have good posture, shake hands hard, smile, and dress well (I’m not saying dress in a suit, just don’t wear rags or baggy clothing). But it seems you’ve done this and now because you’ve done this you’ve attracted her attention. But that’s where you’re at: you’ve simply attracted her attention. It’s important to know where you’re at.

Now onto the advice you’re hoping for. In “Models” the author explains 3 mental states of women. Responsive, neutral, and unresponsive. Basically if they are responsive, it means they like you and they are showing it. That’s what you are looking for when you say “she doesn’t respond when I touch her, she’s just neutral”. And as you say, neutral is when they allow it to happen but do nothing. Unresponsive is when they aren’t interested. It seems your girl is in the neutral state and your job is to push her to one of the other states. If you don’t push her into one of the 2 states, she will eventually push herself into Unresponsive. That’s why it’s okay if you fuck up. It’s okay if YOU push her into unresponsive because she was going to go there anyway. You have to be able to let go. I know it’s a hard thing to concede, but do your best.

Anyways, you haven’t fucked up yet, at least not majorly. The other thing (and most important thing) the author talks about in his book is what makes a man attractive Mentally (not referring to anything I mentioned above about appearance). It is about “neediness”. I can tell from your paragraph that you are showing signs of being needy. It’s okay, we all make this mistake with our first love interests. But unless the girl is also needy (which it doesn’t sound like she is) she will not respond to that behaviour. When you say “this was shit because you weren’t there”, you’re investing yourself too much. You sound needy. It’s okay to joke and compliment, but you can’t show her how desperate you are for her attention. You can’t be desperate. This is the most important piece of advice I’ll give you. I’ve made that mistake for 8 years of my life and lost many good women because of it.

Over-complimenting, texting too often, always saying yes, not giving boundaries, letting people change you, and ESPECIALLY, changing yourself for someone else/never sticking up for who you are and what you believe in. All of these things are signs of desperation and they are absolutely unattractive. I’m not saying “be rude”. No. Absolutely do not be rude. But you can still disagree or be upset with her when she says and does things you don’t like. Women respond well to this. If she doesn’t, it’s because she was just toying with you anyway and doesn’t respect you.

Lastly, like I said, waiting too long just makes women bored and moves them from neutral to unresponsive. It’s important to express your interest as early as possible. The earlier the better. How you do it is up to you. Don’t let her get comfortable with you as a friend. How you go about it is up to you, whether it’s with a move, or just asking her directly. Think about how you want to do it, but don’t text. The more confidence you exert into it (looking into her eyes when you say it, etc) makes it all the more powerful.

I leave you with that my friend, best of luck to you and hopefully this helps."
soc_958903,socialskills,reddit_comment,265,"Really, this seems like an issue more suited for therapy than quick internet advice, because abandonment issues can be really hard to face without support (and a nonjudgmental outside perspective can truly help you gain perspective).  However, just in the sense of what you can do to have better boundaries, try to notice when you're tempted to rely on others.  When this happens, instead of opening the app, tell yourself that you will try to handle whatever it is on your own first.  Of course, then follow through and try. 

If you are someone who finds affirmations helpful, then outright tell yourself, ""I am capable of handling this on my own.""  If you find that not helpful, try the version of ""I'll try to deal with this myself for the next little while,"" and set yourself a time.  It doesn't matter if it's days or just a few minutes.  All that matters is that you pick something you can psychologically handle and stick it out.  You can always at the end of that time ask yourself if you can stick out another brief period of time.

You can apply it to the feeling of needing to apologize, too.  ""I will not apologize because that's actually counterproductive right now when I promised my friends space.  I will not do it for the next hour/day/week at least.""

Likewise with seeking confirmations of your decisions.  Tell yourself you will live with the consequences of your decision, and go ahead and make it on your own.  You already know it's unfair to make your friends 'responsible' for you somehow."

Especially when it comes to parents we often see them with a lot of assumed responsibilities over us which is reasonable. But like many people said, they prob didn’t know themselves what to do or saw his behavior as normal. 

Reading his post again I do see that he’s not blaming them he is frustrated that they invalidate his struggle to manage his social anxiety and they aren’t really helpful in helping him build his skills in confidence. They do actually make it worse because it triggers his shame response. 

I do see your point but my post was to challenge him in considering another option. Yes, if his parents had made an effort to help that would make him feel better. But they aren’t equipped for that and he needs to accept that about them and not expect more. Right now if he clings to the “they should have” in the past he will grow resentful of them and himself because we can’t change them or the past"

I know it’s hard to admit embarrassment and being vulnerable when you’re a teenager though. The thing about carrying a conversation is that you’re not the only one talking, in this situation you are two... right? Don’t put so much pressure on yourself. Try not to impress her with how ‘smooth’ or cool you are or whatever. Try to ask about her, if you want to get to know her you must have some things in mind that you want to know? Ask what kind of music she likes, maybe ask her to send you a playlist because you ‘really need some new music’, ask her about her hobbies, then ask about those, ask if she can help you with a problem etc. Don’t make it an interview though, start somewhere and try to spin off of that. When the conversation eventually dries out a little then you can ask something else. Feeling seen, heard or listened to by someone is pretty attractive.

I don’t know if your trauma makes this worse than it is, but it seems the guy goes over some boundaries. But more than that, it doesn’t matter how your friends think this Ted is - it matters how he makes you feel, and they should at least talk to the guy, if they care about you and your friendship.

Did you try talking to other women that you saw are uncomfortable when Ted is around? Maybe if more complain about him, your friends will take some action against the guy.

You could try talking with this guy yourself - but I don’t know how much it helps, once he’s inebriated. Or maybe just make a scene, I don’t know.. maybe it will force your friends to take action. You might not like the actions they take - as they might consider you’re exaggerating- but that’s how life is, not all friendships last forever.

You should take risks in life, but you have to draw the line somewhere. I specialize in worker safety and we evaluate the importance of hazards based on the likelihood and the magnitude of them. While I think the likelihood is small - as there are people close by, most of the time, the magnitude seems to be pretty high. This kind of abuse can do so much harm - and even if nothing happens, being under a stress like this is harmful by itself.

It’s up to you what measures you take, in the end. If it was me in this situation I think I would actually stop visiting. Or at least leave as soon as he shows up. And I would tell my friends why - not necessarily the part about the abuse you already suffered - but the part where he scares you enough to stop visiting them, if he is there."
soc_1086678,socialskills,reddit_comment,281,"From personal experience, I think it's something that takes practice over a long period of time. Kind of like getting your driver's license. Forming a meaningful relationship is a long windy two-way road. If you are speeding down this road without paying attention to your surroundings and being mindful, you are likely to crash. However, if you slow down a bit and try to be mindful of other people and the things around you, then the chance of crashing decreases significantly. There are a few things though that you must be aware of before you even start driving on this road. Firstly, vulnerability, you have to understand that if want to drive you have to allow yourself to be vulnerable to strangers by trusting them. This doesn't mean believe in them completely, but rather just enough so you don't start swerving as soon as you see some one coming down the lane. Sorry for the long metaphor, but it's how I could best describe it. Basically, it'll take you a while, try to let yourself be vulnerable to others, and give it time. If it helps, try to pace your conversation so you aren't talking to them for 2 days straight. Also, own up to what you are doing and try to fix what you're doing wrong. For example, ghosting people you want to be friends with. I know it's much easier than the alternative, but it's also more detrimental to what you are trying to achieve. There is no magic trick or tip to being more social. It's hard work and about developing helpful personality traits.  However this is just my two cents. I hope this helps, and good luck."
soc_236542,socialskills,reddit_comment,167,"I never found people's interests to be that strong of a conversation starter.  Unless you're at a conference or you meet something in the same field, chances are your interests and theirs are pretty dissimilar so I don't like those odds. 

People are people.  We like travel because it broadens the mind. We like pets because we like feeling loved, and to give love.  We hate bad drivers. We like it when the sun's out after a few days of rain. We like to hear when someone gets a new job, graduating, any life altering transitions.  Focus on human insights instead of skin deep topics. 

For example last year I used ""so I'm having my 10 year reunion"" as an icebreaker and it was great. It represented a daunting feeling most people can relate to, an excitement for some.  It's a topic that everybody has an opinion about, but not everybody has an opinion on the new Marvel movie.

First off, yes, you should certainly take it as a good sign he’s coming alone (you should take it as a good sign he’s coming at all!). His mother told you directly what’s happening— there’s no need to doubt it! 

Second, the easiest way to make conversation is to be genuinely interested in his life. Be curious about what he does with his time, what he enjoys, etc. So you can listen and learn (which most people appreciate because they like being heard!), and the questions will come naturally because they’re things you actually want to know. 

Third, hopefully he’ll be doing the same in return for you — taking a genuine interest in your life and listening/hearing what you have to say. Not everyone is good at this, but people appreciate it on both sides of a conversation. 

Fourth, you’re going to do great! In the morning, do something that makes you feel confident (exercise, draw, shower... whatever works for you). Wear something that makes you feel confident and comfortable. 

Fifth, before you’re going to meet him, look in the mirror and give yourself a great big smile for 5+ seconds!! This will lift your spirits and help make you excited and happy going into the conversation — emotions that are likely to hold throughout. Smiling and laughing throughout help to keep both of your spirits up.

Finally, be yourself! You’ve known each other a loooong time and he wouldn’t be showing up if he didn’t like you even a little bit... clearly he likes the you he’s been seeing for 10+ years :) 

You’re going to do great and, worst case, you get a great learning experience and a funny story. Have fun, friend ;)"

I know you said that you don’t want to call her, and I’m sure you don’t want to make yourself vulnerable again, but you also say you aren’t happy about the state of things with her. I think you have to decide for yourself how much effort you can put into this without hurting yourself. That might be zero effort at this point, and that’s totally fair. But if you feel like a call or text saying something like “I’d love it if we talked more” wouldn’t be too much for you, that’s good too.

Easy, every excuse is enough really. Find something you like about other person - go up to him and tell him, or if you have some questions and dude looks like he could know the answer, go ask it. You can even casually bring up that ""oh it seems everyone already knows one another, I haven't met you though, I'm wol_f, nice to meet you."" If someone looks like he\she's bored go up to him and start a convo for any damn reason. Compliment her earrings, comment on lecture you both attended, ask where dude bought his sandwich, anything. Just be casual, relaxed and open, introduce yourself after you exchanged some thoughts. Call them by name a lot and greet when you see them next time. One thing leads to another and after some time you'll get to know everyone. If they don't look busy (staring at the phone doesn't count as busy) any excuse to start a conversation is good enough.

2) If I wasn't in the wrong, is it possible that she perceived it in a way that I could have been?
3) If I wasn't in the wrong and she's being unreasonable anyway, is this really worth arguing over?

Lots of times you will realize you said or did something totally out of line. You'll need to suck it up, apologize, and do better in the future. Explain to her you know you fucked up and that you will try not to do it again. Remember, apologizing for something means nothing if you do it again tomorrow.

If you don't think you were wrong, put yourself in her shoes and see if there's any reasonable way you could be the bad guy from her perspective. Maybe you made a joke at a party and she got upset about it. Yes, that's just your part of your personality and sense of humor. But she saw it as offensive. It's a difference in character, and you will find there are many differences between you as time passes. You may want to apologize and tell her you didn't know she felt that way about whatever topic you joked about. Use it as an opportunity to get to know her better. And again, make sure you don't do it again.

If you make it to number three, you will start to ask yourself serious questions. Can I be with this person? Let's say you told a joke about a totally innocent topic like your favorite flavor of ice cream. Something as innocent as ice cream could never be twisted into a real point of controversy, right? Wrong. There will be times when you know you are right, 100% without a doubt, and she will still be upset. This is the time when you need to decide if it's really a big deal to you. If it's something like the ice cream joke example, you may want to just cut your losses and let it go. Tell her, ""I'm sorry, there's nothing wrong with having vanilla as your favorite flavor. I won't joke about it again."" And drop it. Or you might decide, ""Who the fuck gets upset over ice cream?"" And you will need to kindly tell her that she's being ridiculous, without using words like ""crazy,"" ""insane,"" or ""childish."" Every person has a threshold of bullshit they can put up with, and you will need to know exactly where yours is.

You will face many of these tests and sometimes you will fail. Sometimes she will fail. Sometimes you'll both fail, and you might come to a point where you realize you are just two totally different people that can't be together. These are all okay. Being a mature person in a relationship is difficult. You'll have to apologize for things you don't think you were wrong about, but you'll also need to know when to stand up for yourself. Don't let her walk all over you, but understand that sometimes she will just be right no matter what. The key is to accept that."
soc_1471005,socialskills,reddit_comment,190,"I think it depends on how you feel about it. Some people are fine with it and others aren't into it at all. If the idea is already giving you jitters, sit and think on it and see what your knee jerk response is.  Count down from 5 and on 1, say whether you're really comfortable with it or not, and if it's not a resounding yes, then it's at least ""not at this time"".

I will say that I wish the notion of a first time and virginity just went away.  It doesn't do anyone much service, it's way too much pressure, and it's kind of silly altogether. I think it's mostly a religious and hereditary hold over before people had access to contraceptives and when kids inherited titles and stuff.  Nobody is a duke or earl anymore and needs their kid to marry a virgin, ensure the family line,  yada yada. 


Use protection, be careful, consenting adults and such, and have fun!  Also, don't worry about how it goes.  It's fine, no matter what, we're all just stinky meatbags doing our best, and pretty much everything is normal."
soc_1778011,socialskills,reddit_comment,467,"You attract what you put out. The guys you think are immoral in their methods of getting women, will naturally attract the kind of women who like that style. This is why I don't hold any judgements. If you have a more respectful style, then you will attract women who appreciate that more, but either way you still have to practice your style of ""game"" with women, and people in general otherwise you'll attract low quality people into your life if you don't ever expand yourself as a person.

I'm not saying you're a low quality person, I don't know you, but the kind of girls I personally want, I wouldn't be able to get if I chose to hide away and remain socially stunted and introverted. Even introverted girls generally like guys who are less introverted than themselves, because most people who are shy or socially anxious want to be shown how not to be. They don't want to be stuck with someone who is exactly like them, because they'll never break out of the hermetical life they already have. There are exceptions of course. Maybe introversion is the wrong term, and I mean people who are socially awkward or anxious.

Until you know what you want, you won't be able to get it so I can't help you with that so far. That's entirely up to you to figure out. All I can say is, you already have some form of game and you won't know what that is until you start speaking to women you're interested in, and then if you continue doing that you'll learn to develop it and refine it so that it not only feels natural to you, but also becomes more effective in getting the kind of girls and relationships you want. If you're just waiting for them all to come to you naturally, then you might be waiting a long time regardless of whether you're good looking or not. You have to put yourself out there a little and find out.

And finally, there is nothing immoral about talking to women you're interested in. You have to try and remove that idea from your head. The only thing that could be immoral about it is the approach and how one handles it, but just trying to meet women whether it's for the sake of sex or a relationship, is not immoral. It's natural and everyone is doing it. You'd be surprised how many ""immoral"" women there are out there too - they're not all angels. But you wouldn't know that if you didn't put yourself out there. I like sex, so if I'm not looking for a relationship, I'm looking for sex and so are the many girls I've slept with. I don't judge them, the feeling is mutual."
soc_542544,socialskills,reddit_comment,332,"Aaaahaha yeah, I’m stoned. I write a lot 😂

I think it’s a great idea to take time. Like I said, I’m going through this now, too. But it happened to me more like a month ago, and I was the one to say I didn’t want to talk anymore. Making the decision to stop talking to someone who I appreciated, because I felt mistreated, was really difficult. There’s a lot of pain involved. It feels like I’m choosing between my self-respect and the possibility of connecting with a really wonderful person. It looks like you’re trying to find a way to have both, which I believe is *totally* possible. But that doesn’t mean it’s gotta happen right now. It could be even like three years from now. Why not? There are no rules. Time gives us a lot of perspective and calm. 

I also think taking the time to think about what you deserve is really important. The biggest message I got from your OP is, “I was mistreated and I don’t want that to get swept under the rug.” Big mood. Time in this case means putting yourself first. You can wait until you feel sure of your decision!

A good way to get to the bottom of how you feel would be to consider why you came here for advice. Is there something you wanted someone to confirm for you? If so, you can confirm it for yourself. You can follow your own advice. It’ll either be a lesson or a blessing. What you decide might work out! Or maybe not; you might come to regret your decision—but the feeling will teach you what you want and will ultimately strengthen the connections you form in the future. That itself is worth appreciating! 

Good luck! There are a lot of people who love you and treat you well. You deserve that! I’m basically just telling you what I wish I could tell her hahaha. But anyways, take care of yourself."
soc_235472,socialskills,reddit_comment,182,"As someone who has actually gone to a club on my own, just to try it. Here is what I found:

You make new friends and you actually go talk to those girls/guys you find attactive because you have no friends to sit back and chill with.

No one can tell you're on your own to be honest. You think people notice but I promise you now they dont. My evidence is I met two girls when I went out and they thought I was with some random guys standing behind me. I didnt interact with them once, but just by geographically being near them I was associated. It's a powerful tool both to look good and to divert attention.

I made probably more friends in that night than I ever have otherwise. 

I think it is something to do once every 3+ months. Just as something different. But you need to be very active. If you sit by the bar alone then of course you'll look ridiculous so you have to approach literally everyone you see to make friends and more."

I naturally have an introverted personality, on top of that, all through my teens everyone I knew fed me this bullshit about how having friends/a social life/a relationship isn't worth the trouble and people aren't worth it, most likely because the people telling me that were just having a hard time with someone and were venting or something. Now it's all caught up to me, I'm pretty sure no matter how much you hate people it'll catch up to you eventually. For me the way forward seems to be to figure out some sort of social quota where you force yourself into some social environment every week or month or two weeks, and then don't worry about it until it's time to do it again."

soc_367107,socialskills,reddit_comment,642,"In case you haven’t noticed what’s going on here, everyone is giving you valuable insight into what you can do to fix your problem.

Your replies on this thread alone suggest you are so miserable and conceited from past experiences that you aren’t actually looking for ways to improve yourself, you just want a pat on the back, a cup of tea, and some hot model to walk up to you and tell you that she’s absolutely attracted to your balding head and all your worries can go away.

It doesn’t work like that in the real world man. If you base your level of attractiveness off of what you consider to be your lowest attribute, how the fuck do you think that comes across to the opposite sex? 
No matter how confidently you portray yourself on the outside, you will always give away cues that you are unhappy with yourself and unhappy in life. Now THAT is really unattractive.

Here’s some things to consider, because I really hope you can kill the demons in your head that tell you that you are not worthy of having a beautiful partner. Everyone is deserving of a free, wonderful, envisioned life.

Work on self-confidence.
Rather than berating yourself over your shortcomings, consider what your strong points are. You come across as a talented writer, intelligent, and well focused in regards to social cues and interpreting people so maybe write those down to begin with.
Write down your strong points (I’m serious, write down five strong points about yourself that you like).
Write down your weak points. Now where can you improve?? Be honest, because the truth fucking hurts. You are no longer a boy who avoids the rawness of who you are as a person. Be a man.
Tell yourself what you like about yourself, maybe just one thing every day, to start with. 
Hold your gaze in the mirror with yourself. Make eye contact and remind yourself that you are a living, breathing miracle, the fastest sperm, the strongest man you know, incapable of defeat and somewhere, there’s a hotter Marilyn Monroe who adores everything about you and you aren’t going to quit til she’s yours.

This is called the repetition of success. There’s a science to it. You can’t tell me that successful people can’t be attractive, look at Steve Buscemi for fucks sake. You can be guaranteed he’s fucked a model or two in his time. 

Rather than looking at your physical appearance for the reason why you’re not picking up, ask yourself truthfully - “is your personality truly one worthy of being able to have the girl of your dreams?”
I reckon if you look deep enough, you may find the answer to be no. But you can improve.
And you can keep improving til the point that you realise you probably don’t even feel the urge to hunt for a partner, maybe you’d rather find more of who you are, and the closer you are to your true identity, the closer you are to your true happiness. 
Things become a bit funny when you start delving into your flaws and strengths. 

One last thing to touch on, and I hope you’ve read this because I was in the exact same boat as you until I realised but think about this -

Where you are, right now - do you think the girl of your dreams would be happy spending the rest of her life with where you are, right now, emotionally? If the answer is no, get that shovel, dig into what you need to fix about your life, and I can absolutely guarantee that the balding shape of your head will matter no more in your relationships than raindrops on an ocean.

Inbox me if you’d like to talk, I wish you the best in your endeavour. :)"
soc_1274375,socialskills,reddit_comment,129,"I think you kinda explained it yourself in your post.
You wonder what they want to do, but they approach you, so it's not like they're talking to you without wanting to. Also you've got the perfect opportunity to make some friends right there by reaching out to her via her contact info, which she gave without you asking so thats another positive thing. In terms of what to talk about, maybe say something about the party and ask what she thought of it? I wouldn't start of with the self depricating stuff since it's only gonna keep you where you're at right now. Just go for it and chase a life without regrets!

High school i s a bit tricky when socialising especially because people just stick within their own groups. I can't really just say you gotta do this and you gotta do that cos everyone is different and what works for me might not work for you. But here are a few questions you can answer:
Do you hang out with peers outside of school? 
Do you ever offer to hang out outside of school? As for your acquaintances did you wanna build your relationship with them?
What do YOU think is holding you back from making these friends?

soc_261319,socialskills,reddit_comment,324,"I don't know a lot about clubs because they're not a thing here. But if you're in a club chances are you already have a common interest with these people, right? I know it can feel very intimidating when everybody's already with their own friends / groups and you're by yourself, but maybe you can pick somebody who seems approachable, or a small group, and ask them about it. Have they been in this club for long? What do they know each other from? What are the sort of activities occur in the club? What made them join? Are they in any other club? You're new, no one will think you're weird for starting a conversation with these questions or for wanting to get to know the other members. If that's going okay, feel free to ask non-club related questions and exploring other common interests. 

You might not have an amazing conversation the first time. Maybe you ask two questions and get stuck. But by the next meeting you'll probably feel a bit more comfortable with the people you talked to - they know you, so you can greet each other personally, maybe ask how their day is going, or another club / college related question you might have if you're feeling up to it. If they're on a greater level than you, you can ask for advice on how to deal with X class, etc.

Even if you're having a hard time with that and you don't approach anybody, chances are that you'll eventually end up talking to people anyway. The first times might be a bit awkward / difficult, especially when you're feeling isolated from the rest of the group and wanting to talk to people but not knowing how to do it, but eventually someone will come up to you. Try to look approachable, actively participate in whatever it is that goes on at clubs, be open. It'll get easier, hopefully. "
soc_1478133,socialskills,reddit_comment,181,"I agree she is showing less interest there. But in general I wouldn't 'confront' or 'distance' (unless you want that yourself.) I would just EXPAND your social life and maybe keep her as a more 'occasional' friend. Check in with her once in a while, invite her when you feel like it, but de-emphasize her importance in your life. She isn't treating you like her #1 or #2 bestie, so you should do the same. Move her down your list, but still keep the avenues of communication open. (Again, your choice on that.) I just feel confronting her gives her too much importance/power with respect to what she's earned. It puts her in a position of accepting/rejecting you, and hey, YOU get to make that choice too! If she isn't giving enough respect or friend vibes, then she gets downgraded while you expand into other areas.

I'd be reluctant to cut things off because it's unnecessary and can look (and feel) a little weak, like you're trying to punish the person, when you can just respond with less attention to them."

If you don't think they'd mind, maybe said you had a dream about them, it made you wanna reach out. Or they just came across your mind, ask them how they've been. I'd start broad, judge how to go forward by how receptive their answers are.

The issue boils down to YOU. As harsh as that may sound, it is also liberating to know that you don't rely on any external thing - what if someone else held the key to your happiness, that would really suck. Truth, meaning, happiness and virtue, it is all in you, it is all up to you.

Seems like you're the kind of person who needs time to think about what you're talking about but that doesn't bode well for chit chat or other social interactions. 

My suggestion is just start having conversations with people. Start with some absolutes. ""Mondays amirite?"" ""Yeah, that test was hard"" Then start doing the opposite (when applicable): ""I'm more of a tea drinker myself"" ""Actually I'm not a chocolate person. I like sour candy"".

Insert your likes in dislikes when you can. Hopefully it will make it easier for you to stay true to yourself"
soc_183546,socialskills,reddit_comment,511,"I can only speak for myself but for me my close friends provide companionship, and as you said someone to confide in.  They also provide some things that you may see as more practical if friendship isn't of much value to you in and of itself.  Friends can pick you up from the airport, or give you a place to sleep if you need to get out of your house for a night or two, give you advice when you need it, or loan you their truck when you need to move.  Any number of things, really.


Another thing you'll notice as you get older is that new friends are harder to find.  It was so easy when we were kids.  It seemed like whatever kids lived on your street became your friends almost by default.  It's not that way when you're 20 and I think it will get even more difficult as we turn 30, 40, 50...  Most older people already have close friends and some aren't really looking for a new one, and it can be hard to break into a circle of friends who have known each other for years when you're the new girl.  Abandoning your friends now may be a decision you'll regret later.


You'll really appreciate having friends when something bad happens in your life.  It's easy to sit back and say that you can provide everything you need by yourself but how potentially close are you from losing it all?  How many months could you be jobless?  What would you do if your home burned down or was destroyed in some other natural disaster?  You could rely on the kindness of strangers but I think you'd find it more fulfilling to see that there are people who genuinely care about you and who will go out of their way to help you when you're down.  And maybe it would be nice to have someone remember you after you die?  There will be millions of abandoned Facebook profiles someday as users die off but that doesn't mean anyone remembers those people.  


Maybe you are someone who has no need of friends but considering that you posted this in /r/socialskills you just might be in denial.  Two common ideas I see in subreddits like this and /r/socialanxiety, /r/introvert, and /r/anxiety are 1) I decided that I need meds to function normally, and 2) extroverts and 'normal' people suck and I think I'd be better off just giving in to my anxiety/fear/weakness and isolating myself from them -- who needs them anyway?!  I'm not saying that you fall into that second category but it's something you should consider.  You wouldn't be the first person to decide that it's easier to quit trying.  Also consider that friendship and companionship is a basic human desire and asking why do we really need friends is kind of like asking why do we really need to laugh.  Neither are absolutely necessary to survival but both enhance our lives.


Good luck on your decision, I hope it works out well for you."
soc_245078,socialskills,reddit_comment,155,"Well I think you need to consider what you're really looking for in that person. Most guys I know who are ""friends"" with girls usually end up being the girls emotional tampon instead.

So they just keep sitting around talking to her whenever she needs emotional support until she gets bored of him. Then he just wasted a ton of his time only because there was the off chance she might initiate sexually with him and they could live happily ever after. 


99 times out of 100 the friend route and the partner route quickly diverge, so you need to decide quickly which one you're shooting for. Are you going to be escalating and moving towards sex/a relationship or are you just going to talk and be friends?"
soc_1195019,socialskills,reddit_comment,438,"The older people get they generally become less open to changing their beliefs. Because the world is a pretty harsh place most people settle for certain things that are easy but aren't the best for their growth. When they do this they have to justify their decision to take the easy road and the best way to do this is to form a belief that the hard road is the wrong path to take.

When a young person like yourself comes along, filled with potential and is displaying behaviors like trying out new things or learning and growing this can challenge someone stuck in their ways to question their beliefs. Doing so feels bad for them and everyone reacts differently to this feeling. A common response is to push or challenge the other person as to why they aren't progressing down a path that leads towards their belief system.

An example of this is when older people push younger people to get into certain relationships or work. They believe that their decision to do these things was the right one because if it wasn't then all of the suffering they faced for choosing these paths was unnecessary. In reality all paths lead to suffering and joy, no path is right for everyone and it's up to you to choose.

If you're looking for a good way to react to older people picking on your insecurities there are a bunch of things you can do knowing the information above. In reality you now know that they aren't picking on your insecurities, rather their own. They want to justify their beliefs by trying to get you to follow their same path. Perhaps the best response is to make your own goals, judgements, and form your own values from things that make sense to you and then be headstrong in the decisions you've made. Your decisions don't have to be right and they could still change with time, but the key is you've chosen your path based on information that you believe is most relevant to you, instead of just following a path that someone else has laid out for you. Now when you're picked on you have clear decisive answers.

This behavior from older people, if serious, comes from insecurity. There are plenty of older people still crushing it, living life on their terms, and not settling. Everyone makes their own decisions what path they wish to take, neither is right nor wrong, they are just choices one makes while living.

Also both approaches have their upsides and downsides.

I’ve tried to mimic that and the outcome is usually pretty positive.  I’ve noticed that if I’m not in the right friendly mindset that others won’t be also.  It has definitely been a game changer for sure, a positive attitude and friendly vibe goes a long way.  Have you ever been in an instance where you’ve been having a off day, and someone comes up to you with a friendly smile and instantly your mood is boosted?  This also works the same for when I have bad days, every thing bad happens following because my attitude is negative.  This is just my view on things, I have to remind myself that one bad thing shouldn’t ruin me for the rest of the day.  

The difficult part is me talking to strangers, women especially.  I feel like they usually think I’m trying to hit on them no matter what, even if I’m not(too scared).  I usually only talk to women my age if they happen to come to my work, and I’ll be friendly and help them as much as any other customer.  I want to try to break this spell, especially with women and become more out going and try to talk to more people I don’t know.

soc_18213,socialskills,reddit_comment,749,"Where are you located? Anywhere in the United States, football will be king and baseball is more like a distraction during the summer unless the local team is in the hunt. Basketball, hockey, or even NASCAR is going to be popular depending on region.

There is a lot of talk about fantasy leagues. To me, that is geeking out on sports on a level I'm not interested in.

There are 4 levels of fans. 

First, there are the die-hards. They do nothing but watch ESPN all day. When two die hards start talking to each other at a party their conversation starts to become as socially toxic as two nerds discussing the relative stregnths of Java and Python.

Second there are homers. They grew up watching the sports they watch so they have the rules down. They watch their own city's teams or their particular favorites. They can walk into the last minutes of a game and have a good idea of where the game is at based on the situation.

Third there are pretenders. These are, I got to say, mostly girls, but anyone who is trying to fake interest in sports. They might wear the right jersey on game day, but when it comes down to it, they are chatting with the other pretenders about other topics during the most stressful parts of games. 

Finally there is you. You don't know or don't care about sports.

I can say you should probably watch a few games of whatever sports are popular in your region. You don't necessarily have to watch your local team for this, but you need to watch games cover to cover to understand what you are going to expect. The other suggestion that you play the games on consoles is good too, but as a fan of sports games, even I have my limit with Madden. That game is too hard for its fun payoff. But yeah, NHL 13 is superb. I hear FIFA is great. I can't comment to much on baseball or basketball games.

So, you're watching your game and you're not quite sure what happened. You have internet at your fingertips. Or take a smart bro with you to explain what's going on. 

I can tell you to appreciate football or hockey you're going to need like 20 minutes of coaching throughout the game. To appreciate baseball you're going to need 20 beers. Although baseball is often the cheapest to see live and a trip to the ballpark is a fun summer activity for everyone.

Anyway, not every sport is for everyone and some people like no sports at all. That's okay. But while watching your assignment game, your goal is to *try* to enjoy it. Put whatever preconceived notions you have about that sport or sports in general to the back of your mind. I feel like most people who strongly dislike sports either dislike the wannabe jocks who make them more important than they are or they dislike the fact that the players make so much money playing a game. Put that shit or anything like that to the side.

Turns out, maybe you don't like football because it's too long, but maybe you see something in basketball you never gave yourself a chance to see. Now you have a new hobby. If you live in North Carolina, for instance, you get to pick Duke or UNC or NC State and go out to a sports bar and watch their games.

What I wouldn't do is like learn enough to try to fake your way through a conversation. Develop a genuine interest in whatever you think is interesting.

Sports is a good conversation topic. Like politics, you can argue about strategies and relative merits of teams, but without seriously offending anyone's beliefs. Like the weather, certain games have an impact on the mood of the city you're in and it's better to understand why that is than it is to shake your fist at all of sportsdom. Like fandom, you have an opportunity to have meetups with people who share your interest.

TL;DR. Sports are fun. Try them. Allow yourself to be interested. Don't fake it. Root for the home team. Even if you try sports, and even if you don't care, if you're in a room with fans watching the game, just go ahead and pull for the home team. Don't be that guy  who wants to explain why sports rot your brain at the Super Bowl party."
soc_813073,socialskills,reddit_comment,181,"Remember there are levels of sociability and how you go about it depends on your personality. Some people for example get a thrill out of being in a loud, noisy room full of strangers they don't really know. Adrenaline helps a lot to get over nerves there.

If you want to be serious about being sociable, consider going to places where low-level sociability is quite acceptable whilst being there for another reason. Art galleries, museums, coffee houses, etc. At your capability you need to learn to pick up on social cues more than anything else before you can move on to actually talking about your interests.

You have to remember that these social cues also change from person to person. If their (or your) personality doesn't fit, don't try to make it fit. That's how you end up offending people and being interpreted as an asshat.

I know you just want to pick up a ball and run with it though, so just remember - a genuinely kind word will open more doors than all the wit and cleverness ever will."

Human beings can be jerks and you can deal with them all the same, man or woman. 

Ignore it or change the subject. Sometimes being confrontational might feel nice but in the end it may not solve anything especially if this is strictly a social hour. I like to have a couple back up responses in my pocket when someone makes a comment I don’t want to respond to; one of them is a story about my dog. If you change the subject to something completely unrelated, they will get the point that you’re absolutely uninterested in engaging with what they just said but it’s indirect enough to avoid conflict a lot of the time. 

You can also ask them to repeat what they said. I found that they often double back and try to explain themselves when you ask them to repeat what they just said because they weren’t really expecting to have to say it again. When they’re asked to say it again out loud, they often realize just how nasty they sound and they learn real quick that it’s not cool in the current company. 

You can also ask, “what was your intention with mentioning that to me?” Again it puts them on the spot to explain themselves which often times they can’t offer a good reason and feel confronted. 

You’ve gotten other solid advice in this thread and most is valid; it’s up to you to decide how confrontational you want to be and how much of the current social dynamic you’re willing to disrupt. People like that do need to be called out and not tolerated if our culture is going to ever shift to a more kind one but not everyone is comfortable with conflict. Your call."
soc_1556493,socialskills,reddit_comment,231,"Consider joining a toastmasters international club. Some has dues but others don’t. This will help you with public speaking, learning words, and building confidence. 

Also, it depends on your environment where you approach and are approached by others. If you play chess, join chess clubs where you have common interests and you’re on an equal ground. You know what you’re talking about and maybe you’re at an advantage cause you’re better than the other. Same thing like anime… you have something in common. 

Another thing you can do is simply say hello and ask a very thought provoking question like… what would you rather have, a million dollars in cash, $5k/week for life, or an 800 credit score? You may not care what their answer is, but you’ll get them talking and you just smile nod and act interested. 

Find a question that may give you an insight on how they treat women/others, their outlook on life, or their passions. They will fall for you hard because you seem interested in them and you’re considered a good listener or someone who holds a great conversation. 

This isn’t taught in school, how to have social skills and respect one another and it’s very sad. There are some good books out there and even TikTok has post of how to influence others, powerful speakers and other self-help videos. You’ll do fine. No worries."

Do you think there's enough potential here to forgive him and give the friendship a try?

Similar thing happening to me right now. Friend gave me no time or attention for over a year then all of a sudden is texting me constantly. I was trying to figure it out when I realised that last year she had a group of friends that took up all her time. This year they've all gone their seperate ways so she needs new friends. I guess she thought I'd just be sitting in the background of her life waiting to be her friend. Well she's wrong, I gave up on the friendship a long time ago and I'm certainly not interested now.

If you think you owe it to anyone, be it yourself (because you don't want to be the guy that ghosts people when they mess up) or her ( because you think she deserves to know why she was ghosted, idk), then you should tell her. The fact that you're asking yourself and us the question is probably telling.

soc_1411680,socialskills,reddit_comment,387,"I.m.o., this is a matter of philosophy (what is, how to, and why to trust, why trust matters, the value of integrity and respect) as much as it is about psychology (why do people do what they do).

As you start to take more time in observing people and developing more of an understanding towards them, you’ll realize that most people are very similar.

They’re expectable, predictable, though it may take more time to decipher some. They either want your company, time, money, or connections… soon enough you will connect the dots, notice patterns in how and when they meet you.

Depending on your social status, you will be surrounded by different individuals with different levels of intellect. The higher you are in the social scale, you may be met by those who may be more manipulative, greedy, cunning. 
That is mostly up to you to decide, where you want to place yourself.

My advice is to practice and maintain neutrality. This has helped me.
Learn to harness yourself in different situations. *Don’t be so suspicious of others, and don’t rely on them too much. That’s not a healthy mindset.*

Don’t make yourself too vulnerable, and don’t get too easily intimidated by peer pressure.

Be confident and know that you are in control of what others know about you, and what they can have from you. Do some self reflection and ask yourself why and how people would want to use you (if any). You are the one opening the door for them to enter your life.

Be open to others, courteous, kind, and generous… but don’t expect much from them. Don’t let people take your goodness as weakness. 
Don’t be bitter and reclusive either, have balance in your interactions. Internalize the best and worst case scenarios, and take people for what they are.

Pay attention, be aware, be smart, and you should be fine.
You will soon find the people worthy of your commitment, as almost everyone wants to be trusted too, and their reputation matters to them. They will prove to you their loyalty, or the opposite.


This is how I treat it, but my methods may not work for you. Speak to a professional if you feel the need. Relax and take things slow, especially when it comes to relationships.

I hope this helped."

You should report what is happening to a superior (teacher, principle, parent) and if they don’t help you can definitely sue for them taking your pictures and using them without your consent. If you’re worried about your appearance, maybe try shaving your head and wearing some slightly tighter fitting clothes? I say this because I have a friend who also started losing hair at an early age and he shaves his head and it looks quite cute.

Ultimately, no one else cares about your success and failures, your strengths and weaknesses. Start forming better habits to make yourself what *you* want to be. Figure what bad habits you have (like, worrying about what others think of you), and replace them with good habits.

soc_1175453,socialskills,reddit_comment,177,"when I worked in mgmt I got taught the shit sandwich, and I started applying it in every aspect of my life - and my relationships got better for it.

the concept is: you praise the person, then give them the bad news or criticisms, then you praise them again.

for example: ""thanks so much for dinner, I really appreciate you cooking. but, next time we have that dish, I think we should consider removing the onions, I don't like them as much as I thought I did. the meal was really great though, I can't wait to have it again!""

""thanks so ... cooking"" - praise
""but, next ... I did"" - criticism
""the meal ... again!"" - praise affirmation

also language like ""we"" rather than ""you""/""me"" reads as inclusive and that you want to mediate a situation as a team, rather than as opposites fighting.

anyways that's just my two cents. I always wished I'd learnt about this sooner bc breaking down communication like that means that I fight less with people as a whole."
soc_127522,socialskills,reddit_comment,516,"I've recently ""broken through"" socially during my first month in college and I think i can help with this.

What I've learned is that these conversation starters (e.g. How's your day been? The weather, huh?) are inherently only starters, and it's up to you to create a good conversation after that.

What's a good conversation then? Well, a good conversation at least in my honest opinion is when you exchange discourse that's pleasurable. What makes a conversation pleasurable? Well the parties have to actually be involved and interested.

This is why ""How are you?"" can be either a simple pleasantry/smalltalk, or a fantastic starter depending on how it's contextualized.


1. Hey how are you ?

2. Great, thanks for asking. And you?

 1. I'm alright, thanks.

2...

1...

My problem with the above conversation is that it's impersonal- it's a canned opening with a canned response and neither party are invested into the conversation or are interested in it at all. In essence, I'm trying to say this isn't actually real talking. It's fake. 

Here's what I would try now, with more or less from the same approach.

1. Hey (name)! What's up, how're you doing? (Or how's (relevant life situation to the specific person)) 

*This is essentially asking what's up, but now i'm actually showing interest in the other person and specifying that this is not just another pleasantry*

2. Oh hey Betweentwocities, I'm feeling alright. My girlfriends doing pretty fine too thanks. We just went out yesterday.

1. Cool cool, what'd you guys do?
(let it naturally flow from here)

What if our conversational partner responds neutrally?
1. Hey (name), what's going on?

2. Not much, chilling you know, you?

1. Oh you know, just got off work, boss was on me the whole time today.  that was pretty shitty. Had to work 7 hours too, man, work really does suck sometimes.

*Your partner doesn't invest himself so its up to you to do it to make the conversation flow. Feel free to add whatever detail to this part, just make it interesting and personal*

2. Yea...

1. So hows it like at work for you?

*This is like the re-invite for him to invest. After you showed that you aren't just being nice, he'll probably invest more now. It's also polite to not talk about yourself the whole time, even though most people don't actually seem to mind.*

It's worth noting that most people aren't very good at conversations with people they aren't the best associated with. This causes them to be oftentimes reserved, being taught socially to stay on safe topics (How are you, hows the weather...). Your job is to draw them out.

Also, use your judgement well- Most of the time if your partner seems reserved it's cause they're shy and not used to conversing with people like this normally. However, just be careful that you're not intruding upon a time when they'd rather be alone.

May have made some errors in the above post, but I hope i helped! Going to bed but you can PM if you want."

Sadly not everyone is as honest with their intentions, so you kinda get numb to it and have to be an asshole to brace yourself against the 70% (personal estimation) of other assholes, people who just want to hook up or use you in another way or who make fun of you or come up to you in a group and want to show their friends how alpha they are.

This is all just my opinion

I just finished my first semester at college, and have been thinking about friendships, relationships and socializing a lot lately. Recently, I've made the realization that friendships aren't their own reward. That is to say, having a bunch of friends is really pointless, the value is in what you do with those friends. Humans are social creatures because it helps us survive and overcome obstacles. The best friendships are forged by achieving something together. 

Think of the things you like to do, would it be easier/more fun if you had others who did this with you? If so, then go out and find people who also like to do that thing and invite them to join you. Basically, I stopped looking for ""friends"" and started looking for 
""companions."" I think that sense of friendship comes after that. 

As far as wether your ""broken"" or not: It could just be that you don't do anything that you feel others would help you with. If this is the case, you're probably not challenging yourself enough, or don't think highly enough of other people. 

TL/DR: Friendships take time. Start looking for companions that enjoy the same things as you and that would make those things easier and more fun. "
soc_127669,socialskills,reddit_comment,754,"It's universal. Think about it: when someone speaks, what is it they want? They want to know they're being heard. They want to feel like you're listening. They want to feel like you care. They don't necessarily care if you agree or not and they aren't necessarily trying to convince you that they're right. They just want to be taken seriously. They want to feel as if their thoughts, problems, fears, and ideas matter.

This is why counter-arguments and problem solving are usually the wrong approach. Because unless they're looking to debate you, which I highly doubt, they're not trying to convince you of anything. And you need to realize that, even if you're right, you aren't changing their minds this way. That's not how you convince people. That's not to say that your opinions don't matter, or that facts don't matter, or that you shouldn't speak up when you feel strongly about something, but you should recognize that, if this person is important to you, it's *more* important to show that you support them as a person than show you don't support their ideas.

Besides, here's the two possibilities you're dealing with: either they're completely set in their ways or they aren't. If they're set in their ways, what makes you think they'd ever change their minds based on *anything* you could say? Their position is inherently irrational (from your perspective), which means there's no rational way to convince them to change their position. Better to just focus on what you have in common. On the other hand, if they're flexible, then you still need to realize you catch more flies with honey. By letting them voice their wrong (in your opinion) thoughts, asking them non-judgmental questions, and not shooting them down, you're proving that you're flexible, too. You're willing to listen, you're willing to respect their opinion, and guess what? In time, they might soften to your opinion as well.

So just... don't. Don't do any of that. No arguing over unwinnable points. No fixing things unless people genuinely seek your advice--but even then, treat lightly.

In short: just listen. Get good at listening and the rest will come in time. And the funny thing is, people want to talk to listeners, but they also want to hear what they have to say. Watch someone like Charlie Rose and see what a brilliant listener (and questioner) he is. He'll often weigh in with his own take, but he's a brilliant interviewer and his greatest skill is in the questions he asks and the rapport he builds with his interviewee.

There's actually a method you can follow. It's pretty straight-forward:

Ask a genuine question that's fun to answer (people like talking about themselves, their hobbies, and the things they're passionate about) &gt; listen closely, don't interrupt, and try to avoid annoying stuff like finishing their.... sandwiches &gt; when they've answered, respond by repeating back what they've said--not verbatim, but in a way that shows you were listening, and show genuine curiosity and/or enthusiasm for the subject (if this seems fake to you, ask yourself: if you aren't enthusiastic or curious, why are you talking to them in the first place?) &gt; at this point they're either talking to you about a subject you can relate to or something you know nothing about, if you can relate, do so (""yeah, I love old kung fu flicks as well, my favorite is Enter the Dragon...""), if you can't relate, demonstrate your interest by asking more about it (""the closest thing to a real kung fu movie I've ever seen is *Shanghai Knights*, but I'd love to watch some proper ones, I just don't know where to start""). You just repeat this process of ask &gt; listen &gt; relate &gt; ask over and over again. You'd be surprised how quickly people will open up to you, because most people, even the good talkers, aren't very good listeners, and *everyone* likes a good listener. And don't be afraid of showing your ignorance. People love to help other people. They love to initiate new people to the niche stuff they're into. Whether you've seen a bunch of kung fu movies or not, you're essentially making yourself available to hang out with in the future. You're opening the door to future hangouts/dates/parties/whatevers where you'll watch kung fu movies together, either because you love them too or because you're curious and eager to see more.

Anyway, hope that helps.

**TL;DR:** be curious, learn the listening before you learn the talking."

Maybe your friend was talking subjectively and that *for him* happiness is a connection but it's really highly personal.

These were absolutely terrifying the first time I tried them, but they helped me to realize that it's OK if someone doesn't like me or thinks I'm weird, and that helped me take a lot of pressure off of myself when talking to others. It could be as simple as saying hi/waving to someone you pass on the sidewalk, or starting a conversation with someone while in line at a store.

For me I realized a lot of my social shortcomings and even unhappiness was me being a people pleaser and all my friendships felt so fake in my eyes because I realized I wasn't even being the genuine me. There was a lot of unlearning that went into that and I had to learn to live for myself, and that took time and I wish I could have just snapped my fingers and I wasn't a people pleaser anymore but that's obviously not how it works. You might think it's a paradox of being happy while you are actively trying to change ""negative"" parts about you but what comforted me was I was celebrating small wins all the time and I know I said live in the moment, but I think it's also good to envision where you want to be and just be able to celebrate even the smallest steps you are taking to reach that goal because that's tracking progress. There was some other stuff in my life and I had this stupid quarterlife crisis when I was like 20 or 21, and as a result I really just went all out. I started solo traveling and that continued even today, and in fact I'm writing this post from Colombia where I am trying out being a digital nomad. But back on that quarter life crisis thing, I watched the movie Yes Man and I tried to embody that the best I could where I was saying yes to all invitations from other people and I also started saying yes to myself, meaning I was doing things I thought about doing before but maybe put off because I was too scared or even too lazy. I went skydiving, I took an art class, I signed up for salsa class in college for a semester, I flew a plane. Now I'm not saying you have to do any of those things yourself, my goal was to find new hobbies but overall just experience life. In doing that, not only did I make some memorable experiences but it really gave me so many different perspectives. For one, it taught me how strong I really was in terms of conquering fears. Like taking the salsa class was even braver than me sky diving because I had the worst social anxiety before, especially with girls. Second, through different experiences I realized that the world is so chaotic that people really only pay attention to themselves. This relates to social anxiety because we are our harshest judge of ourselves, the things you might thing are embarassing, are either not embarassing, or even if it is, even if someone acknowledges it, it's out of their mind the next day and you are the only one left thinking and tormenting yourself about it. Lastly, I just learned about experiencing life and not taking everything so seriously. Lifes too short to hold so much worry and stress all the time, I started able to let go and not let things bother me, big or small. 

Well this was long enough and honestly might not even be that helpful because this may have even been an incoherent summary of a part of my life story but let me try to give you some hopeful wisdom. Besides the thinking about root causes thing, the other actionable advice is to stop thinking and just start doing. When I had to think back about my journey over the past 5 years it really does bring a smile to my face about what I've accomplished and how I have changed and you will have a similar moment in your future where you will just be shocked about your own personal growth. Just keep moving forward, as long as you are doing something then you are doing something right. Like I said before it's not always going to be a straight shot up, there's up and downs, but you will come out on top. Everyone's journey is different, so don't go thinking you need to go skydiving tomorrow or something, you will naturally figure out what you need to do to get to where you want to be"
soc_1719669,socialskills,reddit_comment,116,"You could approach, I think that's a personal decision based on how interested you are in that person. 

As far as men not approaching you, I don't think it matters how attractive you are. It's a faux pas for men to approach random women especially in non social situations like a mall. 

Even in social situation like a bar or club I see people react badly when approached randomly - so don't let it get to you if that doesn't happen.

soc_1122963,socialskills,reddit_comment,192,"You’re not supposed to consciously think about these things. Eye contact/what you do with your mouth/facial cues - they’re as automated in a conversation as chewing your food is when you eat. Natural, organic. You can read a lot about a person from their facial expressions, it says a lot about how they feel, and it makes a strong first impression in a face to face conversation. 

If you spoke to someone who showed zero expression, you might gain the impression that they are stoic and composed, on the other hand, you might also sense a lack of emotion. On the flipside, an animated person can come across zany and charismatic, if they don’t come across as twitchy and anxious first.  

What is it that makes you feel you actually need to be doing something with your face in the first place? 

There aren’t really any definitive tips as to what you can/should be doing to get around this unfortunately, because only you know yourself well enough to know what makes you, you. However, that is also the exact reason why this is something that absolutely can get a strong grasp of!"

The truth is that this is pure BS. Your BF may be worried to leave and be full of thoughts in its brain. Pushing him for having sex may let him to fail in getting horny due to the pressure.

I do not know what is your relationship with him, but what i learned is that everyone is different and every rejection has a different reason behind.

soc_672291,socialskills,reddit_comment,565,"we all have this concept driven into our heads since we are young that freedom is all, and when you say that 99% are slaves that means most people, and most people see themselves as such so you insult a large part of their upbringing. 
Let's not forget that part that being a slave is seen as shameful, like being raped, it shouldn't be, the perpetrator of rape should be condemned not the victim and in the slave concept it is just that slaves were treated as lesser cus they were seen that way and so slave=lesser mindset is born, not true but there you have it.

That is what I see for the insult part.

I don't really think so but I can see where you are coming from. i belive you see the thing in this way: you live like you do on favour of those more powerful and so you must be lesser aka slave, but also they can order you around and tell you what to do and you have to cus they hold something essential to you over your head, like the meagre comfort and survival was in the older days, money and comfort is used nowdays.
That may be true to a degree but you can change your life when slaves of old couldn't so I think that using the word slave isn't the best choice, don't ask what is better I have no idea.
Also, like someone above me said, no one is forcing you to stay in the system, or you could just try to change it, peaceful please.
And I have a counter too: in this world there isn't enough resources or time and space for everyone to live out their dreams, unfortunate but true, in an ideal world we would give a larger amount to those that have proven thenselfs, the 1%, to build a future where that is possible to a greater degree and repeat the exercise till we reach a level where everyone could live out their dreams, don't ask how that is a question for a person from the ideal world 100000 years in their future. In our world those more capable or those that have proven themselfs take what they need/want and build their dreams, some help others and some only themself. and so many people remain traped with few ways out and a system that doesn't fully support breakthroughs in status or advancements.
That is what I think, I am only 22 tho and haven't experienced nearly enough to tell you it is like so 100% so take it as what this was, a comment in a sureddit, use it or don't, your choice.
Hope you enjoyed reading that cus it ends here😁😁.

P.S.: Slaves in olden days had a very limited lifestyle dictated by their master, you can form one yourself, granted with some limits but you can, you don't need permission to marry, have kids without fear of them being taken away and sold or to own something or experience something greater than your employer, you can have all that and more and the system protects that in return for your cooperation.

P.P.S: I don't like the system but I can see it's merits and the purpose that it was made for even if it doesn't completely serve that purpose anymore, which is why I don't like it."

I am a Nigerian. I was quite scholastic while in school. I was obsessed with the first class honours at the end of my programme in the university of  which I didn't have eventually. Friends came around. I was quite picky when it comes to hanging around with friends. The friends that are very close to me were in my hostel. Yet, every single moment we fought. Righting our wrongs  is one thing.
I found out that most times I did not learn the art of loving myself first. Although, I didn't have a real social life and wasn't in a serious relationship, I figured out that  everyone I came across usually laugh at my jokes and words. You can start by living every moment of your live in joy, not in grudges, flaws and thinking about people who left you. Go to the grocery store give the attendant a smile. Then, pop! The conversation starts. Don't exert energy on making friends. Make it spontaneous to  socialize with anyone that comes around you. My friends rarely call except one out of them. I don't focus on it. Leave your comfort zone, give yourself a walk down your street. Attend a bootcamp session in any club that interests you. 
Imagine, I am in a distance relationship with a school mate of mine and I am in solitary place from my parent. I do get a hold on my python tutorials and improve on my writing skills. I watch football with some folks I do not even know. We will growl, shout and laugh together.
If you are a believer get yourself a Bible and read. Focus on God's love towards you and that you are not alone. The right company of friends will walk up to you or vice versa . So love yourself first."

I am 25 y.o. now, and still spend a lot of time alone. i guess you have to decide whether you want to be the person that has a lot of friends or not, and decide quickly, because that opportunity to make friends that will stay is passing.

Sharing whatever you think is interesting should also be fine, just check their facial expressions and body language for interest level in the thing you're talking about. People are often willing to take interest in others interests when they show enthusiasm and passion for it, nothing has to be important necessarily, it's just conversation.

So how do you find what you're looking for? It's unlikely that you'll know right away. Establish rapport with girls or friends that seem interested in you and then have an open conversation. Let them know where you're at/what you're comfortable with. These are valid and they matter. 

Know that your own boundaries will be different than others' and that's okay, it doesn't necessarily invalidate either party. You might not have that sense of urgency in common with some people, and you may not be able to generalize why others feel that, but they do and that's valid because it's their personal experience. Keep that in mind if you meet someone you end up not meshing with. Don't shame them and don't accept invalidation.

Give yourself time with people and give yourself the opportunity to find what you're looking for through open communication. If you think you are making an assumption about someone, it would likely be better for both of you if you just asked. If you want to develop experience with someone who is at your own level, that makes sense, don't beat yourself up for it. If you don't want to drink, that's valid. You can have a valid position free of comparison to what others seem to like.

Advocate for yourself compassionately, without invalidating others or comparing your perspectives, try not to take others' preferences personally, and conversations should go smoothly."

Prepare yourself with topics or questions if that’ll make you feel more safe or in control of the situation. And it could be anything, from “hey, speaking of nothing, what’s your fav colour?” to “did you hear about that thing in the news/social media of your choice”. 
Or you could try being completely honest and say that you like hanging out but find it hard to know what to say sometimes. It’s a bit of hit/miss, but most of the time how people respond will show you that they don’t notice or that they feel the same at times.
If you’re heading out to be with friends, prep yourself with some topics or questions that you can note down on your phone, and you’ll have a “back up” if you feel it gets too quiet or dull."
soc_419379,socialskills,reddit_comment,360,"everyone is different, I used to rely on flattering a lot because I like to be flattered but have met many girls who don't respond to it at all. I always tried to compliment something they did, their nails their outfit, their intelligence as opposed to how pretty there are or something generic. 

Some people like the back and forth of friendly teasing, I don't like it but I've found it happens to me sometimes and I used to not really play into it, but if you're respectful and don't cross any boundaries it can make you very endearing and can put you in each other's minds a lot. Do not pick on something they are self conscious about. Here's a super safe example: I went to great lengths to tell a girl that a mutual friend of ours confided in me that she lost her dog and replaced it with another dog while she was on vacation, someones going to say that sounds stupid but it got her laughing and trying to convince me that her dog is the same dog she's always had. 

Here's another one, and I've seen people say it. Force them to talk about themselves. Find out what they are passionate about, dating apps kind of help this because people put up front where they went to school, what they study, where they work. Find out why they chose that degree, that job. People LOVE to talk about themselves. The more they talk about themselves the more stuff you can pick out to relate to them on but don't interrupt, let let speak. Some people have a bad habit of just waiting for people to stop talking so they can talk. Oh, also the more they talk the more comfortable they get, and the more comfortable they get the more comfortable you get.

It can be challenging but I like to believe that its hard for both parties, so just remember that they are probably beating themselves up too and wondering why it comes so naturally to you. Most people judge themselves harder than they judge others.

soc_112677,socialskills,reddit_comment,166,"This. 

I'd like to add for you to be **proactive**. Many people are afraid to start a conversation with someone. Be the one to start it. 
Although it may be scary and you might meet people who don't connect, you'll also find people you do connect with. People you might otherwise never have met. Please keep in mind that if you don't connect with someone, that doesn't say anything about you as a person! Everyone is different and that's okay.

The other side is to **always be kind to someone who brings up the courage to start a conversation with you**. You might know how scary it is, so greet the other person with a smile and enthousiasm (don't overdo it).

Finally, **attend the activities** organised by your club. Ask your new friends to come too, persuade them. If no one wants to come, take all the confidence you got and go alone. Just start talking to someone, there will be other people who come alone!

&gt;Unfortunately tho, I don't have much interest in things ""normal"" people do for fun,

There are plenty of things ""not-so-normal"" people do for fun too that are social and involve leaving the house.

To be clear, I'm not telling you to just not to be a shut-in. But this is your decision tree. If you *genuinely* just want to live a life of being at home all the time, your path to a relationship looks one way - probably largely meeting people virtually, joining some online groups. However, if this is more like an illness, then your best bet is likely working on solving whatever problem keeps you inside. There's lots of options for virtual therapy now you could do for that."
soc_642903,socialskills,reddit_comment,481,"I'm gonna give you an alternative explanation:

&amp;#x200B;

1. You don't remember things that you do not need. Probably you are not invested in those shows, books or movies; no big deal. For classes it's actually the same; every skill or theory that you don't use often (e.g. in your job) will eventually fade. Of course, everyone learns differently; it could be also that you're used a method of learning that doesn't suit you. Try change it up if you wanna explore new results. 
2. Again, this is most likely part of your charcter rather than dumbness. I'm the kind of person that often make some crazy connection between a topic and another, but that *hasn't* to be all people. 
3. You said you **are** curious, so there is really no problem here. You should be curious for your own sake, on the topics you like, not just to ""bring up factoids"" later. If people want factoids, the can go over buzzfeed.  The question part is just about the art of conversation.
4. Again, nothing wrong there. The time is yours, it's up to you how to spend it. More on this later\*
5. It's better to have strong opinions after having learned strong facts on a certain argument. Guess what? Most people have strong opinions first, then try to justify them in any way. If you want to get your opinion on something, just research it. The opinion will form over time. Nevermind not having an opinion now - *being open to change and cultivate your own* could be a good attitude.
6. Again, character. Not everyone is the witty type.

&amp;#x200B;

You totally fit in the social anxiety definition, in my honest, not-a-therapist opinion. The simple fact that you worry about your supposed inability to carry a conversation **will stop you from having a good one.** How can you read a room, enjoy the moment, and come up with interesting topics if your mind is stressing about your insecurity?

&amp;#x200B;

I'll add something more on point 4. It's fine to be content, but I find useful to distinguish between activities:

1. things that I like doing
2. things that I like doing, which are also useful, healthy, and aimed to a target
3. things that I don't like doing, but I must

You'll probably have 1 and 3 regardless of what you do. And again, it's perfectly fine browsing your smartphone while on the couch in your leisure time. But maybe there are also some things you'd like, which will require a little effort, but that can build into something more in time. If you'd like being more knowledgeable, read a book on a topic you'd like. Watch some youtube videos on the matter. Of course, sometimes it's easier to relax, but there are nice things that require effort (and get better the more effort you put in them)."
soc_469459,socialskills,reddit_comment,237,"Good point, women are not a monolith and everyone is different. However, I would not use that as a reason to “shoot your shot” based on the probability that eventually one girl will say yes if you approach her in public or while she’s studying (This concept alone exposes your intentions with me while you’re hitting me up in the library- you don’t really care about me as a person, you see me as a sexy girl you might be able to fuck if you play your cards right. Well get in line cuz random guys often come up to me. Why should I pick random guy you, when another man out there has taken the time to get to know me and shows he loves who I am as a person?). In fact, I would use the idea that not every woman will react the same as a reason to leave folks alone when they look concentrated on a task, and respect their personal space as not everyone is required to be receptive to you. 

If you really think she’s a babe and wanna get to know her, consider the fact that beautiful women exist everywhere and you are likely to meet one in another situation where you’ll be able to properly introduce yourself and without making her uncomfortable, instead of randomly ambushing a focused person and forcing them to make polite small talk with you.

The good thing about a chat with people who have social anxiety is that they are very understanding and non-judgmental because they experience the same thing as you do. I know there a different degrees but it's the same principle. I really think it would be beneficial.

 I'm open to chat too and I promise I won't judge you for not knowing what to say or saying something you think it's dumb. 

Anyway, you can overcome this. I know you've tried before but some things take constant effort, practice, and repetition to change. Some people are very natural at it like an athlete who is gifted with speed or strength. Some of us need to work at it. It's not fair but it is what it is."

If they pause for longer or seem to be looking to me to say something more substantial, then I give a short story that relates to the subject, *making sure to switch the focus back to them right after.*

For example, my neighbor was fired yesterday and felt like it was unfair of her boss to suddenly fire her for not performing adequately when she'd had no prior warnings or discussions about it. So I listened for a while and then shared a 2- or 3-sentence anecdote on how I've been getting very mixed feedback at work this year (like from being put on a performance improvement plan to 2 months later being told how great I'm doing and how they want to promote me, then not even being interviewed for the promotion a couple months after that) and it's frustrating and confusing.

It mostly comes down to attitude.

I mean, I’ve seen some very attractive Indian men and I’ve also seen some unattractive ones, some based on looks and some based on attitude. 

The Blackpill community is extremely toxic and out of touch with the real world. 

At the end of the day, some people will think you’re attractive whether it’s based on race or not, and some will find you not so attractive and that’s okay because we’re all different with different preferences. 

I’d confidently say that I’m attractive but there will always be people out there who will disagree. Again, personal preference and that’s okay too.

soc_324325,socialskills,reddit_comment,484,"Nothing is wrong with you. And I've been feeling very similar for months on and off and it took a trip away from home and everything familiar for me to get some clarity. Hopefully I can pass some on to you more easily.

I suspect that, like me, you are probably overanalyzing the conversations and social situations. Waiting to see something meaningful, or to feel a spark of connection. Asking yourself what the right thing to say or do might be and expending tons of energy in your interactions to try to make them valuable and interesting and...well meaningful. Maybe not, but that's how it was for me.  If that sounds remotely familiar, read on. 

The first epiphany I came to was that the blankness I was struck with when searching for the ""right"" response was caused by the same thing that freezes my creativity when I stare at a blank canvas waiting to think of the perfect design for a painting. The false idea that there IS a right one. 

What I have since learned to follow instead is the most truthful and genuine response i feel to whatever is being said. Basically: be you. I know this is so commonly used nowadays that it's just become background noise but try to hear it for the first time again. It means to let go of that pressure that's causing you to use so much ENERGY on these interactions. Nothing meaningful can happen when you are trying to force it to. Inspiration strikes when you stop looking for it and focus on just being in the moment which, of course, is another overused but deeply truthful slogan.

The other epiphany was that I was spending so much time waiting for meaning and excitement and connection to fall into my lap that I missed the million little pieces that were whizzing by. They don't fall into your lap. You have to find them yourself. I decided that things were good and then they were. It's really that easy sometimes. It can be a slow start but if you keep at it, you begin to feel positive without nearly as much effort. 

Something that was really helpful for me was to list 5 things I was grateful for everyday. Another more specific example is that I started to implement patterns in my own thoughts like looking at something and thinking ""this is beautiful"" and letting myself sit with that for a moment and sure enough thoughts would come along to support that theory.  It's my opinion that everything is good and bad... sort of like a negative space painting (think of it like black and white if you aren't familiar). It's whichever side you DECIDE is in the forefront, that becomes the forefront. It's up to you. 

Thanks for listening, best of luck to you!

soc_38390,socialskills,reddit_comment,157,"As someone who's been dealing with depression, sometimes I'll just feel absolutely shitty and being around anyone is the last thing I want. I don't want to say no and make them feel like I don't like them when it's really nothing personal, but I also don't want to tell them it's because I'm having a depressive episode... so I don't return their texts/phone calls thinking ""I'll get back to them when I'm feeling a little better and make up some excuse or something."" But then sometimes I don't feel any better for a long time, and by the time I feel like communicating with anyone it's been so long that to bring it up just feels so awkward, so I just ignore it or brush it off with a quick apology or something...

That's probably not what your friends do so it's probably not relevant... just my two cents though. Yeah, it's not a good habit."
soc_737015,socialskills,reddit_comment,359,"You have a couple of choices. 

Option 1: You can know that it hurts emotionally but understand that it doesn’t matter logically. You don’t need most people to like you, humans are emotional flawed creatures but it helps when they want to be around you because it makes you feel good, gives you purpose. However you only need a few close friends who enjoy your company to feel satisfied in your life. So I’d seek out those if you want lasting relationships because the people who made you feel awful are just a few meat vehicles that you’ll forget the faces of in ten years.

Option 2: You can find ways to get what you want by acting like someone you’re not. Work harder than others because if you’re better than them at things your social standing will grow.  Smile when you need to smile and do whatever gets you what you want. Avoid things that damage you and embrace that which allows you what you want. And don’t let anyone stop you, don’t let others see you hurt because you don’t give them opening and only take revenge when they slip up and you catch them with damaging things. Because your happiness comes before lashing out.

Option 3: Rely on yourself. There Is joy in a peaceful life without others. If you’re lonely pet dogs. If you think you can attain someone or something go for it but always leave yourself a place to go back to should it go wrong. Because you want a life worth living that cannot be taken away by others.

Option 4: Do any and everything you want to do. Any desires no matter how sick or twisted. Just keep a way to die close. Because when you inevitability slip up you’ll lose everything you had. And at that point escape the awful things you’ve done with death.

Option 5: Do the same thing that brought you to the point that you are at. Do it endlessly until you live a life you didn’t want to. At the end of the day it’s your call, the life that you live is your own."
soc_889866,socialskills,reddit_comment,179,"Well it depends on your perspective. If you're anything like me you would say fuck it and roll with it. But you value that friendship and you want to do the nice person thing, then let them shoot their shot, and if they miss you can shoot yours. Depending on the kind of personality your friend ha,  they could be very offended by that, but if you give it some time and even asked them they probably will go over smoothly.

Either way, if you decide to act on your feelings it probably would cause a little bit of discomfort and possibly resentment between you two depending on how it gets handled. Personally I don't think sitting on your feelings is a very good thing to do and statistically speaking most people fall more in love with someone the more they try and hide their feelings. 

But you take this with a grain of salt because I have never been in a situation so I can't speak from personal experience. Also I'm a guy and your friend's a girl."
soc_1216813,socialskills,reddit_comment,144,"I used to be the same way! I was so concerned with what others thought of me. Then a few years ago, I realized, it doesn’t matter! Who cares what anyone thinks?

In fact, what do I think of THEM? Did THEY talk too much? Were THEY weird? Yeah, a lot of times they are! And that was the problem.

Just enjoying interacting with others is a beautiful thing. Remember, EVERYTHING is optional. Every interpersonal interaction is completely your choice. Don’t like who you’re talking to? Or what they’re saying? Move along! Don’t waste your time worrying! If today turns out to be your final day here on Earth, it will be a shocking revelation to realize that nobody cares about what you said or how you said it. They’ll only remember how they felt when you spoke with them.

soc_269219,socialskills,reddit_comment,690,"Before I get into this, let me tell you up front something I learned: no matter how much you ask for advice, there is no magic button you can press to get over your fears and put an idea into action. You still gotta make the move.

Now, you've a better situation than I had, but I'll still use myself as an example at times. 

The problem here is that in your mind, you want her to be alone, be able to talk to her, and all of this deep stuff way early. You've broken the ice like, a couple times? She probably doesn't even know your last name. Considering you have a way to talk outside school, you need to just say hey and strike up conversation about the day. I do this at my martial arts with people a lot. In fact, it's how I made a friend with a girl (mind you I'm not interested in her anyway but still). But anyway, you need engagement before you can do anything. She needs to subconsciously feel like she can talk to you and that your not some weird guy trying to ask her out or something.

I don't know how things work in the States but I'm kind of like you up here in Canada. I'm rather smart, and while I don't plan on graduating early, I've already taken 4 Grade 12 university prep courses in my Grade 11 year. So this concept of always being with seniors and not so much juniors is something I get. You barely ever see the people in your own grade outside of like lunch and that's it. BUT, that doesn't mean you shouldn't try. Heck I asked a sophomore out by literally going up to her locker and talking to her. Have we ever met before? Nope. But I tried. Didn't get her, but that's okay. &lt;-- and that's another thing. DON'T be afraid of rejection. It's literally the dumbest thing to be afraid of. It's a stepping stone that builds the stairway of confidence.

One thing I can suggest is making *friends* with girls in your grade. If you want to date a girl or take her to prom, how can you do that without having actually connected with a girl before? You can't, really. 

Now be careful who you want to date. She could be a real bitch that just happens to be smart and sexy. There was a girl in my freshman year I REALLY liked. Really attractive, not dumb as a rock. But she's rude and was real pushy towards me. So I backed off. But anyway like i was saying, you need to just get basic conversation going. Get an idea of how she acts, talks, feels about new people talking to her, etc. Gotta pretty much make a friend. On that, you don't have to date her to go to prom. You can be friends you know. And if you plan on graduating early, not really sure dating IS the route to go. But hey I'm just a guy on the internet right?

Anyway, good luck out there, and here's a TLDR:

- Don't fear rejection

- Talk to her outside of school like you know her already. Make conversation. Make a friend. Maybe then you can ask her out for like coffee or something.

- Don't need to date to take her to prom

- The fact you aren't in her classes doesn't mean you are restricted. Just means you have to try harder.


That's it. Like I said at the start, there isn't a button to push that'll make you do anything. I could give you the secret to getting ANY WOMEN EVER but if you didn't put it into action then you wouldn't get any. All up to you now. Just think: they're people too. Imagine a girl came up to you to talk, you'd be thrilled and happy to chat wouldn't you? All body language, tone of voice, and a bunch of other social-skill-type stuff.

soc_1081674,socialskills,reddit_comment,146,"Apologizing doesn’t make you a bad person. But in my opinion, you should only really apologize if you did something wrong. I was in an abusive relationship for years, and after I left and went to therapy, my therapist pointed out that I was constantly saying sorry for every little thing, and when she asked what I was sorry for, I really had no idea. It had been drilled in my head for so long that I was wrong or wasn’t good enough that I felt a need to apologize just for my existence. I know everyone is different and not saying this is the case with you. But maybe try removing that work from your dictionary for a while. Try phrases like, “I sympathize with your situation” or “I’m here for you”. Maybe those two aren’t the best examples, but hope this makes sense! 💕"
soc_233924,socialskills,reddit_comment,502,"I think that's a case of the feedback telling you *some* part of the story but not what actually is going on.

Example 1:

Your choice of words and structure in the first example is both generalizing (""Anytime I see..."" ""usually assume"") and authoritative as hell. You're putting yourself above the article, the author, the user who posted it (since they shared it because they thought it's not garbage) and for most readers you're putting yourself above ""scientists"" even though you meant the interpretation and not the actual science behind it.

The latter is easily fixed (and against what you're trying to communicate so I'd suggest incorporating it) by changing it up into e.g. ""[...]see an article that *claims*[...]"" - you're now clearly attacking the article and the ""it"" in ""it is garbage"" hopefully is harder to misinterpret.

Another approach would be to take the angle that you hate how scientific findings are misinterpreted by media (which leads to you calling the article garbage). Now that I think about it, this is probably my favorite because it's a lot more bulletproof because you're supporting one authority instead of trying to be a different one.

______

Example 2:

(Did you fuck up and meant to say ""Sweden's""? I can't find Switzerland or Swiss when I ctrl+f in that article. Speaks for your conversational partner that you were told you're condescending instead of that btw. =P)

This one is harder in my opinion. You decided to nitpick a specific point and the person in question will think ""BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER POINTS!?!"" - these are the kind of spots where I'd recommend either going all out internet smackdown and mentioning all points I think that are wrong, rolling eyes and not saying anything *or* (if it's for example one major misconception in the article that really grinds my gears) appeasing to people's feelings first. ""While I like most of the article I really feel the need to point out that ..."", ""I didn't have the time to go through everything in detail but I'd like to add that..."", this kind of stuff.

In this case you picked the fact bulldozer on one spot, ignored everything else and take an easy ""victory"" which tends to upset some people.
______

Overall I think Example 2 is one where I'd work on a little in the sense of the above but the first case you might have the wrong friends in that spot *or* you just don't have enough friends that like how you think. Keep in mind that whoever shared it thought it's cool/funny/awesome and you're being the ""buzzkill"" with all your condescending attitude.

From my point of view, bullshit. They shared it, it's up for discussion and you made a strong case for why that crap shouldn't be celebrated. If you don't want to be seen as part of an echo chamber that tells everyone how cool it is they're sharing their thoughts in the first place, this is the way to go."
soc_458688,socialskills,reddit_comment,363,"Hey man, I'm second year Uni. Definitely relating to a lot of what you're putting out. Heres a few thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Texting and Snapchats are worth missing out on. Pretty much everyone I know who is constantly in touch with people over social ends up complaining to me about how fake people are. Snapchat is primarily a game that triggers a dopamine loop in your brain. Don't worry about your phone not blowing up, having silence and space is better.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Since I got out of high school me and my friends just hang out less. It happens to most people. Just find out how your friends enjoy hanging out. I tend to see my friends once or twice a month but they're all in our discord group pretty much every evening. You just gotta meet people where they're at if you want to see them.

&amp;#x200B;

\- If you feel like you're always checking your games and reddit, consider broadening your horizons. If you don't have one, try picking up a hobby that gets you outdoors. A few months ago I got in a rut after this girl dumped me because I felt like my life was going nowhere in a hurry. So I started working out, going to the gym 3 times a week. Trying to go on a hike or just somewhere new in town every few weeks. And I also started shooting pictures on film. If you feel like your life isn't interesting or that you're missing out, it's up to you to make it more interesting. You can't wait for other people to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

I've mainly just learned to become self reliant. I love people and I try to see the best in them but experience has told me that everyone lets you down at some point. The key is to be someone that you love. I stopped loving myself a while ago and I can't remember exactly when. Still working on it every day because once you realize that you're the shit, and you start putting the things you want first nothing else really matters as much. Hope this helps bro, God bless."
soc_1644599,socialskills,reddit_comment,169,"One more thing I want to say is that this really sucks. Both for you and for him. You saw him as a good friend. Someone you didn't have to worry about and he apparently has feelings for you which are not mutual. I was and am in both positions but will never admit to any feelings from my side. I prefer to look for someone else and have a good friend that I can always talk to. Likewise, it sucked to see friends slowly leave because those feelings weren't reciprocated. You already did the right thing by being honest. You said you were both drunk, but give it some more time and see if he comes up to you to talk about it. If he texted you like nothing happened, then he probably wants this to be over quickly, but I'm unsure if that shouldn't be addressed. Maybe he is waiting for a moment again and throughout the time if this is not addressed you will reinterpret stuff."
soc_587379,socialskills,reddit_comment,194,"I realize that without self awareness, a lot of people fail to see and understand that the people they surround themselves with or try to align with - are shit...or...they cant see how their own actions make others uncomfortable and not want to be around them. The question is WHY? Why dont people include you, why dont they invite you? And if you havent asked them outright then it is up to YOU to do the work and figure out what holds you back.


...is there depression?
...is it just social anxiety or is there autism, mental illness, etc?
...what efforts have YOU made to befriend people?


You cannot expect people to be your friend and they dont have to want to be either - it is part of adult life. Adulthood is all about self improvement! Think about a therapist and working with someone who can help you understand what may be blocking you from finding friends. If people are put off by you, and it is a continuous cycle, then you as the nucleus of that cycle, are tasked with learning the WHY and making adjustments to get the friends you want."
soc_1489100,socialskills,reddit_comment,168,"Actually I'm in Europe, and yeah, we already had this surge. The wave is so infectous, that literally almost everybody I know had covid in the last months, even the people who tried to isolate themselfes and avoided public locations as much as they could. So getting covid is almost inevitable for most people anyway. 
The point in isolating yourself in 2020 and 2021 was to ""flatten the curve"" in order to prevent ICUs from collapsing and to avoid covid as long as we could until we have a vaccine.
Now, we have a vaccine, which prevents severe cases for most people and is even helping against long covid. 

It's just my opinion, that restricting your life for months and years to come in order to avoid a virus you will catch probably anyway at some point is not worth it. But of course people can have different opinions, I just wanted to point out that the pandemic situation worldwide is absolutely different then it was in 2020."
soc_1812043,socialskills,reddit_comment,261,"I definitely agree with this, it won't cure it but it will help. I used to have severe social anxiety to the point where I couldn't even call people on the phone and refused to do it. I got a receptionist job where I had to talk to people and call people everyday and now I'm alot more confident and not worried about calling. Everyone grows differently and this might not work for you but I find the only way some of this stuff gets better is by getting out of your comfort zone. If I had've done a job where I didn't have to talk to people I would have still had that bad social anxiety or it possibly could've gotten worse. Social skills are that, skills, they can be practiced and I found seeing what other people said when calling etc and copying that helps to learn it and then doing it reinforces it. It's up to you whether you want to try to work on it or leave it how it is and possibly get worse. If you don't want to possibly try to help it and risk getting worse then get a job you never have to talk to someone but my life is 100X better just by that one job. Doesn't mean you have to go full into receptionist but you can try to find something that has a little bit of human interaction and work your way up and find a job good for you and with people who understand.

soc_1702314,socialskills,reddit_comment,276,"So we can surmise you're not a smoking hottie.

But hang on, you're a redhead? Pretty sure all read heads are hotties. I mean at the very least, the red head fetish should put you on guys' radars.

The sharp jawline shouldn't be an issue either. I'm kinda into that, and my friend is SUPER into that.

I guess it's just a random chance that like some middlish girls can sort of get overlooked. It can also be that you are getting attention, it's just that your female privilege sort of makes most of that like noise to you...

I think what it must be is that you're unconsciously closed off. Right? Like there's a million subtleties in female presentation in 3d real space that we men pick up on unconsciously.

Not everybody can be alpha like me and force himself to do an approach when they see a pretty girl, regardless of her resting bitch face and a complete lack of nonverbal signals.

But yeah, for what it's worth, if I saw a beautiful pale skinned petite red head with a strong jawline and cool blue eyes, I'd walk right up to you and start spitting game.

Post a pic. Let's see if you deserve a marriage proposal.

So I reread your post. And I guess I missed... you say you're ""pretty attractive""? So your theory IS that you're a smoking hottie and all the guys are intimidated, that they all think you're out of their league? I mean maybe... Pretty sure that stops after high school though. College can be a pretty beta place though... How do you do at nightclubs? What about Tinder?"
soc_707352,socialskills,reddit_comment,1032,"Hey my bro! I'll tell you what worked for me in a second (although Im not from the US so cultural differences I can only assume) but first I want to say that your perspective is definitely tainted by depression. The notion that people are looking at you and that it's negative is likely not true unless they are reflecting the vibe you're giving off (people do this, we mirror the social cues others give). My point is that people wont have an issue with you, but depression will tell you they do and then both of your mutual responses to that will facilitate that and boom no social interaction. I'll tell you how I fixed this in a sec. Your friends sounds shit and like they are part of an environment that facilitates depression, ie you are responding to loneliness by jumping into company that only fuels a feeling of social disconnection. Lastly the sport: A competitive league does present some risk, a social league will mitigate this if you can find it. If not why not try a solo sport? Like boxing? If you go to a boxing class no one gives a shit if you can't box, they're 100% worried about their own training, there is no team dynamic and if you do happen to under perform it wont impact anyone and it's up to you to not beat yourself up (which is a great habit to practice to pull out of depression). You will get to meet people slowly, get exercise, and there is no social risk.

Okay what worked for me: okay so I was in a situation like yours I was hugely depressed and my circle sucked ass. I actually got weirdly lucky when I suffered a massive back injury. I could hardly leave the house or look after myself and suddenly the uselessness of my friends showed itself (some of them just disappeared, the closest that some got to visiting me was to come to the bottom of the path to my house and then decide that it was too steep to walk up and gave up). I eventually moved home to help recover and this was the thing that saved me: I changed my environment completely. I assume this isn't possible for you, geographically speaking, but I imagine it is in terms of quality of life. Fuck your current friends. Say you never have weed, don't put in effort you don't see returned if those relationships don't leave you feeling valued. Don't go meet people in alcohol fueled environments (it is a depressant which makes people into idiots), that's an activity for when you feel strong, not for when you feel weak. Okay what worked for me:

1. I faked it. I consciously worked on small positive social cues. I deliberately opened my posture, straightened my spine, I said hi to people and smiled and waved. Yes this was a world of difficult when depressed. But the thing is that it get's easier. It's like lifting weights. Make one small solid effort and perfect your form and you will get the desired result. And then people will mirror you back, you'll make them happy and that will make you feel happy and more confident and it'll snowball and eventually you'll realize that being a ray of fucking sunshine is no effort at all anymore. Practice practice and only do what you can handle doing in any one instance. Eventually people will flock to you.
2. Remind yourself that you are depressed and that you will want to socially withdraw/think people have a negative opinion of you. It is an illusion, remember and remind yourself of that. It is a comforting thought and it's true. Happy people look at other people and think positive thoughts. Haters will hate, but they can't be helped, are few and far between, and only do so because of their own pain, and will instantly forget about you and go onto hating the next thing which could literally be ANYTHING because their problem isn't external
3. After every social interaction ask if it ultimately made you feel uplifted or stressed. If it didn't make you feel any degree of better then it's useless to you and don't feed it. When I got home I made this decision and realized that a lot of my old friendships didn't actually leave me feeling stronger. I didn't feed them (as anxious as it made me) and the result was rapid stress reduction. And then slowly natural selection allowed me to grow friendships that raised me up and improved my life. I still have these friendships today and they still mean a lot, despite my living on the literal other side of the world.
4. Say yes to things and do as much as possible. Hard to do but you'll have more chance of meeting people. Take risks. If you show up to some dumb event and 20sec in decide to leave, great you tried, got some stimulation and had a chance to meet people. My point is try weird shit, even if you're like ""that sounds dumb af and there will be no one my age there"" if you roll the dice you'll have a shot at finding what you want and the secret is that an experience is always a win if you bail when it isn't profiting you. I did this and it led me to slowly meet uplifting weirdos and begin to enjoy and enrich my life. 

Okay so without rambling too much those were pretty much the steps I took. So I met people organically, but I put in a lot of work to create the circumstances in which it was likely to occur. Also I recommend Alan Watts. The dude get's it, and listening to his shit helped me.

All of this takes a lot of time. Don't beat yourself up if it doesn't happen quickly, and every day work on the relationship with you. Be the friend to yourself that you desire for yourself and not only will it uplift you but you'll get a baseline for what you want from actual friends. 

You got this man."

soc_605414,socialskills,reddit_comment,178,"So coming from a guy who couldnt get a gf to save his life to having done okay for himself in the past decade, i'd say if you're gonna take this risk at least be aware if she'd actually be into you.

if a girl's actually really into you and she's likely to say yes, she'll: almost always be the one to text you first, almost always say yes to you asking for a hang out (and if she is busy she'll definitely set aside time for you for an alternative day), and she most of the time really enjoys you speaking your mind.

If a girl sees you as just a friend, typically its the opposite of everything i've listed. Aka: you're chatting her up more than the reverse, you're always asking her to hang out, she enjoys speaking more than listening, and will tell you often about things she'd only tell other girls like a guy she thinks is cute, her period, that she wants to go shopping, etc.

so based off that, make your decision"

These people you describe don't sound toxic so I don't think you need to cut them from your life. They are useful to you so you don't feel lonely. See if you can develop a friendship with one or two of them seeing they're already familiar with you, but beware of sunk cost fallacy - just because you're familiar doesn't guarantee success.

soc_801780,socialskills,reddit_comment,960,"&gt; It’s gotta be my fault, right?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; I had to have done something to deserve this torture; right?

&amp;nbsp;

You're absolutely right. It is all your fault. And that being the case, you're the only person that's able to fix it. Continuing to rely on other people to be that *thing* that brings you out of your suffering and loneliness will prolong and permeate your suffering and loneliness, because each time you try and connect with someone, whether male or female, you never have anything of substance within to offer. You leave your value of worth up to the people that you interact with, and that makes you off putting to be around.

&amp;nbsp;

The people you involve yourself with don't leave you broken, and they don't destroy you. You do those things to yourself. You hold these people to a personal standard and expectation that you hope they'll meet. When those standards and expectations aren't met, you're disappointed, and left feeling worse off, because you didn't get what you wanted in the end. 

&amp;nbsp;

The first thing you've got to do, is decide for yourself that you're unhappy enough with your current circumstances to actually want to change. So long as you prolong this realization, you'll never actually change. You'll have the desire to, you'll wish for better connections and friends, but until you definitively declare that you're at where you're at, and aren't happy with it, you'll only continue to make excuses for yourself for why things are the way they are.

&amp;nbsp;

You'll blame others, you'll blame circumstance, you'll blame the world, you'll blame your God. Anything that leaves you free of the responsibility and honesty that is, **you're responsible for your own life.** That means your friendships, that means your social circles and social skills, that means your personal well being and love of self.

Right off the bat, it's clear to see, from your own admission, that you don't keep up with friends, you aren't too skilled in romantic relationships, and you're unable to keep a majority of the friendships you do form. This fact is further solidified by another statement you make:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; The worst part is that I have no idea how I met these people.

&amp;nbsp;

So not only do the above facts apply to you, but you're so unaware of your own personal expressions towards others, that you don't realize how your behaviors, demeanor, and actions attract the people you end up attracting into your life. You're anti-social, reserved, and closed off. You apparently don't make the effort necessary to maintain strong friendships with people, and as it seems, you aren't even confident enough to pursue romantic relationships you really want, since:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; The only girl I ever dated started talking to me

If you made this post, with some hope of receiving sympathy, I'm sorry, but you're not going to get that from me. Especially since I've been in your shoes, and I came out the other side. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; I’ve come to realize I’m destined to be alone 

&amp;nbsp;

No you didn't. You've come to realize that currently, you are alone, and you don't like it. But because you don't know how to correct it, you're throwing in the towel and assuming it's just meant to be. You're giving up. 

&amp;nbsp;

You suck at making friends, you suck at keeping the ones you have, and you suck and forming romantic relationships without the girl being the first one to speak. But most importantly, you lack any sense of self respect and self worth. 

&amp;nbsp;

That's just where you're at.

&amp;nbsp;

But that doesn't mean it's where you need to stay. Your actions have lead you to this moment, but this moment is just like any other, wherein it can either be a starting point to your development, or an early finish line for the rest of your life. That decision in what this moment is, is entirely up to you. If you choose the ladder, because developing and improving yourself is too hard, and you aren't willing enough to make any meaningful change in your life, then go ahead and down vote this comment, and carry on. 

&amp;nbsp;

If you choose the former however, then accept where you're at right now. Don't fight it, don't argue against it, just accept it. And once you've accepted it, realize that it's okay to then decide to improve from your current condition. 

&amp;nbsp;

You don't know how to talk and connect with people? That's fine, you can learn. You don't know how to maintain friendships once you've formed them? That's fine, you can learn. You don't know how to talk to women and pursue romantic relationships? That's fine, you can learn. Everything you currently struggle with, someone else has struggled with and overcome. All you need to do is look for the solutions to the problems you're suffering from. You'll have to put in the effort and work necessary to overcome each obstacle, but as someone who's done exactly that, I can tell you, it isn't all pain, it isn't all failure. There are just enough joyous and exciting moments that make the pain, failure, and embarrassment all worth it, until eventually, you begin succeeding far more than you fail. 

&amp;nbsp;

Stop being a quitter. You aren't destined for anything other than what you decide you're destined for."

But I don’t get why people think they have to spend money to have a good time.

If you commmunciated that you didn’t have the funds perhaps a park hangout or an at-home small get together could’ve been done instead? 

Also, do you feel you can’t tell your friends you don’t have excess funds at the moment because of judgement or because you simply don’t want to? 

I don’t intend to come across aggressive but this is just my perspective so I thought I’d share. Having been THAT friend that’s constantly canceled on especially last minute I never got why people couldn’t just hangout doing free things. 

Sometimes all people need/want is your presence and interaction. I would never force my friends to spend money but becoming distant without a clear explanation usually creates rifts especially if someone felt like they were opening themself up to you but you’re creating a wall out of sometimes what appears to be pride. But I guess that depends on the progression of the relationship. 

Personally, I think explaining why you do things at times can foster a better outcome for the relationship and it doesn’t necessarily change your boundaries."

It isn't english, its a lazy ass form of speaking, on a goddamn site that literally spells the word for you via suggested point click choices...or after you type two letters. There is no excuse for your kind (a modern idiot) to start your ""culture"" or whatever you think your developing by being a lazy piece of shit.

soc_450483,socialskills,reddit_comment,120,"When I’m in a good mood, feeling energetic, and like someone, it’s usually not much effort to be overtly friendly. Other times I struggle, but I try to give people a heads up when I’m a bit down or tired so they don’t think I’m upset with them. For new people, I do have to try. Being immediately friendly and social doesn’t come naturally to me. For people I don’t care for much, I have to force it, and it can be tiring. For these people, I almost feel like I’m acting, or really over exaggerating my level of friendliness, so that it’s not apparent that I don’t really like them all that much. I hope that makes sense :) "
soc_813952,socialskills,reddit_comment,110,"I've got a feeling that might be more of something you'll have to make yourself get better at. It takes a lot of time to make yourself change in a large way like that, but it's no were near impossible. Try to make yourself think ahead, and go into a conversation with a plan A-Z. If someone is really into a certain conversation, it will go for a long while. If not, then you should have some sort of a back up topic. I'm no expert on these things though, this is just my opinion. I'd suggest doing lots of research on these things to help you out the most."
soc_1414306,socialskills,reddit_comment,151,"Why do you like being alone? Do you feel free being alone? Question yourself often if you want the answer to your woes. Only you know the answers. 

I use to share this thought desperately in need of answers I went to the depths of my soul and determined I had it all wrong. I now feel like the best feelings in life come from the connecting over a shared struggles. Think of this way if you live in isolation your box your limited to logic of one human experience. If you truly connect with 100 people you have 100 different peoples logic to draw from and never feel alone. I don’t think people are as different from each other as they would like you to believe. If you stop buying the sales pitches and see life for what it is you start connecting with ease and your world grows exponentially."
soc_1386703,socialskills,reddit_comment,252,"If you want some honest feedback, you sound kinda judgmental.

""I'd rather discuss any stimulating topic from economics to art to even music and movies, rather than talk about who's dating whom and what abc said about xyz.""

""Also, I can't stand pretentious people ""

You just described yourself, lol.

I don't know you and I'm not going to judge you completely from your post, but the tone feels condescending. You consider yourself some 'non-shallow' person and you think you're surrounded by 'shallow' people; maybe you're just being a bit of a dick and that's why they connect better to each other than to you? When people do bring up who they're dating and who said what, what do you do? Do you scoff; say something dismissive like 'who cares?'; stay silent; leave the conversation? Because any of those can be seen as rude and cold. I'm assuming you're _not_ asking follow up questions, that you're not staying engaged and interested, that you're not giving them their full attention when they're speaking. You're not showing interest in them and the things they care about; why would they show interest back to you?

I think you probably need a bit more self-reflection and you need to think more about how you're making others around you feel. And think about some of those 'shallow' things and why you think they're not important. What's wrong with discussing who is dating who and what xyz said? How are those any less important than music and art?"
soc_409001,socialskills,reddit_comment,299,"So you are parroting. Does it strike you as noteworthy that I already said that? 

Here's the thing about degrees... They are used to make money. Occasionally people learn stuff simply to know it, and apply it to their lives. You know, without needing to make money off it. Perhaps I am one of those people. Perhaps I have watched hundreds of hours of medical lectures, participated in hundreds of hours of classes, experienced decades of interactions with others. Up to you to decide. If I had a PHD beside my name, and said the exact same things I am saying now, would you then take what I say seriously? Cognitive dissonance is a hell of a thing.

Where did I get that from... List every symptom of every ""condition"". Find ONE person on the planet who does not exhibit these symptoms.

Your statistics are highly suspect. You know, since you don't have a phd and didn't do the research. Fun huh?

You fail to understand that ""normal"" doesn't exist. Who defines normal? Freud? Jung? Go ask a cannibal in Papua New Guinea what he thinks of your ideas of normal. Heck, ask an Italian, or a Russian.

Who sets the baseline of your behavior that you judge yourself against? What made you believe you had mental issues? Did you self diagnose? Do you even know who and what you are?

EDIT: Keep in mind that I do not blame you for your view. I've made the same mistake of simply regurgitating facts and figures that have been presented to me as ""truth"". You need to broaden your understanding of biology, sociology, history, psychology, philosophy, etc to really understand it. You'll be disgusted with yourself when you get it, and just remember that I was there, too. Bon Fortuna."

soc_1243402,socialskills,reddit_comment,203,"“Past hurts inform your present experience “. 
You have a couple challenges going on here. You basically don’t trust yourself. You’ve picked this up somewhere in your past (parents, influencers, etc) that you don’t make good decisions or that the decisions you made embarrassed you on some level. Realize this is only a conversation you’re having with yourself. Anyone can overcome a conversation. 
First, grapple with the fact that their is nothing wrong with you and what you currently believe is a story someone else gave you. As we start to rewrite the constant conversation we have with ourselves about not being good enough, this will loosen the grip of seeking outside validation. This takes time. It took time for you to learn the negative self talk, it will take time and practice to learn a different conversation. 
Secondly, trust the decisions you make and leave it at that. Like all humans, we make mistakes and bad decisions. It happens to everyone. As you grow in experience, age and wisdom, your decision making process will become better for desired outcomes. However, you just need to start doing it. The false fear you’re feeling currently, will stop you from ever stepping through the door."
soc_548902,socialskills,reddit_comment,262,"I (f, 19) am experiencing basically the same thing!!! I don’t have much advice seeing as I haven’t figured my own situation out yet, but I just wanted to let you know you aren’t alone! If there’s one thing I can say, it’s to stay true to who you are. As cheesy and cliché as it is, I think people can spot people not being genuine pretty quickly. We are our own worst critics, and just because you can’t see something in yourself right now, doesn’t mean other people won’t. Personally, I’ve been  living by the mantra “fake it till you make it” and trying to be confident, and eventually I think it’ll just become second nature. I wish you all the best, and I have my fingers crossed for the both of us lol

P.s. there seems to be some really good advice in here! If there’s one last thing I could add, it’s to figure out what you want and not settle for less. And I think this can apply to a lot of aspects to life, but in this scenario, I think it’s helpful to figure out what you want in a significant other and wait until you get what you deserve. I’ve been asked out maybe twice, but I knew the guys and I knew that they weren’t going to work out. Don’t. Settle. There is someone out there who will make a great partner in life and in love, and I personally would rather holdout for that than date someone just to date. Just my two cents!"
soc_530717,socialskills,reddit_comment,122,I totally disagree and wonder if maybe the last paragraph is just an easy way out. Like a cop out .. And honestly I understand. But it's truth that you are very very important made of the same stuff as the rest of the universe. That's right As The Rest Of the universe. You are a natural phenomenon that occurs just 1 time. For ever. And you think your no one? You are important. But originally what I said was intended to help people decide to change and give hope. It did help some or many people idk 900+. BUT MAKING YOUR DAY OR LIFE THAT IS TRUE. it's up to you. Thanks for the comment have a great day my friend. 
soc_1550019,socialskills,reddit_comment,140,"Chemistry is real and important to relationships. Social media is public. I honestly see no problem with this other than you fighting with your nerves. I recommend telling her when you ask her out. Something like, “I know this might sound weird but i found your social media profiles before we started talking because I really like you and wanted to know if we would have chemistry. I really enjoy your company and if you think it’s worth a shot, I would love to take you out on a date some time.”

Idk exactly what your conversations were like so you might have to talk through some awkward details. My gf (soon to be fiancé) said she stalked me online for years while I was still with my ex. I found it more flattering than creepy but everyone is different."
soc_117015,socialskills,reddit_comment,111,"This may sound odd but it really isn't up to you to see why anyone would want to date you.  You aren't the person you're looking to date you are yourself and you have certain needs/wants in a partner.  Those needs and wants are most emphatically not going to look like you because different people serve different functions in a relationship if you both have the same traits you will be fighting to perform the same functions.  So when you compare yourself to the list you're looking for you will look like crap 100% of the time.  

Another bad analogy:  You're a bolt and you keep comparing yourself to a nut."
soc_1348175,socialskills,reddit_comment,143,"Why does your problem sound exactly like the plot of a cheesy Romcom anime with an accomplished hot girl running after an average male protagonist for the viewers to self-insert to? Jk jk, that came off way too rude.

That aside, I think she’s clearly into you, or at least she wants to get to know you more, and since you yourself said that you have good looks, this convinces me even more. I think you should just erase the whole “social gap” shtick from your head and just focus on developing a nice friendship with her at first. Then move on from there. Just treat her nicely and show her that you are worth spending time with. Convey your interest in her as well. Make sure she knows that you’re interested in her. Or not, it’s up to you. Good luck dude."
soc_320865,socialskills,reddit_comment,234,"I wouldn't go with complimenting her appearance/general clothing. The reason is, it can be threatening. 

Know that many girls are on the defense a lot of the time. For every nice guy that tries to talk to us, 5 weirdo guys creep on us. And a compliment on clothing or appearance in general can cause an uneasy feeling for some of us.

A good example of this: imagine a big burly man coming up to you in public, tells you how much he likes your shirt, then proceeds to flirt with and attempt to start a  conversation with you. Can you see how you may feel a bit uneasy about this? Maybe this man has anger issues, maybe he doesn't like to take no for an answer, you have no idea, and most importantly: he's much bigger/stronger than you are.

So....I would try and strike up a conversation about an actual subject, even in relation to clothes, like for instance if she's wearing an overwatch t shirt, you could ask her what her main is. If you're at the mall, ask for directions to a store or the nearest auntie Ann's pretzel booth. If you're in a class together at school, make a joke about the teacher/subject.

There's a lot you could do.... and complimenting appearance may work for some girls, but just know you may be missing out on quite a few, too."
soc_1581534,socialskills,reddit_comment,109,"I'm not trying to imply she's flirty.  She's social in the gym (as am I) and it's my friend who purposely flirts with her.   I know this because he tells me.   I can't tell you what she's thinking when he does, but they appear to have a friendly rapport.

I was literally walking plates back to a rack when she did her drive by ""Hi _____.""   I would have absolutely loved it if she chatted me up - especially since I took the initiative last week.

Maybe I'm asking too much and reading too deeply into things.  I tend to do that.  I'm a very harsh critic of myself."
soc_658636,socialskills,reddit_comment,257,"Well it depends on the person.

Recently I had a classmate that always was picking on me, but like lowkey. She would ask me something she knew was gonna hurt me, like about my appearance, or she will start talking about how much better was his work compared to someone else's, or mine, and she did that with other people too.

""Oh you look so skinny!"" Said to a girl (She didnt say skinny but I dont know how to say It in english, she basically used a really mean word to describe his complexion).

Eventually what I ended up doing was, as easy as she said stuff about other people (I think she thought wasnt saying anything wrong...) I just called her out every time.

When she said something mean i just replied back! ""Wow you are really mean"", ""i dont really want to talk about this so leave me please"", ""if you are going to ask me stupid questions you can stop"" ""really? You said that?""

And i would do it as naturally as she said all that mean stuff (trying not to make myself look rude obv) so most of the time she stopped saying stupid things, maybe because she then realized that she was being shitty, or that I wasnt gonna fell for her shit, but it kinda worked because then she changed into a defensive stance ""No im not being mean im just saying she is so skinny!"" And then the tone of the conversation will shift into a less toxic one"
soc_1489648,socialskills,reddit_comment,401,"Your story is so familiar. I had a close friend whose mental health took a dive in her 30’s. My friend eventually went through a psychotic break. Every time I called her she was bawling and I couldn’t ever get her out of that head space. Jelous of my friends and life and yea, snide comments. Even tho my life as a single mom was no party. Her life was a mess, mostly consequences of extreme behavior. At one point, during her break, she threatened my son and that was the final straw. I was convinced it was drugs, looked just like meth psychosis and her family organized an intervention and asked me to join. Instead, I went up before hand and told her what was coming. She insisted she wasn’t on drugs and I told her she had to prove it by drug testing right now. We went to the hospital and…it was not drugs. They locked her up for 6m. She finally got out but was not on the right medication. She was in therapy but that really did nothing. We stayed in touch but were distant which was ok for me because she was really fucked up on the meds they had her on and it was hard hearing her crying uncontrollably. 

Do not ghost your friend but it is ok to create some distance. I know everyone is different but my friend ended up taking her life leaving two beautiful children behind. Her family didn’t even tell me because they blamed me I guess, she was so isolated by her own behavior, I was her only friend and barely that at that point. And they didn’t tell me. I thought it was weird not to hear from her but being her friend was hard so I didn’t reach out. I do know she is out of pain tho. She was in so much. 

Bottom line is she needs you whether it’s a mutual friendship or not. And I know it’s draining, I get it. But I miss her so bad now and do accept some blame for not being there for her better. Although our last conversation I invited her to live on a farm with me and my bf. Thought maybe Mother Earth could bring her some balance. 

Life is hard, relationships are hard. I would encourage boundaries but not a full exit from her life."

Then I got to ""The past is dust. The future is dust. You can't change either."" And I just thought ""That's crap, you absolutely affect your future."" And started to doubt your point here, but then you said it. ""You have no reason to fear either, because they don't exist.""

They don't exist. I think about the past so much, I analyze everything, I think ""Oh, no I shouldn't have said that, or done that, I led that guy on, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to."" But the past doesn't exist. It did, it happened, it's gone. In the present, you can simply speak your mind, and that might make the future, but you don't know what it is. You can't predict anything. You can't make it anything. You can do whatever you think is best, and have hope, but your hopes mean nothing to the future. All you can do is speak your mind, do what you want, and enjoy it.

soc_172293,socialskills,reddit_comment,194,"Here's my advice. Just state facts man. Chick made fun of you? All you say is ""Hey, I didn't like that."" That's if they ask. You literally don't have to explain shit to anyone about why you block someone. Not even the blocked person. Much less, they're best friend. I say fuck'em man. High school is not bullshit. It's the humans you're encountering. Keep pushing through man, meet new people in school, even other schools. I know circles of friends exist but maybe thinking of them as a circle of friends keeps you from making any new ones.

Just my two cents. One last thing, I consider myself very sensitive. I'm not saying I'm less sensitive, but I'm extremely calculated in determining my emotions, people's behavior, reactions to obvious bait (getting made fun of/trolled). Some people follow social norm, some people can't because it literally feels like I'm wasting half of my life going through hoops (norms).

TL, DR: Bro, fuck that bitch. If I were you I'd show up to the drum line and bust out a sick beat, finishing with the standard dropping of the sticks cause damn was that beat hot. "
soc_1364984,socialskills,reddit_comment,139,"Whether their intentions were malicious or not, this person sounds a little unstable. The age difference is a big red flag, as well as the inconsistent communication. 

You seem to have a long history of communication but never meet in person.

It might be best for you to disengage them. I can't say what's best for you, but I don't imagine this person being a reliable partner. 

If you decide to end contact it would be decent to explain to them that you are looking for something more simple and grounded in face to face communication.

If you want to keep in contact with them, maybe insist on involving someone you trust like a parent or close friend or sibling who can also get to know this person on your behalf and offer their security and judgement as well."
soc_1136322,socialskills,reddit_comment,219,"Definitely possible haha. What do you mean you're uninteresting in when you talk? Do you mean your tone or just the information?

If you want some tips, I used to never really know what to talk about and something that really helps is asking them questions on what they're talking about. People love to talk about themselves. Not too many questions cause then it might start getting weird but like an example would be like:

""Hey I took my dog out for a walk today.""
""Oh cool, what kind of dog and what's their name?""
""Oh his name is Spot, he's a lab and we went to the park by the river""
""You mean (insert park name here)? I used to go there all the time as a kid.""

In this example, the conversation is incredibly bland but the basic gist of it is alternate asking questions and offering information about yourself as well. Establishing a surface relationship can help people warm up to you. 

Also being a good conversationalist takes a lotttt of practice and you're right about high school peers being cruel. That's definitely a time where people develop ""holier than thou"" complexes but trust me it fades in college (those people still exist but in way smaller numbers). Might just be an age group thing too."
soc_548854,socialskills,reddit_comment,144,"Maybe you and your family could agree on a nonverbal signal they can use when you are being too loud, for example, moving their hand in a “lowering” motion to represent lowering your voice, or the ASL sign for “quieter” or something, whatever works for you all. That way, they can prompt you to quiet down while also not interrupting you. Even if they think your loud voice is disruptive or rude, interrupting you to lecture you is rude and hurtful to you. I work with preschoolers, who obviously don’t always have self awareness of their voice level yet. When they are speaking too loudly, I just put my finger to my lips, and they know to lower their voice a bit. I am sure to continue listening to them to reinforce to them that I want to hear what they have to say."

Also to give more context, don't burn bridges because that just causes more trouble then its worth. Just hang with them less and start meeting new people in the meantime. Eventually you won't hang with your old friends at all if you want to because you will be surrounded by better friends who you would rather hang out with.

It can be to do better in school/workplace, working out consistently, finding a new style, or really anything that you believe is self-improvement.

For me personally, by achieving these goals I have learned to be less dependent on others for validation or happiness. My confidence has grown and I am happier than I was before.

soc_104138,socialskills,reddit_comment,458,"You want to start off on something that you both can agree on.

Even if they love the class they'll most likely agree with your sentiment and say something along the lines of ""Yeah, college was hard and I enjoyed the challenge but I'm glad I'm finally moving onto the real world.""

Then you'd want to talk about the common fears about going out to the real world. This makes you more like them and someone who is down to earth. Be careful not to sound too pessimistic. The goal is to have them open up to you about *their* fears.

From this gradually lead the conversation to something like

""So what are your plans now? Are you moving to somewhere else? Any fjn activities that you're planning for the last summer as a kid?""

They'll lrobably tell you something general and broad because they don't want to share too many details that doesn't concern you yet. This is when you can lead into about celebrating graduation. This is the hardest part because, depending on who you are and what you're capable of in terms of 'good times', several options can be formulated.

1. You are able to throw a nice party that is sure to be enjoyable? Invite them. Tell them there will be free drinks, awesome food and music and blah blah. This usually works if you already have a decent social status.
2. If they share what they are doing, just nonchalantly ask them if you can show up to the event. Make up a nice excuse on why you'd rather hang out with them than the... alternatives (wink wink).

3. If none of you are attending events just straight up tell them that they are very decent people and would love to hang out some time. Obviously this won't work very well if you don't follow up. If you want to use this option you should at least have three compliments for each person of the group. Then approach just one person at first to build a first impression. Tell that one person, not creepily, that he always admired their group of friends for (insert well thought out compliments here).

depending on your social status and looks there will be many ways to pave this road. Best shot at this is to either building a friendship with one of them and getting pulled in, or pull something (joke that could make the entire class laugh, a funny stunt, show of intelligence... it really depends on who they are as well. You don't to be all brainy when trying to appeal to a group of bros) that'll make your presence a novelty or comfort.

Good luck."

3. Don't take it so seriously. It feels like the world is ending because it's a problem you don't think you can solve. But trust me, that's just your perception, the reality is nowhere near as bad as you think.
4. Don't be afraid to get hurt. I struggle with this too, I suspect everyone does. But without the risk of rejection or whatever, it's impossible to form a real connection.

&amp;#x200B;

As for strategies to meet people, that's up to you. For example. if you like music, go to shows. It depends on you and what you choose to do.

&amp;#x200B;

There's millions of ladies out there, wondering if it's too late or if they're too ugly to find people, just like you. Loneliness isn't unique. It's a part of life. Good luck, brother."
soc_976644,socialskills,reddit_comment,187,"I disagree, if you're just going to post in meme subreddits and places where people get reactions and spazz out then sure delete this.  


However if you use it for good, use it to learn programming or how to draw, maybe how to play guitar or get tips on fitness regimes then it's great.  


Facebook/Instagram you generally know the people and you're comparing your life to theirs.  


On Reddit you're not comparing your life to anyone else's as everyone is anonymous and you probably won't see them make a comment or post again as there's so many people on here.  


Basically use Reddit smartly, not for dumb shit and you'll find it can actually improve your life and mental health, not make it worse.  


Personally every few months I go through a cleanse of subs I follow and remove lots that just add nothing for me. Reddit helped me get in shape with a good workout plan and action for diet, it's helping me learn guitar and helped me get a understanding of coding in python.  


It's up to you how you want to use the tool."
soc_1614862,socialskills,reddit_comment,149,"I recommend taking group workout or group dance classes before school starts. Those really broke me out of my shell. I go to all women studios so everyone is super chatty and openly supportive.

The dance/acrobatic classes reeeeaalllly broke me out of my shell. They would make us perform in front of the entire class. I was so shy, but I eventually learned self love and to not take everything so seriously so it helped a lot.

I’m an introvert and quarantine made me forget how to interact with humans haha. The thing about group workout or group dance classes is that you’ll at least be exposed to social interactions. Whether or not you choose to participate is up to you, but at least you’ll be exposed to a classroom size amount of people before school starts. Think of it as a “warm up” for when school actually starts."
soc_871685,socialskills,reddit_comment,170,"Well I personally can't even imagine myself ever being in this situation, but I feel like I have some helpful advice.

I don't think there's any need to feel guilty; you're only one person and it just so happens that a lot of people want to hang out with you - of course you can't possibly be in several places at once. All you can really do is schedule your time with each group, and let the groups take care of themselves; if they start getting salty it can be either a sign that they're too clingy, or they really like you and want more of you. Then it's up to you to decide who gets prioritised - and if they're all of equal priority, then that's fair enough.

It's down to you at the end of the day. You get to decide who stays and who goes; you're under absolutely no obligation to please everyone. It's important to remember yourself in this and make sure you don't get overwhelmed."
soc_15458,socialskills,reddit_comment,296,"Is this entirely necessary? What do you hope to gain? Really attractive people, and women in particular, have usually heard they're attractive so many times in their lives that it kind of loses meaning. It doesn't become a compliment anymore, it just becomes another person who's dwelling on their looks. So I'd encourage you to think long and hard about what the actual benefit of telling her she's beautiful is. Do you want to ""score points"" with her? If she's as attractive as you say she is, you'd probably be better off focusing on something you like about her than she can actually control. If you want to express interest to her, ask her out instead.

I understand why you want to tell her that; those of us who aren't from the world of the super-beautiful would really like someone to tell us that, and when you're that attracted to someone, it can be hard to get it off your mind. But I've heard from a number of people who are considered attractive that it's not something they want to hear all that badly. Some people will find it super sweet, some people will be kind of put off by you telling them that. It's why I encourage you to think about what you want to tell her, and whether it's worth putting yourself out there for the sake of basically telling her you like her genetics. If I were you, I'd just tell her that you really like her, tell her what you actually like about her (you can make emphatic statements about her beauty if you want, but remember, someone could look like her and still be a total bitch, so it's not saying much), and ask her out. That's just my opinion, though."
soc_8527,socialskills,reddit_comment,206,"I agree with a lot of your points. At the last wedding I attended, I set myself a goal that I would introduce myself to 10 new people. Chances were I'd never see them again so it'd at least be a good practice on introductions. Halfway through my goal I lost count (thanks beer!) so I started over. By the end of the night I was having a great time talking to people I normally wouldn't approach.

The other point I agree with is introducing yourself to new people in the group. Try to be the first to say hi to newcomers to your club. They'll be anxious to be accepted and will look to you in following meetings. 

You can't wait to be brought into an existing circle just by showing up and hoping they'll open up to you. You need to take action, give them a reason to want you around beyond sharing an interest. Who are the leaders in this club? Can you identify the decision makers and influential forces? Get them to be your friend and the rest of the social circle will come around. Find a way to get them to hangout individually with you and get to know you better. "
soc_1062716,socialskills,reddit_comment,626,"Okay, I'm going to use my friend as a example one more time, now analising this other girl's life. She is very sociable, as soon as she started in our school she made a lot of friends and started hanging out with them, but she had a lot of ""quirky"" (hate that word but cant think of anything else) interests, and problems at home that I guess her friends would find weird for her to talk about, so she would go to my fried and unload all on her

That, intentionally or not, led to my friend be over involved in her life and emotionally invested on her problems to a point where her problems became my friend's problems and she was always feeling guilty if she wasn't there for this girl

 I remember my friend telling me that she didn't know what to do because she was getting tired of trying to build a friendship with this girl because she was always talking about herself and not interested on her at all (for you to have a idea, my friend came out and only told her about two days later because all she could talk about was how exited she was about the new Harry Styles album) and I told her straight up, she isnt your friend, she is walking all over you and she is never there for you when YOU have a problem, she just needs somebody to validate her

And all of a sudden, my friend was trying to convince me that she looooved to hear her talk about her interests, it's not THAT boring, she is just going trough a lot of stuff right now, all she needed was a friend and she didn't really mind all the emotional baggage this girl was dumping on her cause they were very close friends, she always went to my friend when se had a problem

Anyway, my point is maybe it was true, and this girl and your friend are completaly unawere of what they are doing, but their unability to care or listen to others IS a problem. And when they find somebody like you, that is willing to put your feelings and needs aside on the friendship and basically care for them they will take advantage of that warmth, wether they realise it or not, and the fact that you are probably the only person in his life that allows him to do that will make him go to you with their baggage and problems and use you as their psychologist, basically

I think that is soooo wrong in so many levels, they have this mindset where you are pretty much a secondary carachter and It's basically like saying ""I can't really handle this, take some of the worry and dedicate some of your mental health to building me up and improving me"" and that is not okay at all if it's all your friendship is build on. Friedships are not suppost to be your personal coatching services, appearing when you need them, helping you and building you up then going back to their house sit arount waiting for your call. 

You have needs and problems as well, and you also have moments where you are not well enough to handle any other than your own, and as rude as it seems to verbalize it to people abusing your listening skills they are the ones disregarding you by oversharing and ignoring you. If you can't tell them, ""sorry, I'm just not in the mood to talk about this or that"" or ""can we not change the subject? I really need your take on this for a second"" when they overshare I don't think they want a friend, just a ear really."

If you are just interested in being friends regardless of your sexuality and his sexuality, I don’t see why you can’t hangout if he is willing. It’s not like my male friends with GFs never hangout with guys for guys night to have a drink, get dinner, go to a movie, play sports, etc. Just ask him and see what happens.

soc_1725483,socialskills,reddit_comment,221,"Guys perspective:
The guy is likely scared, but does not want to give up.  The simple questions and answers are likely because he's scare, rather or not he will admit it.  The reason for the fear varies, but he may not want to inadvertently cross a line.  

Think about this, how many post, stories, complaints do you hear about guy only thinking about sex, or going overboard, or just not respecting women.

Now compare that to the number like this complaining about guy being too mellow, or being boring, or not seeming interesting.  There are more of the latter then people realize, but still pales to the number of the former.

Men are given conflicting information just as much as women, just as much as women, just in different categories.  Everyone interprets it differently.  

My advice is that if you really want to know, ask open ended questions.  Not simple ""How are you doing?"" Type stuff, because those should expect ""Fine"" as an answer.   Something that he would want to answer.

It is possible he's a douche, but he may also feel he is not interesting enough, or that you would not like what you find out about him.

Edit:  I have very limited context, so could be off base.  Up to you to decide if you want to find out."
soc_218994,socialskills,reddit_comment,941,"Ive been working on making people around me feel better. It means being able to give compliments to people ive just met while sounding genuine and not looking like you are working an angle.

First thing is you need to be comunicating in a language the person you are speaking to can understand.

Us men use overt communication. Say you and me are in a room talking and someone else is in there. We want privacy so one of us will ask for the room.

Say two women are talking and want the room. Women use covert communication. This means they will stop talking and expect you to take the hint and leave.

Now im talking to a girl I really like. I did not know I liked her the day we met; but that night while we were texting I said ""I hope this is not too forward; you are really pretty""

With men and women I just met if things are going well I openly say ""Not to be weird or anything; I like you""

Its a good practice to as acknowledge and potential awkwardness that saying something might cause right before you say it. People can have some pretty atrocious social habits these days and an obscene amount of things can make people feel awkward. If you acknowledge the potential awkwardness before hand you two will be on the same page after the comment namsayin? 

Remember attractive women are used to attracting men. It is to the point that they safely assume that you have a sexual interest in them. Not all women think this.

Take this girl I like. She is beautiful however she did not see herself as someone men take interest in because she does not have feminine habits.

Enough context and on to the main jawn you feel me?

You are interested in a woman and you wsnt to let her know. You do not want to be rejected and she does not want to have to reject you. Some women get off on doing it however most know it hurts and dont and to hurt you. If they are not interested however it must be done.

Your best bet is to not put her in a position where she has to outright reject you. You remember overy and covert communication? You need to decide what is the best option. There is no magic set of lines that is going to make this happen. Think of this skill more like a tool and less like a key.

Showing that you are enjoying her company in ways she can pick up on will tell her you are interested. She will feel more comfortable around you knowing you like her company.
I have a hard time initiating touch and it is a skill i try to work on. If you are comfortable with it; touch is a powerful way of establishing and building a strong rapport. It will show interest. A hug says friendship. Putting your arm around her says you are interested. She will become comfortable with this over time as you escalate from a hug to an arm to kissing her or cuddling. Both say you are interested. This is done slowly over the evening you teo are together. If she becomes uncomfortable she will stop you. If she resists it will be proportional to how aggressively you escalated.

Say you had an arm around her for a while, you two were on the couch chillin and watching some netflix and you slide your hand down into her ass. She will just pull it back up to her back.

Say you met her a few minutes ago and try and do the same thing it can range from her telling you not to do that to getting slapped or cussed out ya dig?

Now overtly you can tell her you would like to get to know her better. If you do not have a strong rapport with her; doing something that is too much like a date puts her in a position where she will have to overtly reject you.

Asking her out to dinner for example. Also you can not initiate touch sitting across from her.

If you go shoot pool you can sit at the bar between games and initiate there. Then you can back off for a bit, play a game and escalate more on the next break.
Also ""Hey you want to go shoot some pool"" sounds a lot less committal than ""Would you like to have dinner with me""

Even better ""Hey i am going to go shoot some pool if you would like to come with me"" Now women are tuned into WIIFM... Whats in it for me?

Do not try too hard but sell the idea.

""I am gonna go shoot some pool if you would like to come with me. There is a new place I am checking out. They have lots of tables. It is more of a bar than a pool hall so the tables are free. There is a dance floor and a DJ  on friday night. People in that area are really friendly too. There is a great pizza place next door with garlic knots to die for. I might not even want any and i will grab a few if I am in the area.""

Showing interest is a process and best done slowly. That does not mean you hesitate. It means you take your time and do it right. It is a lot more than ""I find you attractive and would like to take you out on a date"" nahmean?"
soc_1248642,socialskills,reddit_comment,287,"Dude. You're literally looking for stories of others who are 'in the same boat' as you. I've seen your other posts. Finding people in a similar situation is the biggest mistake you can do.  

&gt;Yes everyone's situation is different but as I look around for advice I find no one understands this issue because they never lived it.

There you go. That's the point. No one will understand because they're not you. Branching out or getting out of your comfort zone will not help you if you're just forcing yourself. Trying too hard to fit in will just make it seem that you're not genuine. And people don't like that. 

&gt;Most people had the luxury of having friends introduce them to new shows, video games, movies or get them in to sports back in the day. If you grow up isolated you fall out of the loop. an example of this in my life is a pal in middle school who introduced me to T.I. when I could have easily missed it otherwise.

This right here is totally irrelevant. Who cares what you like and dislike? If you're a genuine guy I won't care about those. You're a late bloomer? Also totally irrelevant. You have autism? IRRELEVANT. Stop using them as an excuse. Stop making excuses in general.

You have a problem with your attitude man. It's the way you look at things. Unless you address that then you are a lost cause. You see your issue as if any external solutions can solve it. That's what I meant by be a friend to your self first. The root of the problem is within you. And the solution is also within and you're totally missing the point."

I mean, I don’t drink for a lot of reasons (most of them really dark) but that doesn’t mean I’m going to rip that chapter of my life open just because I feel the need to explain. 

If they can’t deal with you not drinking, then that’s their decision but real friends would still invite you and not want you to explain. 
I know mine don’t, they just offer to make sure that the places offer water, juice, soda of something. 
Besides I think it’s always a good idea to have a sober person around when going out on case someone gets really drunk or they start making stupid decision (like driving) then you’re being the sensible one and they’ll probably thank you for not drinking and stopping them when they sober up.

I don’t really enjoy alcohol too much even now, myself, but it would have been nice if I could have brought myself to be around drinking/drugs just to hang out with people and have fun even if I wasn’t partaking in it.

soc_1685259,socialskills,reddit_comment,147,"It's personal preference at that point, imo. A person is free to be as polite as they want, but as a bank teller, she already pushed beyond the politeness boundary by 1) not taking steps to get OP the denominations they requested in the first place, 2) by not letting them count it on the spot, and 3) by insisting they put themselves in a poistion to be short their own money and essentially unable to prove they were, particularly with such a large amount. 

So she is either incredibly rude and uncaring, or extremely incompetent. In either case, I would say anybody would be in the right to not extend her any niceties and a bit of curtness is in no way unreasonable or ""petty"".

soc_37332,socialskills,reddit_comment,354,"What really helped me when I had this problem was gaining confidence in myself. I found that faking confidence eventually led me to simply having confidence. Focus on the good things about you, perfect them, and then project them outwardly to other people. Even if you don't think something is great about you yet, pretend like it is and other people will see it that way! (Like if you think you're too tall or something, just make jokes about what advantages it has.) It's hard at first, but it's all about giving off a certain kind of aura. If you are timid and standing awkwardly with your hands in your pockets, people don't want to go up to you themselves. Stand like you are an important person. Make people want to talk to you, and when they do, make them want to impress you. When they want to do this, they will generally talk more and you can get into better conversations. With girls, start with a typical conversation starter, and then give them a backhand compliment. Such as to a blond ""You're hair is gorgeous. I'm surprised the bleach hasn't killed it yet."" This causes them to either want to correct you, or defend their, in this case, hair. They typically won't walk away from a sentence they're unsure how to take. Yes, it sounds like an asshole when you type it out like this, but as a girl I know it works when the guy has a confident aura about him. Trust me, I've fallen for something similar.

What you have to know about other college students is that no one has quite figured themselves out yet. And when they see someone who seemingly has, their interest is peeked. Now I'm not saying to pretend to be someone you're not- What I'm telling you is that you need to discover who you are, accept it, and be confident about it, no matter if you think others will like the real you or not. If they don't like you, you shouldn't care, but if they do then you've just made a new friend."

soc_829439,socialskills,reddit_comment,439,"Honestly, what you did doesn't sound too bad (yanno, aside from the obvious ""cheating is bad"" thing). It sounds like you repeatedly tried setting a boundary after you cheated and he was still desperate to be with you that he was still giving you gifts, making attempts to make you stay, even trying to meet up when his new gf was out of town after you already told him you didn't want to be with him anymore.

Him going to social media and insta to defame you is a weak move. He's turning people against you rather than healing by accepting his part in it, realizing the mistakes you made, maybe never understanding but at least respecting your choice to not be with him anymore, and moving on in a healthy way. It seems like he's still not over this situation based on the pettiness of his actions which is fine, but not your fault or problem.

It seems like maybe things weren't left in the best place. If you want to tell him that you're back in the scene, it probably couldn't hurt just to be like hey you might be seeing me around or whatever and just wanted to give a heads up. It at least acknowledges that you're aware of the awkwardness of the situation and just wanted to confront it head on. If he seems like it's no big deal then it's safe to say he's moved on and you can be there in peace. You could also just wait until you feel that you need to talk to him about you coming back (like if an incident happens or something) because he doesn't need to know what you're up to and if he's so concerned about it then I'm sure one of his followers has already told him and he knows and he'd confront you about it if it was an issue. If he does, you can tell the truth and say that you enjoy this hobby and just want to get back into it and want to be civil with him. Again, if he's over it, it should be fine. If he's angry or mean, he's probably not over it.

In regards to trusting the others, I'd keep your guard up and maybe try and branch out from his social circle to others in the hobby that aren't involved in the drama. Or just keep on keeping on, but just be wary of who you get close with from his friend group because you never know, but trust your judgement there because paranoia and lack of trust is obviously not great for friendships."
soc_1324728,socialskills,reddit_comment,592,"I think some motivational videos on YouTube and listening to those every day for at least 30 mins. for a year will help you and also some of the videos give you an idea on how to make goals for yourself too.

I suggest also this book:

The gifts of imperfection: let of of who you thin you're supposed to be and ebrace who you are.

You an over thinking and hyper paying attention to everyone's life except yourself. You don't want to make waves or be noticed. Well you have just as right as everyone else to take you your space.

I was really picked on when I was a kid and as adult I have struggled with this my entire life but a few years ago my mother passed away and it really woke me up. I don't care look all you want and make a face. I am going to enjoy my life. ( most of the time they are jealous they are brave enough to try...they are scared. We use anger to hide how scared we are by the way.) We have such a short amount of time and you really don't realize it.

So when your really old and look back on your life do you really want to say. You didn't do much but worry about people who are not even there anymore and can't even remember their names of faces. It's our mind doing a lot of ""What If's"" that are not even there. So you giving yourself anxiety for no reason at all. ( a Will smith does a good video on jumping form a plain that you should listen too)

To stop this you need to focus on some goals for yourself. The motivational videos are good because they start to slowly retrain your mind for be more positive and realize your choosing to be sad and miserable. You choosing to keep that person in your life and your choosing to stay in a dead end job. You need to stop being in denial. If you really want out of it and you really want to stop having others that are in your mind making you feel less of a person. You need to **STOP**. Anytime you get those thoughts. Stay **STOP** and then go do something else and if your in a place where you can do something you like then go do that. If your not think of what fun things you can do later  when you get off work or when you get home. Think of having your day off and that you have something planed...to look forward too. Like a movie, video game, talking to family ect. read a book.

I like to stay to myself, "" today is going to be a good day and good things are going to happen to me."" When something gets stressful. I take a deep breath and tell myself I can get through this and it's not worth worrying about. When you think about it their are a lot of other things you should be worrying about.

You can also google out questions you might have and find more about over thinking and they give you steps on how to handle it. But only YOU can make your life better. No one else can. It's personal choice and if you want to continue to feel sorry and bad about yourself you will. You have to realize you don't want that anymore and you have to work on it daily. Just like exercising."

When I say that I’m selective I just mean that I won’t be friends with someone simply because they’re there or bc I can or bc I want something from them.

Look. The point of knowing people first is to get over the barrier of wtf stranger. Asking out acquaintances is fine. Masquerading friendship to get sex is what upsets people. 

There's a fine line and it depends on the person where they feel betrayed about your friendship never really existing in the first place. It's a hard balance.

If you don't wanna date or fuck, ask them to more friend events. Other people, less intimate, things they'd enjoy. 

If you are planning on getting to know someone to make them more comfortable being asked out, just keep in mind that's like work friend or acquaintance levels not like actual friendship. If you are the dude who is like you MUST date me I've been your friend for years you'll have a bad time.

Edit: MeetUp and other group events might help for more friends. 

Tbh the invite them out with friends thing doesn't even have to be actual friends, it can be (for a very dorky example) the anime convention team is playing all the studio ghibli movies at the movie theater wanna go? Or trivia night at pub. Or whatever other thing that isn't intimidate and date like."
soc_1140054,socialskills,reddit_comment,221,"I wouldn’t say I’m fully an extrovert, I’m definitely a mix of both and this helps me to understand and to appreciate a quality interaction with an introvert person. I love to listen and exhange thoughts in that case. 

However, I don’t think comparing a behaviour with a personality trait is exactly accurate. Simply put, in the example you mentioned, those people were mostly taking advantage of your kindness. This is not an ‘extrovert trait’. This is just the way they were raised as people, which is not a quality way to be. 
You can find this behaviour often sadly and it’s up to you to chose what people you want to keep close in your life. 

Also, at 13-14 years old you were barely a teen and it’s pretty hard to judge someone’s behaviour at that age, as puberty it’s supposed to shape us as future adults, therefore we can experience various behaviours before we discover ‘who we really are’ - so the people you knew at 13 years old can really be quality nice adults now at 23 years old. 

Just because some past experiences were really painful, it doesn’t mean they need to define and affect us forever. We grow, things change, we deserve and we will get better. It’s up to us to work for it too."

Have hobbies/interests and be passionate about them.

&gt;emotionless

If you're like me it's simply called being stoic. Look up the philosophy and see if it's for you. There's nothing wrong with that. I consider it a strength. I minimize the impact of negative events and maximize my happiness by having an objective approach to how I build my life.

&gt;lacking in personality.

I used to try and hide my flaws because I thought they'd make me more liked. I learned (by reading books like No More Mr. Nice Guy) that it makes you unrelatable because people won't know what makes you, you. Instead try to be open about your flaws. ""This is me, and these are my weaknesses - I don't have a problem as long as I keep working on them"". This makes you relatable because you'll come off like every other human being on this planet.

Remove any shame you have. You have nothing to hide. Everyone is on a path in life, and yours took you to right where you are now. The only thing that matters is that you know that the next steps you take are up to you. Do what you can to take them in the direction you want."

And if what they think is constructive criticism, you don’t need to be offended by that. You can accept it or accept it and try to grow or just write it off. It’s literally up to you.

I like learning about things people do, their perspective, how they feel about those things and then relate that back to my own personal feelings. From there, I either find similarities to continue the conversation, or dig a little deeper into the things that are different.

So for example, if I met someone who was a professional billiards player (something I have no idea about), I'd probably ask, ""How'd you get into billiards?"" ""What do you like about it?"" ""Who taught you how to play?"" 

And in this hypothetical situation, the conversation could spin off into how their father used to teach them, and his father is a veteran and learned billiards in a VA hospital.. and so on.

I kind of liken it to pulling a thread. You're unraveling people's shells where they open up to you in the spirit of authentic connection.

I don't confront people about why, because the why isn't the interesting part. I just want them to do it. If there were to be any confrontation, it would simply be me asking ""Hey, could you maybe ask more questions when I volunteer info about my life? It feels like you aren't interested in me."" and a good friend would take that to heart. I don't need someone to make me the center of attention, I just want people to follow up on things that I say at all. Even one question after I say something about my summer plans or whatever is good enough for me. It's just kind. 

Everyone is different, so maybe you don't need ppl to ask questions, and I am happy for you if that's the case. I rely heavily on validation from others because of my anxiety issues, but that doesn't mean I'm begging and pleading for them to ask about my life. I just want to be able to see interest. This isn't even a desire I have expressed to other people. It's something I have been quietly working on for years because I know that it's not a healthy way to live. But, it's a part of me.

I usually volunteer info about myself in the middle of a convo where it's pertinent, or when there is a lull in the convo between subjects. In either case, I don't want to dominate the convo, I just want to add on or start a new subject.

soc_357123,socialskills,reddit_comment,333,"Absolutely! Dating apps are a nightmarish hellscape of rejection and self-doubt. However, it's also an opportunity to date people completely outside your social circles. This is great for a few reasons. 

First, I've met a wide variety of people which helps you know what you are specifically looking for instead of just the vague notion of a relationship. Second, you need experience. You're going to make awful embarrassing mistakes and learn what about yourself is attractive and worth highlighting. There's no book, podcast, reddit post etc that'll teach you this in depth, only experience and reflection. In addition to that inner experience, there's an external knowledge of where to go, what to do, and matching where/what with a specific type of person. Third, when you're out there dating and can talk about it with the people in your life, they know what you're looking for. Tinder etc may be a shitshow for finding someone perfect, but you're signaling to those that know you best to be on the lookout for someone to hook you up with.

A lot of this boils down to the fact that dating is a process. It's the tree in that proverb ""the best time to plant a tree is twenty years ago, the second best time is right now."" The fruit of that tree is potent too. Oh the stories! The wonderful stories, the funny stories, the ones that still make me cringe hard! Here is where dating strangers is great:  you get to decide which dating stories your friends know about. I think there's a wisdom in sharing that which makes you cringe hardest... but, you don't have to! As long as you don't fuck up so bad that you get ""seven degrees of Kevin Bacon'd,"" it'll be your choice who knows what and you can take some secrets to the grave.

Maybe this post seems upbeat, so I'll leave you with this:  you're gonna die one day, you should make out with someone before then.

You said he is in therapy and getting better. This means he is already aware of the problems and is working on them. What he needs is you to support him. Part of what that means is letting him take small steps to overcoming his fear. What you're trying to do is take someone who's afraid of water and throw them into the deep end of the pool just when they were almost ready to wade in past their knees. 

You want him to know he can trust you, but if he thinks you're going to try and force him into doing something that  terrifies him to the point of tears, he's going to stop opening up to you. 

All that said, I don't think confronting his fears is a terrible idea. He just needs to start way smaller. Encourage him to have small conversations with the cashier at the grocery store, ask him more questions to get him talking more, make ""no phone"" rules when you hang out with friends or go out, etc. It sounds like he's doing his best so just be patient and kind and he'll continue to improve."

Once you figure who you are, then you need to decide who you want to become.

Only when you make decisions to change can you actually change.  Once you've decided to change, then  you need to plan how you're going to change.  A new hair cut.  A different wardrobe.  Lose/gain weight.  Contacts vs. glasses.  Etc.

A lot of people will think we’re corny simply because of how we speak. It comes off as 🧢. 

To be honest, I don’t blame them, it’s so culturally indoctrinated it’s hard to see it any other way unless you’ve travelled extensively or grew up outside of that way of thinking. 

What worked for me was going back to my roots and really understanding how to communicate and express myself in a way that is most natural but also most effective to those who may not have a similar educational background. It’s like being proficient in a multiple dialects in Spanish, except it’s plain old English

Also, don’t put too much stress on being someone’s friend just because they’re black. You should want to be friend’s with someone who you can click with and communicate without either party taking things too personal. If you feel that puts you in a pool of not being able to be friends with many black people cause of your interests - then so be it. 

Also, if someone clowns you for being you, either dish it back or cut it off. Your choice. It’s common in our culture to mess with someone for their differences, so something like talking white, which in context is most likely a small minded way of thinking, is just an easy grab for them .

Get in shape. Your body is the only one you get, and when it's gone, so are you, so you might as well have one you're proud of and that will serve you well and carry you far. Some of what the others are saying are a bit too specific, I'd think, and is more focused on /r/fitness topics, but pretty much it boils down to eating healthy and getting exercise. If you're too big, do cardio and cut down on food, if you're too small, eat more and lift.

Do activities to be proud of, that'll make you feel better about yourself and give you something to talk about and throw yourself into. Volunteer, build things, join a group, ect. You're already in college (which is something to be proud of already), so join clubs, go to whatever events your campus is hosting, ect. Anything that lasts and gives back to the community is an added plus, as you can look back on it and know YOU have made the world a better place.

Force yourself to socialize. A drama improvisation class helped me with this big time, but really, any group or club or class or job where you have to talk to people, will do. I recommend you take a public speaking or leadership or drama class this upcoming semester.

Check out /r/getmotivated, /r/socialskills, and other motivation/selfhelp/selfimprovement sites and boards. The important thing, it's to be who you want to be. If you don't like your looks, change them. If you're stupid, grab a book. If you don't think you're funny, join a comedy club, any problem or excuse you have you can fix.

You are you. Nobody else knows your hopes, your fears, your insecurities but you, and they can't, unless you show them. It's entirely up to you to be who you are. And no amount of Reddit or any other guide will help you unless you take their advice and go out there and try it.

You clearly feel quite hurt and wronged, which sucks. I think it also sucks that you’re so raw that you’re reacting to me this way. You different expectations that the other folks on your story. You also clearly don’t feel much empathy or sympathy for them, at least as you describe them here. You believe you are right, and “they” are wrong. You believe “they” think you are wrong. It’s obvious both that you feel disappointed and why you feel disappointed — your expectations were not met.

When I look at the situation from that frame, all your options suck. Either you walk away, or you deliver an ultimatum and in doing so burn a lot of good will and risk a very likely kick in the ego if they choose the highway over your way. Or you can bottle it up and be angry and sad, which also sucks. 

On the other hand, if you reframe your situation — perhaps by seeing if there is a way to negotiate a mutually beneficial 3 way compromise — your options improve substantially. 

My point — that you need to like these people enough to make that compromise worth seeking, and which doesn’t seem to be the case — that still holds. Only you know if continued investment, and under what circumstances, makes sense or not for you. If you like these folks enough to want to keep them in your life, reframing to also include *why* you like them, why time spent together is valuable, etc. will help immensely. And if you can’t find those reasons, why spend time together?"
soc_1744742,socialskills,reddit_comment,395,"I am afraid there isn't a magic fix. Every flaw each one of us has is only removable through a process of repeated failures and lessons that come from those failures. 

When I was young I was a total jackass and clueless about it. I felt I was god's gift to humanity, and didn't hesitate to demonstrate it to those around me.

As I learned more about how I negatively impacted people I came in contact with (mostly through the results I got), I started tweaking parts of my personality.

I'm 47 now, and while I still discover new shitty things in my personality every so often, I know that I have very little in common with the guy I used to be 25 years ago.

You have 4 out of 5 things going for you though:

1. You still have friends who are willing to call you out on it. Make amends and try to keep those people close to you; they are your greatest asset.

2. You are aware you have shortcomings. The world is rife with jackasses who are utterly incapable of introspection. Celebrate the fact you are not one of them.

3. You seem genuinely interested in becoming a better person, and the fact you are posting this tells me you've already started your journey.

4. You have a gift of confidence that comes with your self-image. This is an aspect of your personality that can be put to good use. People may call you a incurable asshole today, but no one can tell you that you can't change, and you fucking know it 😎. That minimizes the oh-this-can't-be-fixed-so-why-try negative self-talk. On top of that, career-wise, relationship-wise, etc, confidence is gold if you take the time to calibrate that aspect of yourself. Just be mindful that this literally is the dark side of the force. Just don't make people like Roger Stone your idols lol; feeling of confidence is seductive and it can be a slippery slope.

5. The fifth necessity for change is acceptance that personal growth is a life-long journey. I'm still a flawed, broken person, but I'm working on it. And that's what makes any of my undesirable traits only temporary. That's what keeps the growth perpetual and the journey bearable.

I had a good friend group all throughout school that I met when I was around 5, and we were friends every since. Things weren't great for me, but I always at least had my group to joke around with and have fun and feel comfortable.

I think in my mind I saw going to college as my fresh start but I didn't make any friends and felt like no one here was anything like me. I fell into depression which made things worse and spent most of my first two years in my room. I feel like I need so little to be happy, just a friend or two that I feel good around, but things just haven't worked out.

The people giving advice here are right, its important to focus on and put forward the positive aspects of yourself. Thing is, I get that that isn't easy at all. I think its hard when you take yourself out of the world for a while to ramp up and get onto the level of other people. I used to be so fun and I feel like I just don't have that energy anymore.

I think a good thing is to be ready to talk about yourself. Think of some cool things you have done recently. You said you have lots of dreams and interests, be ready to talk about that, and do it with confidence. I feel like I always shy away from getting exited about talking about things I like because I feel like no-one will care but its up to you to make them care.

Lastly, you said that no-one would want to be your friend because you think they will see you as a difficult friend. Are you? For what reason do you think this? Its very possible that you are difficult to be friends with because of your depression. The thing is, if someone isn't wanting to be your friend because of that, realsise its not you they don't like, but they just find it challenging and probably aren't sure what to do. I know I sometimes ignore texts or don't respond with much because I'm super insecure. Well if I had a friend like that I would just assume they didn't like me. I think its important to accept that maybe you are a bit challenging to be around, but you should keep reaching out so people know that you want to, don't leave them guessing. I don't think I put what Im trying to say into words very well, but maybe you get the point.

I know how lonely and isolating college is first hand. Its not the same as having friends you know and where you are but if you ever want to talk about those plans or dreams, it would light up my day to get a message.

I hope things get better. Its one thing to read advice and know what to do, but another to actually put it into practise.

Putting yourself out there means actually going out and meeting people where ever that may be. We can't tell you that because only you know what you like. Being shy is good and all, but it's a luxury only independent and introverted people can afford.

soc_875955,socialskills,reddit_comment,442,"Friendship grows from repeated nice encounters where you both enjoy each others company. If it's repeated niceness and going out of their way to be with you then it could be something more than just being polite. If it's just niceness then see you later, then it's probably just being polite and respectful. 

If you enjoy their company and start treating them as a friend, that's perfectly fine. I recommend that actually. Just be alert to anything that says they don't want that relationship with you, e.g. You invite them to lunch and they decline a couple of times. That's cool, and you know where you stand. If you suggest one kinda friend thing and noticing that they're uncomfortable with that idea, and that's cool too. You just have pay attention to them and they will tell you what they want from how they respond, what they say, how they react from there on, etc.

I guess, you also need to be alert to how people interact normally. If that guy who's usually a dick to everyone suddenly sidles up to you and is super friendly, atleast you can think hmm this is out of character for him. Likewise, being suspicious of niceness isn't very healthy. It depends on the environment dramatically. Some people are brought up to be nice to everyone all the time, some are taught to be nice while you're in their immediate area and they never notice those people otherwise, some arent taught about niceness, etc etc. I personally used to struggle with the second one; that kind of 'I'm nice and friendly right now but outside of this room you don't exist to me' kind of niceness. It isn't malicious, it's just how they treat things.

As hard as it is, I personally say you should only be suspicious if niceness if you have a good reason to be. And wanting the niceness to be something more is fine, as long as you accept that not everyone wants that and that you pay attention to how they react to things. If they don't want that, that's perfectly okay, you don't have to push further for it.

Edit: I think the key thing is, friendship isn't an easy thing to just form, atleast for me. There is no one action that says, we're friends now. You just have to be ready that some friendly and nice people will not always want to be friends. And that sometimes you have to push to find where that boundary is and sometimes it will be very clear from how they niceness only seems to exist in certain situations and not others."

Sure, it's better if you have one, but whereas one side is being callous and disrespectful in their behavior, assuming that you have to have closure and hounding the other person for it can be downright dangerous .

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I see this as not standing up for yourself. I'm not trying to be contrarian, but why do you think it's unhealthy? there's plenty of other ways that people hurt us and it's a given that we should confront those who hurt us and stand up for ourselves. why is this different?

Great. I see it as saying ""OK, now I know that person is worthless. Time to move forward."" It's unhealthy because you're obsessing over somebody else's (lack of) concern for you to even give you the decency of a minimal 'thanks for the text/call/date, but this isn't working out for me. Have a great life' message.

This is different because they haven't actually done anything to us, just opted to cut off all contact. Sure, it can hurt, but they're also completely under their own prerogative to do so, and, technically, owe you nothing at all. Legally, they've done you no wrong (I'm assuming.) Morally and ethically, it's anti-social behavior that is terrible, but alas, it's not a crime to be an asshole (unfortunately.)

Anonymity also helps; it's pretty easy to just drop out from contact with someone you may have never even met and not have to worry that statistically they're unlikely to ever see you again."
soc_1803507,socialskills,reddit_comment,114,"Exactly this. I live in a part of England where it's not uncommon for someone your grandma's age would call you 'my loverrrr' (extra Rs added for accent). If you go 200 miles up the road it's 'bab', another 100 miles it's 'cock' or 'hen' depending on gender.
It's entirely up to you if you take it badly or not, it's just how people interact in that area. No, I would not consider taking 99.9% of women who call me 'my lover' as a lover. At the same time, I'd rather they called me 'my lover' than 'sir' because 'sir' is what we called abusive teachers in school or *spits on ground* police officers"

If you want an ego boost, you can ask them specifically in what ways you improved between your first and second practice interview with them. They'll each have different advice, and it's up to you which suggestions you'll use. But practicing an interview 4 times will give you experience you need.

No woman can make you happy. They can enhance it, or in some cases maybe unlock your potential to be happy, but it is up to you to find the things that make you feel fulfilled in life.  A skill, a trade, an endeavor with personal significance,  acts of kindness. Be patient but with action. You must seek these things,  tirelessly but with your mind focused on the present. That is my belief."

Although! If you say you guys have many mutual interests and run in each other quite a lot, take that as your advantage I guess. Since you have apologized, try to forgive yourself - it's only natural people make silly mistakes that affect others, it happens and I hope you have learned something from it. But anyway, you can still prove yourself in their eyes that you are trustworthy and you made a mistake. One day they might realize that whatever you did can be forgiven since you've proven that you really want to stay in the group of those friends.

soc_1625843,socialskills,reddit_comment,158,"A comedian can be telling abortion jokes while the audience laughs throughout but the second he brings up a certain religion or race that offends a particular group in the audience all the sudden it’s angry little finger pointers crossing their arms and frowning to the same person they were just laughing with. If a joke is funny, it’s funny to the person telling it no matter what, but if a person getting told the joke gets personally offended by it, their butthurtedness will prevent the joke from being received as funny and thus the comedian is shamed and forced to apologize. It’s lame. I don’t think you should have to tell your FRIENDS that you were just making a joke. If a joke turns from humor to insult in their minds, they’re probably not too good of friends. Jokes aren’t insulting, they’re simply making fun. Just my two cents. Jokes are funny and people are too sensitive."
soc_1751132,socialskills,reddit_comment,483,"Hey OP: a little advice from someone just a little younger than you.

First off: I’m a woman. I’m gonna tell you what I think as a 20yr old

Second: what another comment said, it sure as hell doesn’t matter that your “friends” who are laughing at you, get laid or not. I can only imagine the type of girls they manage to sleep with, and I guarantee no one in any of those situations are actually happy sleeping with one another, man or woman.

This is just my opinion, but I don’t sleep with people unless I feel a genuine connection with them. Finally “getting rid of the virgin card” is so unbelievably unrealistic my guy. Women, GOOD women, who you want to date and care about and love, and who treat you with the same love and kindness, do not care about whether you are a virgin or not. And this goes for every single guy on this subreddit that feel like they can’t date or are embarrassed about not having sex before.

I chose to date my boyfriend now because I thought he was sweet and kind and overall good person. I did not care that he never had a girlfriend before me, I did not care that he had never had sex with a girl before me. I actually preferred it that way, and I knew what he was all about before we started dating. I thought it was really cute and I was a bit turned on to know I would be his first.

I can’t say I can read the minds of the men on this sub that feel upset they can’t date or embarrassed about being virgins, but I want you to know, especially you OP, that a woman worth your time will not think of you any differently if you don’t know what you’re doing in the bedroom. It’s completely okay to be nervous! Women prefer if you be upfront with them and tell them that you’ve never had that experience before! It shows you can be honest and trustworthy, and it’s a lot better than “acting like you know what you’re doing” and possibly making everything awkward. (Like how I imagine your “friends” might be going about it. I bet you ten bucks if you talk to the girls those guys slept with, they’d be like “the sex was eh” because the guys acted all macho.)

All of this to say: men of the sub and OP: please don’t think women want men that sleep with a bunch of people, or date a bunch of people. It’s honestly a major turn off for me to think that a person I’m interested in has slept with like 20 people before me. What the hell would make me any different, ya know? I’m in it for the long run, and a good partner would be too"
soc_1093665,socialskills,reddit_comment,186,"&gt; “maybe this can change at some point,” 

Whenever someone says something like this they are always (in a misguided way) trying to soften the blow. 

You don't take it personal by recognizing and believing that it isn't personal, because it's not. Not everybody is going to click or vibe with you, the vast majority of people that anyone meets will not be people who they click or vibe with. If you can genuinely say that you click or vibe with everyone you meet then you don't meet very many people. You may also have the issue that some people here seem to have where they think it is desirable and possible to be liked by everyone, it's not possible and it's not desirable. It's not possible because everyone is different and has different tastes in people and to make yourself palatable to everyone you are making yourself the blandest, most boring person in existence in order not to offend anyones tastes and no one truly likes someone who is bland because there's nothing to actually create interest in you hence why it is not desirable."
soc_1021267,socialskills,reddit_comment,624,"I think first you have to accept that it's totally ok to have your space. Introvertedness (is that a word?) is fine as long as you don't feel uncomfortable being by yourself. But it's good to have some people you can rely on and feel comfortable with.

When making friends or meeting people, remember: only you are responsible for your own happiness. Don't let other people dictate how you feel (to the best of your ability). Of course there's going to be people who don't think well of you, you just have to accept that. Pleasing everyone is a chore that you will never complete. With that said, you should be wanting to improve yourself. If you find that you have some quality that you know isn't good and other people dislike ( something like bad breath or tendency to leave things everywhere) try to improve on those areas. People will always let you know what they don't like about you directly or indirectly; it's up to you to decide if it's something you want to improve on for yourself or to just leave it as a part of you. 

In the way of forming relationships, I'd say make small talk with anyone you can, especially those coworkers. Just try finding out a little more about people and keeping the conversation going. This should help build some social skills. It doesn't have to be much, just ask how people are, ask for a little help even if you can do it alone, compliment people on achievements no matter how small, and say hellos and goodbyes. People will appreciate you a bit more and you'll find out who you like or don't like.

If you do end up making some small talk, maybe sneak in some question about your interests. Ask if they play any games or what music they listen to/are listening to. Then you can make an activity out of it. If its games, ask them for some recommendations. If they say they are good at something and you are interested, ask if they'd teach you or play with you. If it's something like music or reading,you can also ask for recommendations. Then next time you can give them feedback and ask them for more. This is really how friendships start. It's not something that is decided, it just kinda happens. But don't force yourself to be outgoing. Like I said before, you'll find out if you like these people based on these little talks. Don't try to bend your interests to fit theirs, that will make you miserable.

I don't think I'm good at helping people with issues like this, but i feel like I'd be able to help more if you provided a bit more information about why things might be the way they are.  Were you in an abusive home? Can you talk to people? How do your interactions usually go? Do you attempt doing anything social?

Disclaimer/TLDR: I'm writing this before I sleep so it's most likely disorganized and some parts won't make sense. But I'm basically saying to make small talk and just be organic with relationships and don't let people stress you out. Find out why this is suddenly bothering you and confront it. If you just want a change of pace then work at it. If you don't, then just remind yourself that it's ok to be who you are.

I do reccomend building some relationships with people that you can trust. Have some simple friends with mutual respect that would totally help you out because you might end up needing them at some point. It doesn't have to be a deep friendship, but be on good terms. Trust me, you never know what could happen."
soc_484284,socialskills,reddit_comment,159,"You're definitely not the only one. Even though I'm from the digital generation ('98) I dislike texting. Mainly because I like to play with language and this is easier in person. You have to speak clearly when texting. Also switching topics is difficult as there are no natural prompts. If you meet in person, you might see something special around you that leads to a change of topic, whereas if you're texting, you have to be direct and change a topic.

I personally don't text for fun (i.e. a long convo to catch up on life). I text data like meetings, tasks and use it to agree on a place to meet up with friends and then I can catch up with them in real life. This seems to work as I'm not missing out on anything and if a person really has something important to say, they'll call you or meet up with you.

soc_1133528,socialskills,reddit_comment,422,"These guys sound like they're still in highschool. I've had friends like this. Actually, it sounds almost spot on to all my highschool friends. I was the only one who didn't enjoy drinking, preferred to save and spend my money on experiences and travel instead of getting wasted every weekend.

The way they talk to you, is the way they think about themselves if they don't up hold their macho image; ""don't be a pussy"" ""man up"" ""don't be such a bitch"". Think about that... they talk to themselves like shit. The only way they'll feel better is if they're not alone in their own cesspool of degradation.

In my experience, I set up my own personal rules for life. Moral principles and things I wanted in life and if I didn't think it matched my future life, I tried to avoid it. I'm not saying you have to cut them out. You could even be the voice of reason. Tell them why you don't want to do these things. Stand up to them and call them out, even if you're the outcast of that group. You're only seen as the outcast cause it seems you want to make something of your life.

If you stand up for yourself, maybe Larry or Kevin are the scared boys they seem to be and can look up to you, even if it is in silence. I distanced myself from my highschool friends and slowly made new friends from work and sports teams. Eventually, one ended up having a breakdown and is alone, one came back and he turned his life around and now I'm standing in his wedding party, one became an alcoholic and didn't get clean for 12 years after highschool, one has no prospects, no savings, no education and chases women from the bars and gets used over and over and over again. The other one... I'm not even sure if he's above ground tbh.

My life... I was depressed. Hopeless being around people who felt like me inside. I was 340lbs and played WoW 16 hours a day. I had enough. I put my education to use, got a job, lost 140lbs, traveled the world, started mentoring around my city and fostered healthier relationships. We're all 33 now and out of the 5 of us, 2 of us tried to make our lives better. The other 3, still struggling, still doing the same shit.

soc_268804,socialskills,reddit_comment,563,"I'd say a few things. First, accept the compliments and just say thanks and move on. When asked how you do it, you can make a joke like watched a lot of Bill Nye growing up or good genes, my mom is brilliant. I'd do something like this versus any lies. People can smell them. 

When meeting people outside school, do what the kids at a lot of ivys do and say you go to school in Boston or Philadelphia. If people really care they will ask a follow up of what school? You can say something truthful that tries to be relatable - university of Pennsylvania- go fighting quakers! Or yes, I'm majoring in astrophysics, but still can't figure out how to program my TV to record The Voice (or some other TV show that you think is funny that you'd watch - Bachelor in paradise, Bones, the simpsons). Sure, I can discuss the structural integrity of a bridge, but I can't seem to get my dog to listen to me explain it. With correcting the professor, I think you did fine, I'd stick to making it about you - 'I want to make sure I understand the process, do you mind explaining .....' or can go self deprecating with 'I may need coffee, I'm not seeing how we got from here to there.' 

For people in school who you may be ahead of, don't brush it off with Kahn academy or something. You studied and figured it out. If they don't understand something they will usually be impressed and move on, or say something self deprecating about how they didn't get get it- giving you an opening to say something like that was me in my Shakespeare class. Very rarely they might be hostile and call you rain man or something. If they go there, they are showing you who they are - being kind of a dick - so I call them on it: 'this where you wanna be when Jesus come back?' Or '[insert name] Jeff, you've changed' (quotes from Joe dirt and jay mohr to give credit where due). Usually they will be taken aback for being called out and everyone can move on. It's your call, but once someone does something like this, you can decide if you want them in your life anymore and limit interaction moving forward. 

I too had friends and family that helped me stay grounded and the things I learned along the way are take a compliment with a thank you. Don't lie. When meeting new people, try to make your academic achievements relatable by sharing something funny about your school or major - people who can be intimidated by your achievements are because they don't know how to relate to your world, so tell them the truth in a way that it gives them an opening to relate to you - sports, tv, movies, pets, video games, etc. 

You teach people how to treat you. If you are nothing but a list of academic achievements, then it's hard to relate. If you are brilliant but still struggle to open a can of pickles or always lose your keys, you're relatable. It's okay to be honest about who you are - because there is something truly awesome about everyone - just make sure you're sharing your humanity as well as your achievements. "

With you, and forgive me for assuming, it seems like your brain makes you feel like an outsider, WHICH YOU ARE NOT!. Try next time to see what it is your brain is doing and recognize it as nothing more than a safety mechanism brought on by millions of years of evolution to keep you safe.

You can have great social skills and not be very successful.

To take the opposite example : people who are very extroverted spend the majority of their time in social situations ... so they don't need to ""practice"" being social and are naturally good at it ...

You make friends by having mutual interests or some sort of bond (school/college being common ones that draw people together) and maintaining consistent social interactions with them.

No one can give you the answer to this but yourself. It's also up to you to find out what you like. Try new stuff and see what you like to do. I didn't know how much I liked bowling until I tried it, and nowadays it's one of my go-to social activities.

Realistically, the people that run away from you because they think you look dumb, are exactly the type of people you want to run away. Genuinely happy people that can be a positive influence will never think you look dumb. They would probably look up to you  as they respect you trying something that you can't do.

 In terms of online convo which is relatively easier  just ask what songs do u listen to or something like that, send him link of some song that u like and what he/she thinks about it, send memes and after some time he/she will start opening up to you and after some time you can talk for hours about anything.
But remember only try to text/talk to a person if he too is reciprocating it , you don't want to come out as needy.
And believe me even if you know everything about that person ask basic question about their life (everyone loves to talk about themselves) and its a fact that  if someone acts interested in your life you sub consciously liking them. Questions go a long way in a conversation.

Yes, I did this a lot in the last years. But right now, it doesn't seem to work. Maybe because the things I compliment are taken for granted by people with high self esteem or maybe because they think (or know) that I'm not informed enough for the compliment to matter.

soc_736013,socialskills,reddit_comment,573,"Man, I am so happy and inspired to hear this story. I do have some advice for you here though, it sounds like she is quite into you, she could be just being friendly but let's look at it another way here. She opened up to you about how she feels about relationships and she also opened up about what she wants to which sounds like she would like to travel. Something I would do if I was in your place and something you should try is, make her see that being in a relationship with you will not be how she describes it to be, she says she doesn't want to be restricted. We all know that having a relationship isn't easy, it takes effort, time, energy and sometimes it takes struggle, but what if you could show her that being in a relationship with you will not be restricting, it will take a lot of effort from you, specially if it's your first relationship, but, HEY!!! This is the start of your new social life, it would not hurt to at least try something with her, you are into her and I can intuitively tell she is also into you, so give it a try.

I have some examples of what you would have to do.

* **You cannot let her see that you are jealous.** Even if you are, you can be jealous but jealousy is never a good thing in a relationship if it doesn't have a valid reason, maybe she says it would be restricting to have a relationship because it would not allow her to hang out with her friends, what you need to do is allow her to do that and you also get an opportunity to meet other people, build a network and have a better social life.
* **You need to be honest with her in all aspects of you. W**hatever you feel, whatever you want, you need to communicate that with her. There is nothing more frustrating in a relationship like miscommunication and dishonesty. 
* **Listen to her.** This is a big one, the reason why people get into a relationship is because they want someone to talk to, someone to share with, share their secrets, ideas, get their needs met and to feel safe and appreciated, you need to make her feel all this by being there for her and with her, physically and mentally.

I know this short list sounds like it's all about her and like you have to put all the effort, this is the thing. If you put this effort and she is not giving you that effort back, you need to back out, someone like that is never worth your time and energy, this is why you need to be open to meeting more people, not because you have her just settle with her and lock yourself and put her on a pedestal, keep your options open, meet people, go out have fun, have fun with her while you can and like I said, if she doesn't show the same effort back, back out or try to fix but in most cases it is very hard to fix a narcissist who is only thinking about themselves, take it from a former narcissist. Hopefully this advice improves your life and others, these rules don't just apply to your specific situation but they apply on every relationship. Congratulations again."

You mentioned that this person knows you love dogs and that you're a trainer, so I gathered that they are interested in what you have to say and value their expertise.

Sure, the first reaction might be disbelief, just like the first time Galileo told someone that the earth revolves around the sun. But it would be intellectually dishonest on your part to encourage and enable apparent dog abuse. Obviously, you are not happy about that either, so the best thing you can do is to be prepared for their challenges.

You can ask his sister nicely or desperately. It depends on how you communicate. I'd explain the situation in a normal way and tell her, if she could ask him.

I was bad in the past with keeping in touch and relied on friends to always contact me. I didn't even think this is an issue, because I was meeting people so it felt like it worked. To be more proactive and consistent I made [an app](https://amicu.app) with reminders.

I still have friends, who are worse at keeping in touch than me. Friendships only work with mutual interest. But mutual interest isn't defined just by reaching out. Some care about you, but have bad social habits.

There’s no way the other person can see me but they can tell that I’m smiling. Some people say it back just to not be rude, others don’t say anything, most of these encounters I get nervous energy from whoever I’m speaking with. I can definitely hear the difference when someone genuinely says it back with an enthusiastic tone.

soc_364339,socialskills,reddit_comment,649,"I'm going to be brutally honest with you. . . This doesn't sound like a personality disorder. You just have the perks of being a young woman in her twenties, neediness, entitlement and inexperience. Now, this isn't me insulting you, it isn't even necessarily a bad thing. We ALL begin needy, and entitled an inexperienced. It becomes a bad thing when you grow older and have still not gotten over this.

(I am not a professional, I am not a doctor, I am however experienced with people, and what they do and why they do it in both a scientific perspective and a street smart perspective. So, take this as you will.)



I'm willing to gamble that you want your boyfriend to look at you and only you because you feel like people don't acknowledge you for what you want them to see in you. When you feel he doesn't, you give him the cold shoulder and begin to cut communication from him.

Think about it, you have probably gotten by on looks alone, but it probably crossed your mind that what if your boyfriend meets a girl that looks just as good as if not better than you, what is stopping him from leaving? Do I really connect with him enough for him to stay for more than my body? 

Your need to be seen as something more than you are, and your ability to get upset over small things stems from entitlement, like their gaze should be on you based on something deeper than ""nice"", but they should not flood you with too much attention, because it makes you feel uncomfortable. You said you took a lot of selfies, because you like to be seen. But you want people to see more than just your physical presence, you want them to see something deeper inside on an individual basis.

You hate being the center of attention because you simply do not have the tools for dealing with it. It's like, have you ever had a stranger come up to you and try to drum up a conversation? I bet your eyes went wide and your lips went tight and you felt super awkward waiting for this person to go away, or am I wrong? 

Your mind is hungry for more. Your anger directed at your boyfriend and people over small things are just a byproduct of a bigger problem.

You aren't angry at people or your boyfriend or your boss, you're angry at yourself.

You're hungry. 

You aren't doing anything that you feel is significant, and its coming into a feedback loop that affects your self worth and your ability to communicate with people as well as be in the center of attention.

Now, you can fall into despair and think : ""What do I really do at the end of the day?"" 

Or you could go out and do something different. Throughout this whole thing I've heard about you, all I know is that you dislike people, and love animals. I think this is because animals can give you that unconditional feeling of good about yourself where as people always demand something.

You just need confidence. 

Shaking in front of people isn't a sign of anxiety disorder, I used to shake in front of strangers, I even used to hold my breath out of fear that they would judge me for breathing louder. 

Anxiety disorder comes with a different set of problems than you have told me about, pray you do not have it. X.x; 

That being said: Join a team, go out and party, take up a hobby. Above all, communicate with people. Nobody is going to do it for you.

At the end of the day, look at what you do and the set of problems that comes with it. 

Is this the set of problems you really want? No? Then do something else.

soc_1738347,socialskills,reddit_comment,256,"No that’s not what I’m saying at all. Cold approach is just the act approaching women that you don’t know. You can also cold approach while perceiving interest from the women. It merely refers to the approach itself, not necessarily the reason for approaching, but for the context of this post, the reason was def that she was attractive or interesting. 

Furthermore, cold approach isn’t a bad thing. It depends on how you do it. So even if you’re shy, it’s a good way to meet women (or men or others). And you’re right, it’s extremely hard to know whether someone is interested or not… that’s why you need to approach them and show interest by asking them out or for numbers etc.

Again all of this isn’t bad, but you need to do it the right way. That means being honest about your intentions, for example by stating that you approached her because you found her attractive. That also means accepting any outcome. So if she says she has a boyfriend or isn’t ready to date rn or gives you a cold “no thank you” or gets mad at you for some reason or simply walks away from you without even giving an answer… you need to accept that answer and move on. Just wish them a good day and leave. 

So yeah you can’t possibly know if someone is interested without asking, that’s why you gotta ask. The asking or approaching part is okay, as long as you do it in a respectful manner."

Being left out and patronized after a suicide attempt is not ok at all, you should have been asked what your preferences were upon your return to work, and it should have been your choice either to change anything or not. 

If I were you, I would talk to my manager, let them know I’m feeling excluded and that I’m not comfortable with the way my role has changed since I returned to work. If they don’t care, you should start looking for a new job despite the pay cut because your well-being is undoubtedly more important than your salary.

soc_1754031,socialskills,reddit_comment,253,"I think people revert to ""infantilizing"" certain activities, the terms don't only refer to actual age but also to maturity, which is constantly changing with context. For example having a night out is something a young person would do, not an adult with responsibilities, so people call it ""girls night out"" or ""boys night out"", basically allowing yourself to have childish fun as an adult. Someone might teasingly say ""the boys are having a game night"", but the same group doing hard labor would be ""the men are hard at work today"". Using girl or boy can be endearing and teasing, so it depends on your relationship to the person as well.

In terms of dating I think it's because we historically see dating as something young people do, we still use the terms girlfriend and boyfriend, and it gives it a ""young love"", childish and carefree kind of feeling. When it comes to marriage though we usually switch to the more mature man and woman. So it might go from ""I met a girl yesterday"" to ""I'm marrying the woman of my dreams"", etc.

This is my take on explaining the context and maybe it might help people decide which term they should use, and why for example its not cool to call their female colleague a girl during a meeting, even if she uses the term for her group of friends. I think people just intuitively understand this with men, but it just doesn't click that it also applies to women."

soc_1454765,socialskills,reddit_comment,318,"What you're going through is completely normal. Everyone is different and I think the first mistake you can make in your teens is to wish you were something other than yourself. 

If you want to work on your confidence, then the key is to work on yourself. I finished high school a complete introvert and very lonely because I couldn't understand how ""everyone else"" was doing it. I started with becoming the best version of myself and I found that once I focused more on that and less on trying to impress, people started gravitating towards me.

You won't need to try to be ""cool"" when you see yourself as ""cool"", and become friends with yourself. Treat yourself as your best friend. As for the sensitivity part, just try to work on dealing with the emotions that you feel as you feel them, and if you don't know how, then Google it. You'll be surprised by how much you can learn from the vast stores of knowledge on the internet.

There's no secret answer to your question, it's a matter of how you live your life. You're still super young, understand that, and also understand that you have a lot of growing to (potentially) do. It's all up to you. Try to establish pillars of character like discipline, integrity, perseverance, etc. 

As for you feeling spineless, this comes back to being good at something. If you're good at things, you're automatically going to generate opinions on those things, which leak out into the rest of your life. Get hobbies and be good at them.

Also, become really good at something. Preferably something you can use to make money out of, otherwise try to find a way to make money off of your skill. Almost anything is monetizable.

soc_1072640,socialskills,reddit_comment,470,"So... I am your friend/crush. Generally speaking, if a friend expresses being interested in me as more than a friend and I cannot reciprocate those feelings, I let the relationship go entirely. Part of it is simply that I've tried, numerous times when I was younger, to remain ""just friends"" and it was just never successful and often led to discomfort on my part and hurt feelings on theirs. Part of it is simply that it is that it just doesn't really feel authentic to me. When you say ""this pandemic has made me feel so lonely""... that's kind of how the motives always feel ime. It doesn't feel like you really want to be my friend... it feels like you're settling for being my friend because you can't have what you want and its better than nothing. 

Also, if you'd been friends for awhile; I know I at least always find myself questioning if we were EVER really friends. IK part of that is projecting because I am someone who knows swiftly if I'm interested in someone and I either pursue that or don't but by the time I become and remain friends with someone; a FRIEND is how I see them. I've never been friends with someone for any protracted period and then ""caught feelings"". Mentally, I know this is actually a thing. But emotionally... I find myself insecure that you always had those ulterior motives and the friendship was NEVER authentic and ALWAYS just a stepping stone, which erodes trust and sense of comfort and safety around that person.

I've never felt like someone's a piece of shit for expressing that interest. Tbh, I feel like its a far more POS move to NOT say anything and pretend like you feel a different way when you do in fact have those feelings. And it certainly doesn't mean I never cared about them. In fact, it doesn't even mean I don't care about them now... part of the reason for distancing myself is NOT wanting to feel like I'm leading them on. But loving someone, platonically or romantically, is not always sufficient to maintain a relationship regardless of all other factors. 

Is everyone like this? Of course not. But I do understand where your friend is coming from and am hoping sharing a bit of what the experience can feel like from the other side will help you to better empathize or have some closure.

My main point is... you did NOTHING wrong. Imo you handled yourself and the situation pretty much ideally. But... neither did they. Sometimes people's feelings just don't align and sometimes a relationship has run it course and yeah, that can hurt and kinda suck... but that doesn't mean anyone did anything wrong or that its not still the best, most reasonable, way forward."

soc_1618301,socialskills,reddit_comment,321,"To me, it seems like you might be insecure or lacking self confidence. You may not have social anxiety but these definitely sound like some things someone with social anxiety would experience, and it all stems from caring too much about what other people think of you. As someone with social anxiety, I always cringe at everything I do or avoid social situations because I think I'm embarrassing or I'm afraid of embarrassing myself. I'm not going to tell you to be ""yourself"" because I think personalities are dynamic and not fixed. However, I do suggest working on your self confidence, and while its easier said than done, don't care about what other people think of you. 

Also, my friend and I were having a conversation, and she had asked, ""Would you rather dance in a room filled with people you know, or filled with strangers?"" At first I thought obviously people I know, but when I really thought about it and imagined the situation I realized I rather dance in a room full of strangers. My close family and friends have this perception of me that I'm shy, anti-social and introverted. However, I actually crave going outdoors, having fun and socializing with people. Its my social anxiety that keeps me from doing those things. And my social anxiety is slowly getting better and the more it is, the more I feel the urge to go to parties and act differently. However, its hard to come out of the shell that other people have placed me in, because I fear their judgement or their accusations of why I am suddenly acting different. 

Overall, my point still stands. STOP CARING ABOUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK OF YOU. Live your life, break the rules, do whatever and don't give a fuck. It's gonna be hard, because I still struggle with it. Take it one step at a time and stop avoiding situations!! ❤️"

Some people, when they're young, dive into relationships because they look magical and special. I wouldn't recommend this, but it also helps you learn what kind of person you're actually more likely to be with, and what kind of person *you* are in a relationship.

I would say the fact she's opening up to you is a good sign, but I think it might be more just that you've shown her your hand, and now she's mulling over what kind of relationship you two can have. I've done it, friends of mine have done it, it happens. Don't expect anything, and don't be pushy. But open up to one another more, and see where you land.

I encourage you to make a mental note when someone banters with you and think of how you could have said a better response this mental exercise has proven very useful for me.

There are generally 3 key methods to respond to banter it will be up to you to decide which one to use in each scenario that comes with practice:
1) the best and most common method being: agree and amplify
2) the turn around
3) dismiss

agree and amplify: agree and blow up their question to absurdity, it is important to always banter smiling and joking never in a serious tone.

some examples to your chicken perdiciment:
agree and amplify: 'I dunno man I'm not feelin so in touch with my African roots right now, I haven't even had a watermelon today'.

turn around: 'Eh, I'm not really hungry right now, is your mind really on food again?' - take the pressure off yourself immediately and put it on them to answer back.

dismiss: simply scoff off the comment and change the subject right away after. don't be phased by their comment.

Unfortunately I don't really have much experience with befriending groups of people, but I imagine it's not quite as easy. Groups are probably much more casual in their discussions, so having common interests to talk about is more important. You said that you're more of a single player gamer while they're more into multiplayer, but you guys still share a common interest in video games.

soc_1543467,socialskills,reddit_comment,153,"Not strictly true. It only takes a split second for someone to judge you/make an unconscious bias about you. 

Quite simply, people can look at what you’re doing and immediately make a decision that they don’t like you - that by definition is judging someone. Yes, people aren’t likely to sit and ponder your every move, but they don’t need to sit and ponder to form an opinion about you.

I don’t think it’s right to tell people that nobody is thinking about you, but rather say that people do think about what you’re doing and that’s fine. The 20-60-20 rule states that 20% of people that you meet will immediately click with you, 60% of people *may* one day get along with you, the last 20% you’ll never get along with. Deliberately being blind to other people’s judgements won’t help you get more out of that 60%

As far as your friends go, I can’t comment on if they’re good friends or bad just from this one scenario, that’s something that only you can decide, but I do recommend talking with them and establishing boundaries.

My biggest advice to connecting with women is to ask meaningful questions and listen 3X longer than you might think to. Don’t talk to them with an agenda, just start being curious about whoever you meet regardless of their demographics/appearance. Make eye contact and open up your body language. Lean in to small moments of conversation waiting on the bus, ordering coffee, at the grocery store. Don’t be upset if ppl don’t want to talk or open up to you either, this can also show entitlement.

You're fawning, but something is making you direct failed attempts (or even any attempts, as you're frustrated with the sense of even needing to do this) inwardly, as negative thought and self-hatred. *I know how you feel.* ***I know, exactly, how you feel.*** 

&gt;I still want to be nice but I want to be able to say “No.”

Baby these things are not mutually exclusive. *You can be nice and still consider your needs before others.* Love, you're important. Try a thing: you know your best friend? Someone you could never hurt, like they accept you for everything you are? Ask them to ask you things. *Tell them no*. Telling people no *takes practice*. Establishing boundaries is not a thing you just ""do"" overnight. It takes *work*, it takes *practice* to identify when you *WANT* to say no, but say yes anyway, and practice *not doing it*. This is a skill I'm working on *right beside you*. I've *always* done it. Accepting invites to do things when I had other things planned, or when I don't have the ""spoons""/energy/time. Apologizing for *everything* in an attempt to lessen my perceived *punishment* for not doing so in the form of social rejection. My dude, my dog. *You can't please everyone.* Love, don't even try. Friends are going to understand. Just be real with them ""hey I don't have the spoons today to hang"". ""Aight np"". You're not going to nuke, in a 300,000 degree apocalypse, your friendships over the word ""No.""

&gt;but I fucking hate myself I’ll always fucking hate myself.

I want to hug the shit out of you. I know this feeling all too well, and I know the *crushing* weight of what it feels like to live every day under it. To feel like a *snake*, hated and feared, misunderstood. I'm not going to tell you to just magically like, or love yourself (r/thanksimcured). I'm *going* to say that there's a *reason* you feel like this, and I'm gonna venture a wild guess that something, some emotional experience *forged* your thoughts into.. this. *Listen to me and listen good*: ***It's not your fault. It was never your fault.*** 

You're worth your autonomy and boundaries. You can't please everyone, but the people who make an effort to be in your life, and the ones you make an effort toward, they *love you.* I love you. Because I know where you're at. DM me if you don't want to go buck-ass with comments in this thread."
soc_21355,socialskills,reddit_comment,262,"I think the best advice I ever received and also the best advice I have seen I this sub is to **""Fake it till you make it.""** Confidence is formed by 3 things in my personal opinion:

1. The Smile
2. The Clothes
3. The Swagger

First learn to smile. **Practice by smiling everywhere you go.** Start with simple objectives, like 'I will smile till I leave this store' or 'I will smile on my entire commute to work.' This will help you not only seem friendlier to those around you but will actually alter your brain chemistry and make you happier overall.

Second recongnize that **if you want to be treated seriously then you must dress appropriately.** I personally feel more confident in what is considered Business Casual clothing than other clothing, but everyone is different. Find a style that makes you feel like you will be respected. That will help cement your ability to exude confidence because you will be treated better.

Third **master some good body language** aka Swagger. Swagger doesn't mean act like a dick or start walking like a drunk John Wayne, it means learn to apply good body language cues to everything from your walk to your dictation style. You'd be surprised how often enunciation and pronunciation can change the meaning of a sentence. If you add to that strong body language, you'll be golden.

I personally choose to act the way I think **Bruce Wayne** is supposed to act. Social. Smiling. Laughing. Never too serious, always a smirk.

I am not the best looking guy in the world, but I have the MOST BEAUTIFUL wife.  I live a great life. I don’t sweat the small things, tomorrow will be a different day, and all of it depends on how YOU decide to take it on. You can think and worry about how this group of girls think you’re ugly, or decide how you’re going to treat each day that life is beautiful, and be positive."
soc_182234,socialskills,reddit_comment,554,"Something to consider: What's going on within you? And by that, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with you, I'm wondering how in touch with your own emotional states and moods you are.

What I've found, from my own experience and dealing with both close friends and acquaintances, is that emotional intelligence is crucical to authentic relationships. And EI doesn't mean ""5 ways to be happier tomorrow.""

Rather, what I'm talking about is knowing how to understand and interpret what's going on inside of you, and how to manage it. That gives you a place to actually hone in on others' emotions, and be able to forge meaningful connections there. 

Two things I'd recommend:

1. (The easier part) Take some time to see what's going on with you, where your own emotions are at. Mindfulness meditation can help with this, by training you to clear your mind and non-judgmentally observe what passes through it. Journaling can help too--set a timer for 10-15 minutes, and just start writing. Doesn't matter what you write about. Oftentimes, you'll notice things come out that you almost don't consciously have access to (our brains are funny like that, neurologically speaking). 

2. (The harder part) Pick one friend who you'd like to get closer to, maybe one of those superficial relationships you've mentioned. Invite them to a shared activity (tends to be easy if you're a guy in college... Go see an action movie, come over for some FIFA/Super Smash Bros/Call of Duty/whatever, grab a drink at the local bar). Get emotional over something smallish (Don't lie! People can sense when you're not being honest), something you're 100% comfortable disclosing to this person.

""My girlfriend was really stressing me out the other night."" (Could be right or wrong, depending on the person. They could bug out about being single, not care, or sympathize because their own GF nags as well)

""I'm super stressed out about this test that's coming up."" (Probably won't get very far with this one, just because of how low-stakes this tends to be emotionally)

""I wish I knew what to do with my life after college."" (Usually right on the money, with my college friends. They don't really know what's going on, either, so the sympathy is very real, and usually that gives you some common ground to tease out what's hiding behind their walls/masks, and to authentically relate to that.)

""I'm changing my gender, and I want you to start calling me Amanda from now on."" (Probably a little heavy to start building an authentic friendship on)

See how they respond. Because, honestly OP, the problem isn't always with you--sometimes people don't actually want/aren't ready to form meaningful connections with others. But if they respond favorably, with some kind of emotional sympathy or empathy, follow that breadcrumb trail, and start raising the emotional ante, bit by bit. See where the breadcrumb trail leads you with them--might be they open up to you, maybe you eventually hit a wall, but you'll never know if you don't try.

Sorry if this was vague and too brief, I'm in the middle of a lunch break and typing this on my tablet real quick. PM me if you need me to clear anything up, or want to hear more.

Best of luck!

soc_1061859,socialskills,reddit_comment,134,"Lol there’s no specific way a 24 year should act, you’re being to hard on yourself which i can see where your coming from its hard to look past what you didn’t do or risk but you have to accept what situation you are in right now to change it, which is honestly the hardest part of change from my experience. Let me just get this out the way, you’re going to be awkward at first and for awhile even, you might miserably embarrass yourself trying to make friends but if you stay as you are I believe that will be far worse than any embarrassment because you’re obviously not enjoying being alone and it will eat at you relentlessly if it hasn’t already, its all up to you man you got this 👍."
soc_38162,socialskills,reddit_comment,172,"&gt; What I want to know is, what do you talk about with your closest friends?

My innermost thoughts, dreams, desires, and fears.

Try this: ask someone how they are doing. Let them answer with ""fine"". Then say, ""no, how are you *really* doing."" Chances are, there is something that is bothering them, or is otherwise on their mind. They aren't going to tell this to most people, because they think it is just a bother. But if you make it clear, no, you really want to know what is going on with someone, then they are free to open up to you in a very different manner than you can with a stranger or acquaintance. 

Also try this: if someone is telling you about something personal or that they are passionate about, wait until they are done talking. Then say: ""and?"". Watch as they feel free to open up even more.

The long and short of it is: listen a lot. This is the first step of good, deep, meaningful conversation."
soc_950567,socialskills,reddit_comment,110,"Who cares. Whenever this subject comes up, everyone here just assumes that the other person is convoluting a deep hatred towards you. No, that’s probably not the case. Shrug it off because it’s most likely not a question that anyone really gets often, and if it is then a better question is why? Instead of looking for mic drop responses here.

I think this thread follows that trend and hurts more social skills than it helps. Just my opinion I guess"
soc_235430,socialskills,reddit_comment,135,"I know there is a lot of Facebook hate here on reddit, but I think these sites are what you make of them, and can be useful when building a social life. It depends on how you utilise them. 

I'm also in my late 20s, and for a period of my early 20s, I stopped using social media for about 4 years. When I was off Facebook, I'd collect phone numbers, and found I had to use whatsapp *constantly*, to remind people to invite me to the next big event. Otherwise, I'd miss out on group events that were organised exclusively on Facebook. 

Other than this, it had no detrimental effect on my social life, other than occasionally feeling out-of-the-loop when people would say 'Hey, did you see on Facebook? So-and-so is engaged/married/had a kid.' "
soc_47500,socialskills,reddit_comment,218,"It IS a valid question.

People who downvoted you can think of it this way. Let's say you are a social butterfly and you have thousands of friends and you are well liked. You go out and eat on your own. You would not care what others think. You don't have to explain anything to anyone. You don't need to prove anything to anyone. You are happy. If people thought that you were a sad loner, then it's simply not true and you would not give a fuck.

If you are ripped and people call you fat, you just don't give a fuck because they are wrong. If you are loaded and you go out looking scruffy you don't give a fuck if others think that you are poor. Only truth hurts. So the only way you would feel uncomfortable or have to justify your decision to go eat on your own is if you actually have nobody to go for a meal with or you felt lonely.

Happy people with abundance in life don't even give these things a second thought. They just go and do things. They won't even remember it the next day. Let alone feel the need to go and tell the world about it.

So it's a very valid question. Ignore the ignorant."
soc_1821886,socialskills,reddit_comment,357,"I would say confidence. 

&amp;#x200B;

My family and peers have bullied me a lot throughout my life. Growing older and having to deal with it for 18 long years I have learned the best method. Confidence, I know that sounds cheesy however, you are the one who only knows what truly went through your head while they were making you feel like shit. You have to realize they do not understand you, respect you, or see you for who you are. They don't care how you feel about the situation they just want to have a silly game and that is not okay. 

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of defending yourself understand what truly went down. When bullying happens I realize I tend to believe the bully's perspective more than my own although I was there. When you can ignore them, know yourself, and be okay with fact that they will not respect you it is how you will rise within yourself and in the world. Why would they bully someone who won't care? The whole point of bullying is to make you feel weak, to build themselves, and to feel better about a situation they were wrong in.  When you don't feed their egos it will help you move on and understand that they have no idea what they are talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

coming from a people pleaser and a sensitive person I have realized pride and confidence is the best route to these kind of things. Know that you are a good person, you are trying your best, and look in the mirror and tell yourself that you're proud of yourself. It is hard to deal with bullying especially when it comes to passive aggressive. You recognize it is not okay and props to you. Now it is your choice if you want to feed into their unnecessary drama and hatred or if you want to be happy. There is nothing wrong with you so do not believe what they say. People's actions do not define the person you are.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this helps. Remember you are strong and worthy of a good life.

best of wishes"
soc_324591,socialskills,reddit_comment,154,"Hi I can relate to you and can help I think.  What do you think of just being easygoing and in the moment?  It's up to you.  You don't have to play stupid games or do anything you don't want to.  I wouldn't talk about towels for 20 minutes unless it was a serious crush haha.  So you know, feigning interest for the art of conversation isn't too much of a sin in my eyes - just keep it 100!.  

As far as the coming out of the depression thing, I can relate to that too.  Just do things for yourself or better yet do good things for others.  Youll feel better trust me.  Taking the high road in life, whatever that means, is always an attractive option and you'll bring people in with your positivity and wonderfulness.  Just dont let that go to your head.  I like to have fun with my karma!"
soc_6885,socialskills,reddit_comment,363,"It depends on the person you are going with, having said that, here is some stuff that comes to mind:

**Do**

**1. Smell nice.** 

**2. Listen well.** Learn about her.

**3. Be natural with compliment timing and delivery.** If you don't mean it, don't say it, if you do mean it, say it like you mean it.

**4. Observe.** When you watch people interact with their surroundings, you learn a lot. If she is into dancing, by all means dance, even if you feel silly or embarrassed, don't take it all too seriously and have fun.

**5. Be confident** How? Be yourself. 

**6. Apply the appropriate amount of chivalry.** Some girls love a guy who holds the door, some despise. Gauge this and respond accordingly.

**7. Enjoy her company.**  Have fun. Laugh. Make eye contact. She'll like you liking her.

**8. Take a risk.** Be brave. If you feel scared or nervous, it's an opportunity to overcome it and slay the dragon of intimidation. Do something unique in that you follow your heart, which is sadly a rare occurrence.

**DON'T**

**1. Be gross.** 

**2. Make her feel uncomfortable.** 

**3. Look at other girls.** some guys have a major problem with this. I don't get it.

**4. Worry about what she's thinking.** 

**5. Forget to check your swag.** Guys have to go to the bathroom and check themselves out to make sure they are still looking fresh and clean, too.



**6. Be afraid to touch her.** Starts with a light back hand touch to her shoulder then turns into a small rub of the shoulder. You have to flirt with her and part of that is physical contact, basically. So it starts small and escalates from there. If she isn't receptive or is the type of person who doesn't like to be touched, ease up and just stay friendly.

**7. Leave too late.** Always leave her wanting more. This goes for anything. Time to wrap it up during the falling action, not the denouement.

  
I would also prepare a [mind script](http://colorgenicstest.com/Goldin-Girl-Column/how-using-a-mind-script-will-make-your-life-better.html) for yourself so that you don't give off nervous vibes at certain times.

Good luck, man.

soc_744420,socialskills,reddit_comment,387,"It seems like you are around pretty cool and social people. I would just learn directly from them. Advice on Reddit is just substitute for the real thing: learning IRL. Watch how they interact, how they tell stories, and basically just try to do that. After you hang out around social people long enough, you'll just naturally pick up on social etiquette. 

It is normal that 2/6 asked you something or mentioned something about you. It is up to you to present yourself in conversation, others are not responsible in making sure you are spoken to and about. That would be nice of course, but is extra and I personally would never expect it. Whenever I am in a group talking I always correctly assume that if I am not present and do not insert myself, I will just be left alone and when someone does talk to me it will be to ask me why I am so quiet. If the group is large enough they may just forget you're there. They aren't ignoring you or trying to show you that you don't belong. Rather, they are just so present in the moment and engaged in the conversation they don't have time to also worry about you. And rightfully so. It would be rude if I was talking to someone and the whole time they were focused on someone that wasn't even speaking.

You should talk to your crush whenever you want. No reason why you should have to wait that long. 

You're happier and want to be a better person because humans crave social interactions the same way they crave food and water. We just can't die from isolation so some of us don't tend to our social health as much as we should. BUT I just want to say that you being happy and wanting to be a better person is an INTRINSIC GOAL meaning it is a goal YOU set for YOURSELF and the results and progress you make are from WITHIN. Yeah sure this came about as a result of EXTERNAL factors, but realize that your destiny and happiness are in YOUR hands and regardless if these people continue to be around or if ANYONE continues to be around or not, you are more than capable of self improvement on your own."
soc_1465533,socialskills,reddit_comment,154,"Females tend to be taught that their worth is directly correlated with their appearance and by how much men want these females to service men's sexual needs.

It also makes them believe that the worst possible insult, the thing that will break someone and ensure they are never competition again, is, you guessed it, calling them ugly. It's tough, but we all have to find ways to make our self-worth come from within. The self is stable, the self can be a loving home that will bring you through all kinds of storms.

If they repeatedly give you excuses for pre-arranged things, then I question THEIR commitment to this friendship. You can't have a friendship that's only held up on your end. 

You don't have to drop them as a friend, but how about bouncing the ball into their court? Tell them they can be the one to set up the plans for next time. Then it's up to YOU to show up. Now if they flake on their OWN thing that they've set up, again, I'd question the status of the friendship.

An interesting comment from a youtube user:

""I suffered from hypervigelence/excessive worrying for most of my life. Last year, my anxiety reached a record high that almost threw me over the edge. That's when I decided that enough was enough. I made it my life-mission to beat anxiety. I started going to a therapist, and practiced, practiced and practiced mindfulness: constantly being aware of the thoughts that go through my head, and managing to shut down irrationally negative thoughts. It's been a long process to retrain my brain to not worry, but now, a year and two months later, I'm finally starting to reap the rewards. Anxiety is a thing of the past for me. I would still feel anxious if I'm presented with a frightening reality, like realizing that my phone has been stolen, that I lost the keys to the apartment, if someone physically attacked me etc...but I do not worry about the past or the future. I have chosen not to feel sorry for myself for the dreadful things that befell me in the past. My tragedies do not define me, and the future is no longer frightening because it doesn't exist. I had joined many Facebook groups for anxious people, and I'm still a member. I try to help people with this new knowledge of mine, but strangely enough, they don't listen. They are somehow happy feeling consumed by the pity they feel for themselves and they demand others to pity them. They do not believe that they can be cured. If you are anxious, know that I feel no pity for you. You, and you alone, have the power to leave this anxious life style behind. But you need to want it badly enough. Make your choice, are you ready to be strong?﻿:"""

You could almost reach out and touch the firefly.  That's how close the firefly is.  The restaurant table is real.  The firefly is real.  Do you believe you will pay taxes next year?

That table will feel the weight of your arm as it slides across its surface.  Your palm will be up, beckoning to the beautiful woman across.  This moment does exist, but it won't hurry itself for you.  You must wait for the firely to firefly its way towards you.  You can't rush firefly.  Instinctively the woman will place her hand over yours.  You will envelope your fingers around the body of her hand.  You will gaze into her eyes.

You Will drive that nice car, and you Will live in that nice house.  Her eyes will be the only thing you see.  You will hold her hand, and you will hold her gaze, and she will regale you with the tale of her rape.  The moment will grab you.  You will gaze into her eyes For her, on Her whim.  She will look elsewhere often, and long.  Your focus will remain.  There will be no other Thing in the room.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Only her eyes, and her story.  Through all the saga, through all the ups and downs, you will experience mute.  You will learn the deception of man.  You will be impotent.  The retelling will last several minutes.  You will eventually, reluctantly lower your eyes to discover bountiful plates of food between you.  Cold.  Remember the before times?  You will decline the cardboard box.  The cold food is real.  The warm people are real.  The ones seated shoulders away from you, lost in their own conversations.  Your waitress is in your future.  Do you see your future self?  Is he a nice person?  Do people generally not hate this future guy?

And most think they're qualified for a super hot guy, even if they aren't close. Big egos on tinder. Humbly, I'm in the top tier of men according to what I've been told, and through success with women over the years in general. Tinder is only good for the top 5% of men that capture the attention of most of the women on there.  The best way to find women is to leave your ego at the door and play the numbers game in real life without giving a single fuck of being turned down. Always charming and nice and fun, never afraid. Go talk to girls with no real intentions other than meeting, telling them they look cute (not always necessary), and asking for their snapchat or phone number if they seem cool enough to go further. Self worth is important here as far as how you will come across.  Do they seem cool to YOU? Are they worthy of YOU asking for their snapchat or number? Is YOUR good vibe meter going off? A lot of guys don't have this mindset. They're stuck on how they can be perfect for this stranger, so that they wont be denied.

p.s. Girls want to be in a love story, so some of the best times to meet women are the times that you aren't seeking it. The times when you just so happen to be stuck on a train and there's a beautiful woman there who just spilled her coffee all over the floor. You help her, get a new coffee, think on your feet, and boom, its a love story.  There will be opportunities, it up to you to be the man.

Some advice would be to think of the things you'd want them to do for you (e.g., invite you out to lunch, ask your opinion on something, etc.), and then do that for them. Being social in a business environment is the same as being likable. 

Give a compliment to someone. Ask them if they saw the game last night. See if they want to go out to lunch with you. Buy them each a ""Happy Holidays"" card. Ask if they had a good weekend. Bring doughnuts in one day. 

All of those things, among many others, will help establish you as someone who is likable. The people in your office won't change overnight, but they'll definitely start to warm up to you. "

No they aren't? Like, you clearly grew up in an environment where that was your norm, but it definitely isn't *the* norm. 

I'm not powerful and I'm definitely not rich, and I can tell you that power dynamics exist everywhere, not exclusively for the rich and powerful. And it's totally normal, when in an environment where there is a distinct social hierarchy, to be afraid of disrupting it. No one wants to be on the bottom of the social ladder, and so people do things like kiss up to whoever the perceive to be ""on top"" and avoid making any mistakes that might make you fall to the bottom. 

Networking is good for a lot of things, especially if you're in an industry that is focused a lot on how other people perceive you, which honestly tends to be most industries (whether they want to accept it or not). Networking helps get your foot in the door, but it's up to you to push it open. "

You have a problem, you can either see yourself for who you are and what's going on, or you can remain in denial. It's your choice. But leave this person alone. They're not interested and that's not their problem."
soc_146660,socialskills,reddit_comment,153,"Talking to her is a good idea: it's the only way that you can hear what she thinks.  I'm wondering if confronting her is a great way to do it, or if you might be able to use nonviolent communication techniques to get her to open up to you?

I am not overly comfortable with what I'm hearing about how she treats you, so I think getting it cleared up would be a good idea.  So, if you can't get her to tell you what's up, I agree with those who are suggesting you move on and socialize with other people.

All of that said, be prepared to hear that she thinks you started being cold first.  When something like this has been going on for a while, it can be hard to agree on how it started, and the most constructive option might be to just focus on how to fix it."
soc_161369,socialskills,reddit_comment,149,"Think about it from his perspective. How would you feel if someone you knew and vibed well with just randomly popped up to you and asked you about something you have in common or that you love?

Personally I'd feel great about it. Someone taking their time to talk to me directly. It shows me that they are interested in me and want to either become closer friends or start dating. Most people are afraid of giving this signal but the one on the receiving end will always see it in a positive light and be flattered at the very least. Go for it :)

I'd probably say to talk to him a bit and see if you can organise something so you guys can actually talk face to face. Facebook is great but meeting up is the best way to get to know someone well

Good luck ;)

soc_96355,socialskills,reddit_comment,596,"Like everyone said, the age gap is negligible. I also come from a military background, entering college at 24.

IMO college is one of the last environments that provides daily opportunities that encourage social interaction. Although it can seem like there is social pressure, remember that the population of the school means you can be as memorable or unmemorable as YOU want.  There are 25k people all carving out their individual lives. No, they don't all hate you. No, they aren't ignoring you. 

I'm not sure what you want. Do you want to be more social? Do you want more friends? Or do you want general social tips? In general, everyone is doing their own thing. Its entirely up to you on being social, and conversely nonsocial. 

The best thing about college social interactions is there are MANY default conversation starters at your disposal. For example: ""Man, totally don't feel like being here today."" ""Did you do the homework?"" ""How do you feel about this test?"" ""Do you mind comparing homework."" ""I couldn't figure out number X, do you mind explaining it to me."" ""Hi, my name is X. I'm having a lot of problems in here. You want to join a study group I'm helping organize?""

The possibilities interacting before and after class are literally endless. You share one thing automatically with every student, that you are in college. Its like going on a date. You can be friendly asking simple, normal questions. What is your major? What job would you like after college? What do you do for fun? Hell, make it a point to introduce yourself to your neighbor in class, every time. You'll start running into people in other classes you share. You'll run into them at the coffee shop or grocery store. Who knows, you may have similar majors and the friendship can be mutually beneficial as you help each other in diff classes. After your first year, you'll start to recognize the same faces. These people are probably in your major, and most likely your graduating class. Befriending the more responsible students among them can be invaluable. I try to make a friend in every class. Even if its not to hang out, i may miss a day and ask them to send a pic of their notes. Most people are more than willing to exchange numbers because it always helps to have a friend to help on coursework.

Join a club. There are tons and tons of different clubs. Ethnic groups (like asian student association). Societies for your major (like society of mechanical engineers). Fraternities. These are literally clubs for people of similar interests/backgrounds to hang out among peers that have similar interests. People go to the events EXPECTING to meet new people. Exchange numbers. Suggest meeting up to hang out. The easiest way to hang out with a girl is to ask if she wants to study. I mean the opportunities are there, you just have to recognize them. 

And finally, if you find certain people are turned off or don't want to hang out, or a girl rejects you, or they don't want to be your friend, Don't sweat it. Seriously, who gives a fuck. There will be 24,999 other students that may be interested. At least 10,000 other girls. Literally. Think about that.  They dont spend their free time thinking about how much they hate you, so don't waste your time worrying about it. Go to class, make friends, hang out, have fun, have sex, take risks. Live, laugh, and love. Then have some more sex. "

- make sure she sees you with another woman (or man - if that’s your preference) looking friendly/ affectionate. Still can nod hello etc then as she will likely think your taken. 

- stop nodding and smiling at her - or at least at a reduced frequency. I would not stop all together unless you get stalker/harasser vibes personally as sometimes all someone has to look forward to is a smile from someone (just my perspective).

soc_910305,socialskills,reddit_comment,258,"Cheers. And I'm not saying don't have a casual fling if the opportunity presents itself and that's what you want, but also don't feel pressure to settle if you'd rather hold out for something better. There's no formula that says you must hook up by X age or sleep with Y number of partners. These things vary a LOT (and don't assume that other people talking about their ""numbers"" are being honest either), so do what feels right for you. I'll tell you my first time was lame as shit. I thought it was just something I needed to get over with because of my age, and it sucked. Loads of people end up feeling that way. I don't beat myself up about it, but I'm not proud of it either. Know what I mean? There's no right or wrong way for all of this to go down. Your first relationship might be phenomenal, and it might be a total dud. And either way, that's life. You'll be just fine. It's hard at your age, but try not to build it up in your head. There will be a first time, and there will be times after that. It will happen in its own course. It (probably) won't be the earth-shattering event you thought it would be, and that's okay. That's why I say keep working on yourself. Take care of yourself, and maintain other interests.

soc_192285,socialskills,reddit_comment,557,"&gt; Are you sure that's possible? 

Not *always* always, but mostly. It's a question of framing. 

* one variant is simply framing your message as doubt rather than as contradiction. It's the difference between ""Do you have a source for that? I've read that actually,..."" and ""Wrong. In fact,..."" Whether you see that as being disingenious or rephrasing is up to you, obviously.

* another one is the general expectation towards you. I'm known to be honest and direct (IRL that is). That's why honest criticism is expected from me and friends ask me for advice rather frequently. Now, if someone wants to have their ego stroked or their feelings spared, they know not to ask me. I'm still too 'confrontational' for some people, but those are the ones who don't share my values at all - people getting to know me learn quickly that I certainly don't avoid conflict where it is healthy and useful to progress. I'd wager that to strangers, you come across as seeking intellectual conflict where it is not needed. That was the case for me.

&gt;  Is our conclusion that people just don't want to learn?

Some do, others don't. Most people are probably not interested in your kind of learning. Not every wants to learn what you can teach, just like you don't want to learn what everyone can teach you. Finding those who you're compatible with in that regard is probably one of the most important things in life. 

It's also a question of learning styles. Yours is probably more dry than others', which results in an equally dry tone of presentation. The best teachers I ever had were ones who knew how to project their own enthusiasm and interest onto others. If you're able to do that or guess their motivations and ideals and present your cause as referring to those, you make it far easier for them to accept your position.

&gt; What I don't understand is when someone shows an interest in a topic, but can not continue the topic unless I basically accept to either remain silent or agree with something I know isn't true.

As stupid as it may sound, stubborn people are stubborn. It's not your task to get along with everyone - actually, you can choose not to interact with others on a general basis. What is practical, however, is optimising your style so you are both comfortable and able to communicate with a majority of the people around you.

I like to say that I get along with everyone - it's not entirely true. I can get along with everyone who is interested in any kind of relationship on eye-level. For example, I generally don't get along with people who *must* dominate a group regardless of who is most qualified or proficient or those who require constant praise. Adapting to their standards would contradict my personal values, so I'm perfectly fine not interacting with people. And that's fine, because they make maybe 5% of the population - and certainly not the healthiest 5%.

First off, during your conversation with her leading up to you two going out tonight, this was planned out to be a date.  For her to bring a friend along is completely out of line.  Even if the friend was cool, it was an absolute shit move.  And that was before they ditched you.  

A lot of people talk about being led on yadda yadda yadda and usually it's a case of entitlement or nice guy syndrome but situations like this...where you planned a date with this woman and this is how it played out, she definitely led you on and then played you, it's severely fucked up.  This was cruel and unjust.  If she didn't want to go on the date she could have politely declined and not showed up at all and blocked you before wasting your time.

Is conversing the issue? Break it down to an algorithm. There's 4 things that people are always thinking about subconsciously: money, social relationships, fitness, dreams. Figure out the context of your situation and ask about those 4 things. For example, if you meet them in class, you may want to ask what their major is then what their end goal is. If they say something like, it's to travel around the world seeing beautiful sights and playing guitar, you pick two of the three topics to relate to and share your experience. You can talk either about your love of traveling, the beautiful sights you've seen or instruments you play. If u keep picking 2 topics to chain off of, it'll flow. It helps if you're genuinely interested in the person and can naturally ask questions.

I'm not trying to be dismissive of your situation. I know everyone is different and sometimes it'll feel hopeless, but life is much about serendipity. It's not natural for many people, but if you work at it, you'll be better off than most. keep your eyes out and ull get oppertunties. Don't focus on not being a virgin.

1. Being a virgin means you’re a low std risk - a definite plus for a lot of women.

3. It sounds like “working your ass off” means only improving your physical self to you, which is like, the easiest/most enjoyable thing to do unless you have a disability. 
4. It sounds like your friends are jerks, and women have agency (surprise!) and can see that.
5. Is it all women you strike out with, or just the ones you think are “10’s”, and do you treat the others like they don’t exist? Making someone feel genuinely important is like 90% of having “game”."

For me, I realized that fear was holding me back from engaging in new hobbies/activities, and the same thing for talking with new people. Eventually I had to resolve that I wasn’t going to let fear run my life, and I adopted a mindset to start trying things I’m afraid of. Run towards the fear. Be the master of your own destiny. Maybe this approach would help you. 

You mentioned that you don’t have hobbies. I think this is the first place to start- find something you enjoy doing! Start trying things, you never know what might pique your interest. I would suggest dancing classes. They’re usually free or very cheap (~$10) and tons of people go there just to meet others. And even if people come as a group, dancing is a very social activity so they would welcome you in! Pick a dance of your choice and just go for it!"

I would say in that case you are very afraid of people it seems. But that's just my opinion.

soc_215682,socialskills,reddit_comment,364,"Hey, I'm in the same boat. I still have an old-school Nokia simply because I can't afford a smartphone, and I chose to delete my social media accounts a couple years ago because of the negative effect it had on my mental health. Deleting facebook - like you said - really improved how I spend my free time. I feel less preoccupied with what others are doing and what they think of me. Good for you for making that choice! 

Yeah, there are lots of young people who use facebook as a crutch for their social lives. I definitely went through the same thing when I ditched it - suddenly a lot of people, including people I considered real friends, nearly forgot I existed. Exclusion is definitely a cost when you decide to remove yourself from social media. What I had to do was make an effort to initiate conversation more, find other ways to talk to people (e.g. Steam, Skype), and invite friends to hang out more. I think that the people who actually cared about my presence were able to adapt after a while. 

Even after two years, I still feel the sting occasionally of not being in on a joke or a story because it's told through facebook or snapchat... but finding a simpler platform for communication has helped quite a lot. Since many of my friends like PC gaming, talking to them more on Steam has been a great way to keep them in touch. 

I've also gradually learned to make friends by involving myself in more activities like volunteering that require a physical presence and teamwork. I've even invited friends to volunteer with me. Once in a great while, someone accepts, and it's really fun! You can also try meetup.com to look for groups/clubs with similar interests and even invite a friend along if you like. Just a couple ideas. 

I really respect your choice to keep yourself in the real world. Don't feel pressured to go back to social media, but also don't be afraid to join in somewhere if you feel that it will benefit your social life. You'll gradually find a balance that works for you."

My best advice is to get a clear picture of where you want to be.  It sounds like your social skills were below average, and they have improved but you still feel like you're a little behind.  I feel that way about myself.  What has helped me is to get a better understanding of what ""average"" or ""normal"" really is.  Everyone is insecure.  The beautiful people want to be smarter, the smart people want to be beautiful, the people from broken families want to be loved, the people with big, supportive families want privacy and space.  The sad truth is that even when your confidence level reaches the point where it would have been had you never been bullied, you'll still have some insecurities, lonely times, and weekends at home by yourself.  This is what I would do, take it or leave it.  Consider the possibility that your journey to social normalcy is over.  Consider that maybe you have arrived, and you are just like everyone else.  Internalize that, then make an honest evaluation of yourself, and establish new goals for yourself.  A new direction.  A new perspective on how to feel more socially and romantically fulfilled.

So what to do?

A (you): hey your necklace is so dope, where'd u get it?
B(anyone): thanks! i got it from ____
A: ohh nice i think ive heard of the brand/store, are u pretty deep into fashion?
B: nah not rlly i just thought it looked cool/yeah! i love making hard fits
A: oh i see, then what sort of stuff do you normally do for fun?/that's dope! what other things do u normally do for fun?

you get the idea. compliments can help set up an 'in' for a conversation AND they make the other person feel great

also people generally seem to care significantly less abt what u say and more abt how u make them feel, such as.... giving them a compliment! even if u say smth stupid just roll w it as confidently as u can fake it. just my two cents

o also silence when hanging out w someone isnt a bad thing and it's not an awkward silence as long as u show with open body language that ur just chillin and not anxiously thinking of the next thing to say (even if u are)"
soc_785797,socialskills,reddit_comment,440,"I honestly don't understand it. It goes against everything I thought I understood. If someone were to be hard to get replies from (texting context), it gains value over messages that come easily. However, conversely, one would think getting so few messages implies a lack of interest in you. Objectively, that is how it appears.

Of course, there are any number of reasons for slow replies, or lazy-looking replies (those kill me). But I will say this, yes, I see how getting few responses increases the value of each much the same as hearing ""I love you"" from someone that never says it would be significant. But, just the same, if someone never told you they love you, you could assume they don't really care all that much. Yes, those are totally different things that I don't think quite compare well, but hopefully you get the idea.

I personally fall into the category where if I get messages often, it tells me that I am valued. For someone to make time to chat with me, well of course, it must mean that I am important to them and they WANT to chat with me. And no, it does not take much time. Yes, people get busy, and I realize that. It does sound needy, but everyone wants to be valued. And if they are taking the time to message you often, it may decrease the value of each message, but it shows how much THEY value YOU, and of course, it works both ways.

When you don't have the time, tell them so in a way that still conveys that you DO want to chat, but can't. Getting a response four hours later still sucks, no matter how you slice it if you have no idea what's going on. Best balance is to know the person well and what they prefer. For example, my best friend rarely reaches out and does not like long, (my forte) or excessive messaging. So I have do dial back with her, but I almost get nothing even though I know she cares. Really not fair. I've tried telling her, but hey... You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. Different strokes at the end of the day... Everyone is different. 

Edit: Also, everyone's definition of ""often"" is different. For me, getting a single initial message a day or every couple days is nice. Keep in touch! I like to do the same. Also, being able to have a real text **conversation** instead of every response being hugely delayed is nice. Otherwise, it seems forced. ""Ugh, I guess I'll reply."""

soc_666937,socialskills,reddit_comment,568,"This can be really upsetting. I am really sorry that you are going through this. I have experienced the same thing and honestly it is the shittiest feeling ever. 

Confronting them, that's one way you can approach this but they may not take it lightly and turn it against you. But hey, you never know how they will react and it's how they respond to your confrontation determines if they will be a good or bad influence in your life.

I get it. You have free time, you wanted to relax and chill with friends. It's only right to feel betrayed when they decide to hang out with someone else after you made the absolute effort to make plans with them. 

Take it into perspective of how the other person would feel if they went with you instead and left the person who doesn't like you anymore alone. They would probably feel the same way talking about how they valued your opinion more than theirs. I'm not saying what your friends did was right, but it might have been difficult for your friends to make the choice as to who to go with. But judging how they reacted when you wanted to make plans with them only to hang out with your other friend, that's pretty fucking low of them. You probably (I'm assuming) spent more quality time with them than your other friend, so it's only right to take the opportunity to hang out with you or at least include you in whatever activity they have.

I have to say, you can cry if you want it, let the feelings go out, but please do not be petty. It will only ruin your character and loving personality. If that's how your friends want to treat you after getting close with one another, shrug it off (I know that's really hard, but stay with me) and go out with other people. Show that you will have a better time with people who enjoy your company rather than use you for attention. Make it look like they made the mistake of their lives picking that person over you and treating you like that after you made the effort to hang out with them. If they come back to you and want to make plans, treat them the same way they did to you (I know this contradicts the whole ""Don't be petty"" thing), but honestly they deserve it. And if they blow you off because you're treating them the same way they did to you, just leave them honestly, you don't need that toxicity, you're better off with other people.

The other route would be to just play it off and see how your friendships progress from there. Do their plans not involve you as much anymore? Do they talk to you differently? Only time will tell bud, that's all I can tell you. It's up to you whether or not you want to cut the cord with them or talk to them about it so you can get past this depressing time and grow stronger together. I would prefer that you try the latter first because this just seems like a minor setback and it would be too over-dramatic to just shun them out of your lives over this. Just let them know how you feel and see how they react, and judge from there.

Best of Luck!"

I’ll get over this. this too shall pass’, ‘no one really, truly thinks about me in that way. it was just an irrational act. maybe they’re going through something’) it’s a method I use to get over things that have really bothered me. Also remind yourself of all your good qualities that you or others have said about you. In addition, I’d say express to your family that those comments sorta hurt. Maybe even ask if all those things are really true about you, and if they really think of you that way (this is totally up to you and your judgement on how they’d react, but it could make them backtrack and remind them that you’re human, and can become self-conscious). Hopefully all these tips help, as someone who experiences over-stressing on bad events a lot."

soc_1612624,socialskills,reddit_comment,177,"I know it feels like you may end up old, alone and unloved, and that may even be a possibility but you are young and you never know what may happen. 

How to make peace with it?
Live your best life. Do we need to be loved? No. Do we need a partner? Also, no. Do we need to be HAPPY? No. Those things are nice to have but so is a billion dollars… Create a life that brings you peace and contentment. Focus on the small, good things and work on either improving or just being indifferent to the negative things. 

For example, the other day I was one second, one wrong move from being likely killed in a car accident. Did I spend any time worrying about how I almost died? No. I thought about how lucky I was and let it go. Cut out the negative people and negative things in your life and find peace in that. 

It will get better. It’s your life and your choice how you feel about living it."
soc_897324,socialskills,reddit_comment,604,"Okay I hope advice from a 20 yr old (normalish I guess) girl. I got into my first relationship about a year ago. I was 20 yr old had never even kissed a guy bc I was so picky. Honestly he was chill yet persistent and that’s how he got me. We have both said how the timing of our relationship worked out great bc we were both battling mental health stuff before and just had some growing to do. He also doesn’t have the greatest social skills lol. He used to be SUPER anxious about talking to me and beat himself up about what he would say but I never would of known unless he told me later. So don’t be so hard on yourself! U gotta stop worrying so much about getting into a relationship bc they come when u least expect it (I would know). Worry about yourself. I think you said your getting a degree that’s awesome! And u workout? U must be driven and a good women will love that. Get out there and meet girls and PRACTICE TALKING TO THEM. It’s all about practice practice practice. How will u ever be ready when a great one comes around? Stop worrying if they r ur soulmate and just make meaningful connections with people. 

Signs she is not interested and u should drop immediately!
-standing u up 
-very rarely replying
-super short replies every time 
-ghosts you ever
Try ur best to try and meet in person. Texting back is easy but meeting up takes work and if she won’t do that then drop. Also if she is doing these things don’t keep pursuing this can come off is creepy. Unfortunately girls will flirt or text bc they are bored. This is usually inconsistent though. So that’s why the in person thing helps. Read her body language. Is she leaning away from you? Are her feet turned away? If so she’s probably not interested soooo drop. Trust your gut. You will get better with practice at gaging if girls are interested.

As far as talking to them. Ask people questions about themselves they love it! Actually listen to their answers people can tell if ur really listening. If it seems fitting, interject with any relative comments or stories. Practice having answers for the questions you ask bc they might ask them in return. Practice having answers to standard questions. When in doubt don’t ramble ( I hate when I do this) And try to not over share unless they seem to really open up as well. 

Everything I’ve said can apply to making friends as well! It’s all about practice! It’s a numbers game really. If u talk to 1 new person the odds are very slim that y’all will click and make great friends. If u talk to 100 new people the odds are one of y’all will click!

Work on / worry about self improvement. Working out is a huge self confidence boost (I know that’s true for me). What else will help? What else are you insecure about? Try a basic skin care routine. Try meditating. Try eating better. Stay on top of your school work. Try new hobbies. Whatever you think. Journaling really helps as well making this stuff clear to you. 

Also don’t leave unless you have your heart set. If u think the grass is greener it’s prob no. I’ve traveled quite a bit to several countries and people r the fucking same everywhere. Same shit different toilet. 

Sorry if this is chaotic or rambley but I just really wanted to help. Good luck!"
soc_636234,socialskills,reddit_comment,399,"It's hard for me to second guess how your friends actually feel about you since I'm not in their heads, but even if they really like you, what use is that if they're making you feel unliked? You don't necessarily have to ditch these friends, but broaden your horizons and find people who will make you feel more valued. Do you have any hobbies/interests, and could you hook up with more like minded people? If you're still at school you'll be at a stage where you're changing quite rapidly and people who you had a lot in common with a few years ago, you won't necessarily now.

They don't sound like complete lost causes - I say they but of course these are 5 separate people. The twins, in particular, if they're 'kind and supportive and have helped you through stuff and generally been very nice', I mean there's something there. Why they are so useless when it comes to making plans with you I really don't know. Are these people all hanging out with each other/other people rather than you or are they just lazy and/or spend more time doing things alone and/or with family?

The guy who stood you up for his dog - I mean, I'd be lying if I said I hadn't baled out on plans at the last minute to spend time with my cat (I still haven't been allowed to live that one down), but they weren't one-on-one plans, it was a group. I think baling last minute on one-on-one plans without a solid reason like illness or death is rude and insulting nearly all the time, but especially when being given such an absurd reason as 'bonding with his dog'. Doesn't he live with his dog? Can't he 'bond' with him anytime I mean it's just ridiculous, it's not even worth deconstructing this excuse. If he doesn't make it up to you he's an ass.

The guy who keeps asking you to draw things and then asking you to change them - I mean that's an odd one. It's cool that he likes your drawings enough to 'commission' them (I use the phrase loosely), but if you're not getting anything in return then tell him where to stick it. He wants drawings from you but he's 'never happy with them' and he's getting them for free? Who does he think he is?!"
soc_103259,socialskills,reddit_comment,342,"Well, I disagree on the drugs part.  There are parts of this world where drugs are legal, there were times where some illegal drugs were legal and legal drugs were illegal, there are some people who use drugs responsibly, there are people with mental illness who self-medicate, there are people who use drugs for fun, and there are people who use drugs to try and understand themselves and this world.  A lot of very respectable people that have contributed to growth in society and culture have used drugs. And drug use is more guided by socioeconomic status and family history than anything. Thievery and smoking pot are not one and the same. You don't have to use drugs. No pressure here, that's your choice and I have complete respect for you not wanting to use or get in any sort of legal trouble, but my experience with that crowd is that there are good and bad people just like in all other walks of life.  But a lot of them are the nicest, most selfless, and interesting people.  This is all besides the point though,  I can tell you have had it rough. Still it sounds like you have some friends and you can make more.  It isn't the end here.  I feel you on the romance part.  I've never been to successful in that field.  I have had relationships but it has been awhile.  It IS hard to deal with, but there really isn't anything you can do, but keep trying.  Invite others to things.  You said you know lots of people.  What is to keep you from hanging out with them.  Give it a try.  You have to have something in common.   Also, there are online communities where you can meet tons of different people.  Some of them might live where you do and be interested in similar things.  Where do you live?  A change of setting and a fresh start in an area with more similar thinking people and concerts that you could attend could be a good move."
soc_383368,socialskills,reddit_comment,528,"You're thinking too hard about it, dude.  Chill out a bit, you've hopefully got about 70 years ahead of you to worry about any one person.

Put yourself first.  It sounds selfish, out of context it kind of is, but unless you're actually in a relationship with somebody, keep yourself on top of the list of important people to worry about.

By craving attention from this one person or persons you're putting them up on a pedestal, which is just as bad and unhealthy for both people as putting someone down can be.  When you raise someone up like that, not only are you setting unrealistic standards that they, a fellow human who is only human, will not be able to maintain in your mindset, but you're degrading yourself at the same time.  Maybe it's not on purpose, but it sounds to me like that's what you're doing.

If you want attention from them, you're going to have to be yourself around them.  If you want to be yourself around them, you need to realize that you guys are equals.  Maybe she's just as worried about what you think about her as you are what she thinks about you.  Or maybe she doesn't really care, who's to say.  It's not healthy to put that much stock into what any one person thinks of you, though.

It may suck to not get attention from this person, but in 30 years are you still going to be worrying about it?  In 30 years, will you still even know each other?  What about 20?  5?  Maybe in just a few months you'll both have moved on to bigger and better things.  Maybe tomorrow she'll say something so incredibly racist that you'll wonder how you ever thought she was attractive in the first place.

I'm not saying to be apathetic to what people think or anything, I'm just saying that nobody's opinion of you should be strong enough to cripple you.  You are a strong, independent woman who don't need no man, as the kids say.

If an attractive girl is giving you attention, or, heck, is even *sleeping* with you, I'm not sure why you're worrying, even subconsciously, about her opinion of you.  In both of those scenarios she's obviously chill with you, at least a little bit.  Unless your true personality is being a giant dick oyster, you shouldn't have any worries about being chill around them too.

I've been in the same place as you're describing all my life, save for the past couple years, and because of what I've laid out I was able to get through it.  If someone's trying to be chill with you, you've got nothing to worry about.  Heck, even if someone's straight up hating on you, you still have nothing to worry about.  You're just a side character in their story, as they are in yours.  This story is about you, so give yourself the attention and love you deserve from yourself and only care about what you think about you.

soc_679626,socialskills,reddit_comment,210,"I’ve been ghosted a few times by men and women. Ya it’s a disgusting way to treat people but what helps me is my indifference towards people. I’m a loner, if I made plans and suddenly somebody ghosted, sure, I’ll ride with it. Another day in,i don’t care, I’ll just use the time to take my dog to the park or whatever. It’s not like I trust/expect much from people in the first place. Leave it at that and I don’t blow up their phone. Or give some long winded message on why they hurt me or why it’s immature.

I initiate texting and you get bored and just stop mid conversation? I’ll never initiate and possibly ignore you or pull the old “sorry I didn’t respond for x days, didn’t see your text”, texting is annoying anyways.

Sometimes these people they’ll come back and try to redo plans, make an excuse, it’s up to you if you want to forgive.i usually don’t because I’m trying to put myself out there as a friend and I’m content being alone.

I’m in not much of a place to give advice but acting indifferent wether we are friends or not is helpful, especially with females. It’s hard to act indifferent sometimes though."
soc_666849,socialskills,reddit_comment,699,"in no way are you a bad person. 

When two people have their differences it is because they cant agree on something, from respect, pride, humor, or other numerous reasons. 

I dont know the situation your in nor the context of the people and issue, but heres most of the probable situations that could be happening and what to do about it:

if friend 1 was being a dick to friend 2 and yet friend 2 continued to try and keep a friendly relationship but after so long finally decided to give up, you cant blame em. friend 1 is in the wrong for being the cause of the issue and not attempting to fix it. In this case, if you are really close with friend 2, it makes sense why they are bitter. You should be supporting your closest friend, help them when they need it. and defend them and stick by their side. if the issue is something very serious and personal, then you should talk to friend 1 about how they have been treating friend 2 and why that isnt cool and hope that he can come to an understanding.

on the other hand, if friend 2 was being a dick to friend 1, constantly creating problems until finally getting rid of the friendship completely, then friend 2 was being fake and never truly was a real friend. more so, if they expect you to stop being friends with friend 1 simply because friend 2 doesnt like them, they are being arrogant and selfish. that not a good personality to have from a friend and you should be wary and alert on how they are treating you. in this situation you could talk to friend 2 and let them know that they are in the wrong and learn more on why they dont like friend 1, then work from there. 

finally, and most probable. No one is in the right. This could be a 2 sided situation. both friends could be in the wrong. the best you can do is talk to both, help give an outsiders opinion from both sides so they can learn about how the other person feels (when someone is convinced they are right, they often fail to see the other half, the other opinion)  and hope they can come to a mutual agreement. 

the third situation is your best scenario. a negative times a negative equals a positive. if both are in the wrong, that can cancel out and they can hopefully fix their differences. when only 1 person is the issue, then it will be much harder for that person to change, and for the other friend to learn to trust them again.

this is just my opinion on the situation and how most friendships have issues. Iv witnessed all three scenarios from just strangers i dont know, to actually being one the friends. Its not uncommon for people to have differences as we are all different and this kind of stuff happens alot. 

i will leave you to determine the gravity of your situation, as you are the only one being affected, and only you know what is best. 

just remember that there is usually two sides to the story. learn as much as you can before coming to a conclusion. dont be blind to others opinion and try to see eye to eye.

if it is a very serious problem, understand that there may be nothing you can do to help them. They simply may not want to continue being friends with that other person, and theres not much you can do but wait until the issue slowly becomes forgotten about, (granted that could take years)

if its a small quarrel over a mild issue, try to be there for support and if (and only if) they are willing to put in the effort, you can hopefully get the trio back up and running.

you cant force anyone to like someone, you cant force anyone to do something, and you cant force anyone to fix the issue.

soc_1518226,socialskills,reddit_comment,306,"&gt;I don't know anyone 

[Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com). Nextdoor or another app. Post on your social media stories asking if anyone wants to go with you to x gym or can recommend a gym to you. If you still can't find anyone and are too shy to just go and talk to the gym worker and ask for a tour and engage in a friendly manner then look for a place with a class and sign up for the classes. Then you're new there like most everyone else and all forced to be together.

&gt;how to break into a community

You don't have to win over everyone, just be interested in something and be genuine about that interest and some people will warm up to you eventually. If you're not genuine about why you're trying to do it then people will be able to tell; nobody wants to befriend someone they feel is disingenuous. 

&gt;I'm really frustrated that I can't just go out and do what I want to do.

Why can't you? 

&gt;Would a normal person just go and not worry about it?

Maybe, maybe not. You can't control the worry but you can control whether or not you go. Why not go and say that you're nervous about it. If the vibes are good at the gym people will be kind to you. I recommend engaging in online communities around the shared interest as well, there's a guy on tiktok I see all the time who is veryyy fit and always talks about polite gym etiquette by critiquing callout videos and reminding people to be kind. Surrounding yourself by those positive fitness community vibes should motivate you.

&gt; I think I’m also getting tired of doing stuff all on my own, and not being able to connect with people

Force yourself to engage more. [Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) works wonders."
soc_760828,socialskills,reddit_comment,1011,"&gt;It’s not because I’m shy, I have acquaintances, but nobody who’s close, or I would call a friend. Everyone I try to progress, platonically or otherwise, kinda just leave me at some point.

What does this look like? do they actually leave or is this a ""we stop talking"" thing? If it's the former, **shit happens**, yo. If it's the latter, *the onus is on you to make it happen, yo!* Reach out! Even if you don't get a response, especially not immediately, STILL DO IT! When you have the spoons (energy, points, cards), [***do it***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0). Send that text, spam a bunch of people on facebook something funny! If you're craving the social interaction, *interact, motherfucker!* (Which I say with all love :D )

&gt;I have a bunch of aquanrtnces, or people I talk to at school and even text outside of it sometimes. But no actual friends. 

*Those sound like friends to me, diggity dog!* haha For real though, it's important for you to be honest with yourself about what *YOU* consider a friend. Like literally *make a list if you have to*, that defines the boundary between a friend and an acquaintance! 

&gt;Nobody who’d ever invite me anywhere. People I’ve tried being friendly with seem to literally avoid me and try to ghost me.

Have you tried inviting *them?* And is the second part a *perception*, or a reality? Have you considered that these people are probably as busy as you are with school, giving them the compassionate benefit of the doubt that they don't *not* want to see you, but are caught up in their own lives? And consider that it might be up to you to *force* things to happen (as long as they have the spoons to do so)?

&gt;I’m not so basement dwelling loser

Hey now, us basement-dwelling losers can still be outgoing and active XD For real though this bit basically comes down to seeing that you are outwardly engaged in your own life, which is rad, but you don't follow up on opportunities, or rather you're confused about how they fall apart. That's gonna be legwork you will have to do; what is the literal cause of people not meeting up for DnD, or not having someone you pick up or meet up at the gym with to work out? Instead of broadly applying ""we just stop talking"" as a negative, try to break down the literal reasons *why* that could be happening. Is it scheduling? Did they/you lose interest in the thing? 

&gt;Maybe I’m just not a nice person

*Are you?* I mean for real, are you genuine, are you the kind of person who lifts people up, encourages them to be themselves as you are yourself? Do you provide positive feedback and sympathy/empathy/compassion when and where it's needed? These are the signs of a person who is ""Nice"" and not Nice^^tm. 

&gt;There was a girl, I nearly made as a friend recently, but I doubt it’ll work out. Essentially I tried to date her, but she wanted to just be friends. I’m happy because that’s honestly what I was looking for. We get along with each other, and text quite a bit, but I doubt it’ll last, and I honestly kinda think she only talks to me out of sympathy based on much of her behaviour. She never instigates conversations, and sometimes seems to end them awkwardly mid conversation. Despite this she replies quickly, writes quite a bit, so I don’t know. We used to sit next to each other in class, walk to the bus together, and talk when we saw each other in the halls back when school was on, but I must have been to clingy or something. Even if I am overthinking, it’ll never develop into anything more than texting about school. I could ask her out to something, (platonically), but she’d only accept out of sympathy, and I don’t want that.

This entire bit reads like you are expressly *not* ""happy because that’s honestly what I was looking for."" If you honestly are, *why do you doubt it will work out, and what does that look like for you if it does/doesn't?* If you're looking to date, do so with purpose. If you're looking for friends *do so with purpose*. If a potential date only *wants* to be friends, ***you*** have to decide if you're okay with that or not, and not cling to hope for a thing that will not be. You have to be *honest* with yourself about whether that's really okay with you or not, and communicate that to them. Recognize that you have the opportunity to gain a friend, or leave a relationship that will not benefit you, which only *sounds* selfish, but really what are we all doing if it isn't for ourselves. Even if you do things for other people, it benefits you and the world at large, but I digress. Anyway, find the words, coming from *you*, to say how you feel, that you're really looking for a romantic spark and that you don't want to waste either of your time, or that it's okay if they aren't receptive to that specific kind of relationship but you enjoy each others company enough that you'd commit to being the kind of friend you both deserve. 

You're really young, and you have a looong time to work on the aspects of your relationship conducting. My biggest takeaway from reading your post isn't to join a gym or a club as some silver bullet to your friendship woes, it's this: Be honest with yourself. Do the work when it seems like others won't, or can't, to create, nourish, and maintain the relationships you *want* to continue, in whatever form that looks like. You want to make friends out of your acquaintances? [*Do the work to do it.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0) Ask *them* out, message *them*. You want to date, *do it*, where it's appropriate, but focus on your functional relationship with people; feel how you vibe with them and don't force things that won't be."

soc_1134723,socialskills,reddit_comment,529,"Hey there!

I've been sociable my entire life, my friends call me ""social lubricant"". Perhaps I can help...

First things first, you're not alone. Let's say you're one in a million and literally not even 1% of the population will want to hang out with you. It seems tough, but really, that means there are millions uppon millions of people out there who are *perfect* for you.

You can do this in one of a few ways...

You can do it as you said and mingle in groups, clubs and social events. That means you'll have to do a lot of small talk, which is nothing beyond being interested in the other person and his/her life. If youre not genuinely interested, it comes accross, and doesn't seem legit.

You can follow groups of things you are genuinely interested in. This makes it much easier, because the members already have something in common with you. It shortens the path to a friendship, and makes finding conversation topics much easier.

Thirdly, you can browse the internet. This is, I find, the easiest way to make friends these days, because everyone seems to have their guards up in person. Online people relax a little more, mainly because they're behind a screen name. Problem is, they will usually live far away from you.

Whichever way you cut it, you will need to show an interest in the other person, and perhaps even make an effort to do something you're not fully comfortable with.

In fact, the less confortable you are, the better (at least with me). You take a deep breath, gather your courage, and go for it. 

It's like coming up to an attractive girl. You can't just sit there and wait for her to notice you, even less for her to make a move. You have to giddy up, and go for it. Ive had several hits where I noticed a girl looking at me, and literally just walked straight up to her and made my move. She could be looking for any reason, not necessarily checking me out, but make a move. It doesnt always work, but confidence is by a veeeeeery long way the sexiest thing in the universe.

It takes a lot of effort, even I still get really tired after a night of networking, even after years and years of experience and being super fluent in the language of making friends.

Ps. There's no secret though, you have to find your zone and just do it. It's like taking a warn tequila shot- if you sip it it sucks. You gotta just throat it.

You'll get a lot of misses in the beginning, but after a while, you'll start getting hits. Then you'll find your mojo.

Ps 2. I've had to move several times in my life and start my group of friends from scratch. Every single time, without fault, the first few friends you make will be quite lame (the definition of lame varies from person to person, if you think lame is a geek or a partyboy, it doesnt matter, its up to you). Keep searching if the first few acquaintances don't match up well."

In the other hand I understand how you think about this bc I thought the same in the past, but are things that you shouldn’t be conformist about like your personal goals, academic and professional trajectory but there are some things you should accept like they are. At the end of the day is your decision and you do what you want or feel and I’m only giving advice based on my experience"
soc_635541,socialskills,reddit_comment,197,"What you can learn is that you can actually know your barrier or limit by testing where you can touch people. Because people are only comfortable to be touched by their close friends or so, not by strangers.

But just because you're close friends doesn't mean she'll let you touch what you want. Like a friend is usually limited to tapping or touching the shoulder. While a boyfriend or a husband can touch her butt all he wants. So try to know which barrier you can and can't touch by testing to touch the different areas of her body. You'll appear like a creep if you make it obvious or if you overdo it. So try to limit the touch from 3-5 seconds first. Then if you noticed that she doesn't put off your hand or if she doesn't make  word about it, then she's comfortable. It means you can make the touch longer next time.

What's next? It's up to you if you will throw the words and tell her next. Or if you don't want to risk it, you can just be flirty by doing some things. I'll tell you that when we get there."
soc_1008829,socialskills,reddit_comment,133,"I would at least explain the reasons before blocking her, she already knew how you felt about her back then, so just tell her, look, I thought I could be your friend but turns out I can’t so I’m just going to block you for my mental health, I hope you can understand. (And if she is a sane person she will, or at the very least respect your decision). 

Also.. reading your post it didn’t feel to me as though you were actually obsessed with her, I think that’s a serious word and should not be used lightly, if you actually feel an obsession with her I would recommend also that you visit a therapist so he can help you work through these emotions since that isn’t healthy at all. Good luck!"
soc_509249,socialskills,reddit_comment,250,"This year I started to make a deliberate effort to not talk about other people behind their backs, or engage in and encourage gossip and drama. 
It’s not always easy where I work , and sometimes when I’m annoyed with someone I still catch myself doing it. But as soon as I do, I outwardly acknowledge that I shouldn’t be saying things like that about people who aren’t present, and then steer the conversation away. 

Generally when people start talking about other people, I literally will just act completely uninterested and walk away. I’ve yet to be confronted about it because people will eventually realize that you’re not interested in gossiping about other people. And if anyone like your roommate does confront you, tell her that you’ve made a New Years resolution to not gossip about other people, and that you can’t contribute to her conversation about other people.

In regards to her confronting you about what you told your other mutual friend, acknowledge that it was a mistake and you were wrong to talk about her to another friend, but if she’s so upset about being talked about she should also have the same consideration for other people.

Everyone is different, but that’s how I would approach it anyways. From what you’ve explained, she doesn’t seem to be a very positive presence in your life to begin with. So if this situation does end up hurting your friendship, it may end up being for the best.

Edit: added context"
soc_1341828,socialskills,reddit_comment,259,"And nothing of value was lost. Your ex is an absolute cunt, lass. Good on you for sticking to your guns and not letting him bully you into doing what he wanted.

How you proceed is entirely up to you. For now, I recommend you treat her as an acquaintance you really get along with - you know, don't make plans to hang out or anything but still stop for a chat if you see each other in public, and send a nice message if you hear that her cat died or something. I don't know what your relationship is like with your ex's mum, but I suspect she may feel a little awkward about meeting up with you (even if she really wants to!) because of the delicate social situation here. Wait for her reply before you attempt to be more friendly again.

(Obviously this is totally subject to your relationship! If it sounds wrong, don't follow my advice lol).

I do have another recommendation: Don't be afraid to let your ex's mum know EXACTLY what he did. Don't leave details out. If he's the type to pull that kind of abusive bullshit, I wouldn't be shocked if he's also the type to talk shit about you to his mum to save face. Don't text his mum out of the blue to tattle on him lol. But if you do remain friends, or if it happens to come up in conversation, don't cover for his dumb ass. He deserves to be shamed for what he did. It's appalling."
soc_180089,socialskills,reddit_comment,519,"Couple things:

1.  No girl is out of your league.  I promise.  You may be in different places or into different things...but no one is out of anyone else's league.  I choose to believe that because it is a useful belief to have in my head.  I don't care if it is true or not but I choose to believe it.

2.  The second part to sitting down and writing about the last time you felt unstoppable has to do with the pattern behind it.  Lets say it was DnD for instance...the pattern behind it might be something like:  ""Sometimes I think that I am too focused on what I want.  I zero in like some kind of laser and do what ever it takes to win.  I love spending time with my friends.  We are always trying to out do each other.  Can get pretty intense but I am thankful to have a group that holds each other to high standards""

Now that is just an example.  I don't know what yours is but...Pick out the situation.  Then ask, ""what is this an example of?"".  Then talk about the higher pattern.

Fill in the blanks:  

1.  Last time I felt truly alive and on top of the world was when...
2.  The reason I felt so alive was...
3.  The reason I love that is because...

This should get you to a couple of your core values (the things that drive your life and give you meaning as a person.  the things that will allow you to connect to anyone else that has the same values).  Actually values are the things that connect people deeply.  This is why there is a republican party, a democratic party, sports teams, religions, etc...anytime there is a tight group, there are secret values underneath everything.

So the goal is to know your core values.  Once you know what they are, you can present them to the world loud and clear so they are easy to see by anyone.  Once you communicate them clearly, anyone who sees the message will immediately feel drawn to you and they won't know why.  

Birds of a feather flock together.  Humans link up based on values and flock together.

So the more honest you are in your profile, the easier it will be to find a girl that shares your same values and she will be drawn to you.

We attract what we are.  So be honest and clear about who you really are.

3.  If you message a girl and she doesn't respond, message her again.  She is sifting through 100s of messages a day and might not remember that she liked you.  Think about it.  She is probably swiping 30 guys a minute.  Would be hard to remember the 100s she liked or didn't like.  It is up to you to be persistent.  She wont be.

I would use match's 7 day free trail.  Get all the numbers.  And then cancel the membership.  What would be the point of staying on any longer if you already connected with all the girls in the area ;)"

Regardless who approaches you or asks you out, they can respect your decision, be polite or get angry in return. Everybody reacts different. Nobody want get rejected, but i think strangers can get over this easily. It’s understandable that you don’t know them and you feel uncomfortable. They expect that they will get probably rejected. So it’s not big deal. Just say ”Sorry I’m not interested”. If you will say”I’m not interested in dating”, someone can say ”Wowww, I’m not even interested in you, I just wanted to promote something”. So ”I’m not interested” is enough, no more explanations. if they insist emphasis what you said or  say ”I’m in a rush, I have to go, I don’t have time to talk”. They will give up."
soc_72268,socialskills,reddit_comment,457,"&gt; I know because the people I'm talking with don't give a shit about me. They just want to hear the sound of their own voice. They can't be assed to ask me a few questions now and again. That is the original complaint.

This might be somewhat true. However, this is also likely partly because people are used to others jumping in and volunteering information. They aren't used to having to pry it out of people. If you show no interest in sharing, it's not entirely fair to place all of the blame on them for not asking.

&gt; This sort of makes sense, but the issue I have is how this plays out in practice is something saying ""man it sure is hot today."" It's not a question and it's not something I could have an opinion on. At best, I could say it's not that hot and then I become disagreeable, combative or grumpy.

""Sure is hot today"" is making a statement that you can obviously both agree on. Up to you to run with it. All you need to do is toss in something related that brings up additional topic options.

""Oh man, I know! Can't wait for the weekend though; this is perfect beach weather!"" (can now talk about anything related to the weekend or the beach etc)

""Thank god for AC... I pretty much just find excuses to hide inside when it gets like this"" (can now talk about anything indoor related etc)

etc etc whatever


&gt; This sounds like I'm just supposed to pull random information out of my ass. I don't want someone telling me about how it was -30 one time. It's not interesting. **I sure as hell am not going to just volunteer that information unprompted.** Anyway how would I choose what cold weather story to share? It was cold this one time I went skiing. Or how about when my aunt got married. Or it was cold yesterday. There is no reason to pick any of them and nothing gained from the exchange.

If you're not going to share information unprompted, it means that you will only ever share information when questioned directly. Once again, this is why people are telling you that they think you're quiet and are holding something back.

I'm just some person on the internet. I'm not here to force you to share with people. If you don't want to and don't see any reason to... then don't. But hopefully you understand why people have made these observations about you and hopefully you'll be a little less bitter when talking to people knowing that it was **your choice** not to get involved in the conversation and not 100% the others person's responsibility."
soc_801311,socialskills,reddit_comment,380,"Don't compliment people on their bodies or their looks, in general. It's definitely creepy, especially when directed at women.  But her inviting smile could also be translated to ""I really like how friendly you are"" or ""you seem like a really kind person.""

You can comment more easily (less creepy/threatening) on a person's energy (like kind, friendly) or on something they're wearing. But if you have the tendency to come off as creepy maybe test this out with a female friend. Maybe stick to accessories rather than clothing covering their breasts or butt. Not that there's anything wrong with saying ""that's a gorgeous dress"" but you don't know how that's going to be taken, especially if you're not sure about how your tone of voice and body language come across. Something like ""that's a great colour on you"" might come across as more neutral. Also remember that everyone is different. One woman might love compliments about her smile or her eyes, another woman might find it invasive. Just be genuine, respectful, and keep it light. Maybe practice on people who are less intimidating at first. Find something you like about everyone you meet (not just the attractive people). Compliment people in passing. That's a lovely coat, great shoes, pretty earrings, love that colour. That's a fun umbrella. I do this with people who are walking in opposite directions on the street sometimes. It will help build your confidence.

You could say something like, ""hey, it's your again! Your smile is the best thing about my morning."" But say it while you're about to walk away or passing her, if you can. If she's standing across from you and you're behind the desk, it could be awkward for her as she's the one who'll have to walk away. Give her the compliment casually and then walk away. 

Edited to add: also, don't give compliments in order to get something from someone. That's always creepy. If you just want to compliment her because you think she's lovely and she needs to know it, that's great. It's even better because women are used to men complimenting in order to get a phone number or sex. So if you don't have any motives other than to let her know she's awesome, you'll do fine."

She may seem standoffish but that doesn't inherently mean she doesn't like you. Like others are saying, she may just be terribly shy or anxious. I know as an anxious person myself, my social skills are abysmal and i probably come off to others as unapproachable or uninterested, when really I'd like to engage more but can't seem to do it. I often hope the other person might persist in trying to talk to me so i know for sure they actually want anything to do with me. But at the same time i feel like i might fuck up everything with them so i dont take the relationship seriously, meaning they lose interest eventually."
soc_1510820,socialskills,reddit_comment,827,"&gt;Well because it often ends badly if the woman is the chaser.

What, it doesn't often end badly for men when they're the chaser?  If you think it doesn't, you *really* need to get out and touch grass.

&gt;Women often get taken advantage of in heterosexual relationships. He could have a couple other women in orbit.

What, this doesn't happen to men?  This is *literally* what FDS advises women to do (that is, have several men in ""orbit"" at once and not tell any of them, and use *all* of them for their money).  Again, I quote myself:

&gt;There's absolutely no reason why OP shouldn't initiate that doesn't also apply to the man in this scenario

So, continuing:

&gt;I'm a woman with experience so you can't exactly refute my opinion on dating.

Maybe not, but my point isn't to *refute* your opinions.  My point is to point out that any objections you may have are equally valid for the man in this situation, proving that your *opinions* are simply bad advice.

&gt;I'm sure all the socially inept men on this sub would love a woman to chase them. That's why it's dangerous.

How are these two things correlated?  Sure, a lot of men here would love to be pursued, but so would men who are very socially adept.  That said, this last part of your statement:

&gt;That's why it's dangerous.

This is ableist and bigoted.  Just because someone has a deficiency in social skills doesn't mean they're a bad person, or dangerous to be around.  It just means they might need help in a few areas here or there.  If you genuinely think this, you're a bigot (and, for the record, I *hate* using these terms).

&gt;You need to pursue a woman to prove your good intentions and that you're willing to focus on her and put effort into it.

I could just as easily flip the script and it would be just as valid an argument.  How can a man know that a woman has good intentions and wants more than just his money/body if she doesn't pursue him and put forth effort?  He doesn't, so he shouldn't put forth any effort at all and let her pursue.

See?  Flipped around, and just as valid.

&gt;That's what makes a good male partner.

That's your *opinion.*  Not an objective fact.  Again, I could flip this around, and it could be equally as valid an argument:  ""A good female partner pursues the man because he needs to know that she has good intentions and that she's willing to focus on him and put effort into it.""

If an argument is valid for both sides, it isn't a valid argument for only one side.

&gt;She is in grave danger of wasting years on a fuck boi if she's too ""easy."" Surely you understand if I put it like that.

This is equally a concern for the man, though.  He is in grave danger of wasting years on a gold-digger, is he not (OP, not saying you are, but it *is* a risk for a man to consider)?  Or perhaps the risk of a baby-trapper?  Or how about a wife who ends up murdering her husband for insurance money?  Those are all risks for a man entering into a relationship, yet I don't see you bringing ***those*** risks up when considering what ""ought to be done"" here.  This is just an excuse to not deal with grown-up problems like risk.

&gt;And I actually would consider you inexperienced if you've never had sex. That's a huge part of an adult relationship.

Yes, because, you know, sex is such a big part of a relationship next to things like ***communication, compromise, cooperation, service,*** or, you know, **any other relationship skills.**  Relationships have *very little* to do with anything other than sex.  Uh huh.  Sure.  Tell that to all the couples out there who have grown old together, the guy can't get it up, the gal can't get wet, they don't bother even trying in the bedroom anymore, and they love each other to pieces and don't care a whit.

&gt;It's like you're trying comment on a beautiful piece of art, but you're colorblind.

More like I've got one half of a winning lottery ticket, but I need to find the person who has the other half before we can actually cash it in and enjoy the results of our combined tickets.

&gt;You're missing a big piece of dating and relationships. Your religion has stunted you in this area.

Yeah, no.  I'm waiting patiently for the appropriate time I can participate in a very sacred communion with another person.  I have a higher conception of sex as a direct result of my religion, not the other way around (though I don't expect you to understand, accept, or appreciate that).

Yes everyone's situation is different but as I look around for advice I find no one understands this issue because they never lived it. hobbies are absolutely natural for them. A lot of people are in shape and can do athletic hobbies for example, where I'd be laughed out of the room. I can't be a social gamer if I only play a few games. I can't join an anime group if I prefer older anime. I never claimed to be special by the way. My lack of relatability and curiosity are psychological issues yet I am pinned for being lazy. The only void I feel is through the hopelessness of my situation.

The bottom line is what I have been doing doesn't work so I'm going to have to make changes to my approach. That involves branching out and getting out of my comfort zone and in the case of pop culture might involve being something that I'm not. I might have to learn a sport late in life. I discovered a lot of music I enjoy through YouTube or the radio and have relied on them  for years.

note : Most people had the luxury of having friends introduce them to new shows, video games, movies or get them in to sports back in the day. If you grow up isolated you fall out of the loop. an example of this in my life is a pal in middle school who introduced me to T.I. when I could have easily missed it otherwise.

&gt;Be a friend to yourself first before looking for a friend in other people

What do you mean be a friend to yourself? My need for connection is not met by being a friend to myself. I have life I need to live, being a late bloomer means doing a lot of hard work which isn't necessarily fun for me and changing my perspective. I have to gain experience before people will accept me.

soc_316530,socialskills,reddit_comment,277,"So it sounds like you might be experiencing a decent amount of social anxiety, and you definitely don't have confidence in your social skills. Your nonverbal communication is unlikely to be open and friendly, which is going to be a turn-off for lots of people. It's also possible that the read other people are getting off of you is not shyness, but disinterest. If you don't look like you're enjoying the social interaction, other people just aren't going to try as hard with you. You may even be provoking a bit of nervousness in them.

&gt; What's worse is when it's obvious that you're the one with inferior social skills and they make it up to you to be talkative. It doesn't make sense to me. Some time ago, when I hadn't developed my social skills very well it almost seemed like they deliberately went silent to ""test"" me.

Sometimes other people also don't know what to say, even if they have 'good' social skills. It takes two parties to make a conversation happen. If they're asking questions, and you're giving 'yes' and 'no' answers, or just being terse in general, you're not giving them much to work with. 

&gt;These popular people that are so-called masters of social interactions should be great at all these things. Why do we stumble upon some of them that do none of it?

To be brutally honest, if there are other people around who are easier to talk to, they're probably not going to spend a lot of time on you. For most people, socializing is a pleasant, relaxing activity. Why play it on hard mode if you don't have to?

soc_118867,socialskills,reddit_comment,349,"Stop caring too much. I stumbled apon an observation which helped me quite a bit. People who trust themselves in their own skin with what they say and what they do often tend to be the most socially succesfull. 


So how I applied this concept was to stop being the over friendly mr. nice guy. Basically I used to agree with everything that was said and I'd constantly add a friendly laugh to approve the concepts of anyone who dared to talk to me. 


Looking back apon it, it must've made me extremely unintresting. Why wouldn't it be? Who wants to talk to someone who is so easy to win? The louder you can make your inner-voice and the more you respect it, naturally and subliminally the more others will look up to you. This doesn't mean you should be arrogent to any extent, just more trustworthy and confident of your own ideas, opinions, tastes, feelings, ups-downs, emotions, style etc etc... If you can be apply this properly, you may even fall into the alpha-mindset.


Because you deserve it as much as anyone else on this planet. You decide how much people like you, the more you love yourself, the more you'll be loved that's a naturual law.

So. Stop being afraid of owning your own opinions and certainly dont be scared to stand by them. In a convo, instead of constantly thinking about the atmosphere and emitting friendlyness and constantly giving approval of what's being said, try to imploy your own ideas and add whatever you think is necessary, be overall interrested in whats being said. Think of your natural persona and sit yourself properly into it. Love yourself for it, and love who you are. 

This is probably quite a paradigme-shift, therefore it will definitly take time to adapt but its perfectly possible and worth it. I'd suggest you let it act as a ""seed"" which grows in you for the next coming months or years even.

soc_478795,socialskills,reddit_comment,309,"Hey, I don’t think it’s wrong to feel resentment. Are you supposed to not feel anything about it at all? We’re only human and have feelings.

Resentment and hatred are feelings that can exist, just don’t want them to stick around long enough to turn into bitterness. 

We’re always looking for someone to blame for our misfortune, whether it’s ourselves, our parents, friends. But most people don’t do these things with bad intent. Your mom didn’t home school you because she wanted you to suffer. It’s something that happened that has had effects on you, and you aren’t to blame either. It’s just something that happened.

Maybe the question is, after feeling the anger and blame and frustration, which is totally normal, what do you do next? I don’t think wanting to disown them is the right step, it sounds like. 

It’s really up to you. How much do you want to get out and develop social skills? How important are they to you?

In some ways I’m in a similar boat. My mom didn’t home school me, but I’ve carried around years (decades) of resentment for her not loving me and frankly being a kind of scary person when I was little.

Therapy has showed me that sure, some of this stuff might be her fault and mine. There’s no real point in pointing the finger unless to assuage my own broken ego and sadness. Which is normal I guess. But now I’m thinking: I still have maybe 40 years left on this planet, what do I do to develop my self esteem so I can be happier? Maybe this is like your case too developing social skills? No need to be too harsh on yourself over it, imo. Take it slow and do it at your own pace. You are okay and acceptable as you are now."

soc_727333,socialskills,reddit_comment,1083,"Fucking hell. I am not a lawyer I am not a therapist I am just a dude on the internet so proceed with that in mind.

In many states in the US, a 19 year old having sex with a 16 year old is illegal and he could do serious time and face serious legal consequences for the rest of his life. If the photos are of you when you were under 18, he is in possession of child pornography.

It was NOT your fault for sleeping with him, however many times you did it or in whatever context. It is considered rape that he and his friends had sex with you while you were black out drunk EVEN if you consented beforehand as you were not in a state to be able to revoke consent during the act. If I was sleeping with a girl and she wanted me to stop and I continued, that is rape.

But legal steps are difficult to take for many reasons. So I will from here on offer personal advice rather than legal.

This man took advantage of you. He called you names and manipulated you. In a healthy relationship, these things do NOT happen. You are RIGHT to consider him a rapist, waste of space, asshole, arrogant, etc. He is NOT ""always nice"" to you. He is manipulating you with PHOTOS and with FAKE KINDNESS to try to keep you hooked in. He is doing this because so far he has been successful. 

What you need to first do is forgive yourself. Forgive yourself for ever meeting him, for partying with him, for having sex with him that one time, and for having sex with him all the times after. Your past actions do not reflect the person that you are and do not control your present nor your future.

With regards to the photos, like I said, they can be considered child pornography if you were not of legal age. Beyond that, he is just using them as a scare tactic. Something to keep you roped in. You need to think about this logically. If he realized you were no longer in fear of the photos getting out, would he still feel so powerful and in control? No.

Think to yourself. EVEN IF the photos were to get out, does that control your life? Would your parents, friends, and family abandon you over these photos? And if they were to, would the lack of support they ever had for you even make it worth caring over? If they are the kind of people that would turn on you over these photos, they do not deserve to be in your life. And that's IF he ever had the balls to do anything with the photos.

If you have a good relationship with your parents, talk to them. Tell them you made a mistake when you were younger and that he has photos of you. Your parents should be understanding. It might be hard for them but if they love you they will be a source of support not criticism. Even if NONE of your family/friends turn out to be the caring people you needed, you still have yourself. Realize that NO MATTER what ANYONE on this green Earth thinks of you, photos or not, that you still will go on living.

Next time he threatens you, tell him to fuck off and tell him you don't give a fuck WHO sees the photos. Say it and mean it. Realize that the photos, if they ever get out, can change your life in ways you may not want, but if you let this man keep doing this, he will FOREVER control your life. Free yourself. Shed yourself of your past and move on to a better future.

When you confront him, he WILL try every tactic in the book to rope you back in. He will try to remind you all the things he did for you, everything he has against you, he will call you names and all sorts of things, he will remind you of all the things YOU did and what a shitty person YOU are. When he does these things, realize that is is just a desperate cry for help from a pitiful man losing power over another human. Even if he brings up things YOU may have done, so that it's not ""all his fault"", REALIZE and ACCEPT that EVEN IF you did things too, it DOES NOT mean they make you who you are. You are going to move on from this situation even if it means moving on from mistakes you made. Even if it was you who kept coming back to him or WHATEVER the fuck, it DOES NOT MATTER. You are DONE with him and NOTHING, not PHOTOS, not THREATS, not BLAME will bring you back. Block his number, every number he tries to use to contact you, all his emails and fake emails, EVERYTHING. Begin your life anew.

I don't care what happened in your past, what mistakes you made, who you made them with, or if you kept making the mistakes. I don't even care if it is partially or even fully your fault that all this happened or is happening, as I'm sure he will try to convince you. And he will. You deserve a life full of kindness, happiness, and love. You deserve a life that is fully yours and in your own hands and control. Another human being, especially one so despicable, does NOT get to control you and manipulate you, no matter how much you are to share the blame for the situation. Yes, you and him had sex while you were drunk. Yes, you chose to continue hooking up with him. None of that matters and none of that can be used to hold you back from escaping from this hell. Because it is also your choice to continue living a fulfilling life despite of it. Is is your CHOICE to cut him off and never go back. It is your CHOICE to be happy.

You have been through hell and I can't imagine all the ways this has taken a toll on your daily life. Please, for your own sake, regain control of your life. Choose to be happy, choose to be in control, and choose to move on completely and fully.

- don’t make comments about someone’s body. They may have lost a ton of weight due to a debilitating health condition or eating disorder. Save your compliments for stuff they can control easily, like their clothes or their work. 

- the person serving you has far less power than you assume they do. They’re not the ones who caused your internet to die, or the random thing to not work. Treat them as the messenger, and not the perpetrator of the shitty situation. 

- in a restaurant, ask for separate cheques at the beginning of the meal. If you didn’t remember to do so, split the payment in half, and then work it out amongst your friends later, when the waiter isn’t trying to just get on with their day. 

- online, assume good faith until proven otherwise. Unless someone is obviously being a troll, assume that any ignorance is genuine. 

- in an argument, don’t expect someone else to Google for you what you can Google yourself. We‘be all got a limited amount of patience to deal with the world, and you purposely being ignorant, and expecting everyone else to do your googling makes you an entitled jerk, and nobody wants to talk to you anymore."
soc_1745671,socialskills,reddit_comment,490,"Yep, same. I put my phone into do not disturb mode at certain times of the day, but I'm not exactly in the habit of telling people about it because it's not really their business. People around me know to call if something is urgent, but other than that, most of my friends are okay waiting a bit for a response, because after all, they can't always respond right away either. You don't know if somebody is sleeping, working, swamped with meetings, driving, etc.

If I'm in a text conversation and getting the sense that it's important, then I will make a special effort to stay present (for example: supporting someone through a hard time).

Other than that, I like having conversations going throughout the day, but I don't really like the pressure of being expected to respond right away. If I need to respond right away, you need to call me, and I hate being called, but then at least we get it over with. The whole appeal of texting is that you don't need to respond right away, the other person will respond when they have a moment.

That being said, it's not quite that simple when it comes to romantic relationships. If you need more contact or more consistent contact than your partner, that is something that you need to work out between yourselves. If they tell you that this is just who they are and they're not changing, you have to decide if you're happy with that. And you don't have to be okay with whatever somebody gives you, either. You can ask for more, or you can decide to enter a relationship where you do get what you want. There are many different people with many different texting styles all over the world, and I see these questions on the Internet all the time, and can I just say, I have dated more people who are more attached to their phones than the other kind. I am quite attached to my phone, and I don't necessarily like to respond right away, but I'm also not going to leave a romantic partner hanging if I can help it. If they need way more contact than me or vice versa, the relationship's just not going to continue. I'm not going to be in a relationship where there is a huge mismatch in either direction. Honestly, I think a lot of these questions just come down to both incompatibilities in terms of texting styles and how much both parties like each other. If somebody really wants to be with you, they'll make an effort, and sometimes that means pulling their phone out of their pocket more often than they otherwise would in an attempt to compromise. Somebody who won't do that is not worth your time - and I don't mean that in a negative way, I just mean that you're incompatible and it's not worth stressing over."
soc_806746,socialskills,reddit_comment,241,"Firstly, I am so sorry to hear you were in an abusive relationship :(

In terms of what you tell people, I think it comes down to personal preference and what you feel comfortable with. If it were me, I would probably only share it with close friends as it is something that is deeply personal - it is up to you though. 

Social media isn't mandatory - there are plenty of people who don't have it at all. Most people don't even ask why you don't have it. In the rare case someone does ask, if you are comfortable saying the true reason, feel free. However, if you're not close to that person, you can say you just don't have it or that you don't really know - no one questions too deeply so I wouldn't stress

In regards to explaining why you have no friends: I'll be honest, I have never heard of that question being asked. People generally don't care or assume you have friends they aren't acquainted with. In my experience, I wouldn't stress about this question either but if you have personally been asked this question before, hopefully another redditor is able to offer you guidance.

Best of luck!

Edit: So short answer is no, I don't think it's something you need to be upfront about when making friends - friends who are worth your time wouldn't drop you for having been in an abusive relationship"
soc_23770,socialskills,reddit_comment,169,"I agree that calling often conveys more confidence than texting, but that doesn't help if she doesn't pick up your call or return the voice-mail.  I believe you would use the term ""it went stale,"" judging from your reference to pickup material.

However, in this particular situation, there is an exception to that rule.  Here, sending a single text will help to lay a foundation that will make it easier to get that first phone-call answered.

That, and it is just courtesy so she doesn't feel uncomfortable answering the phone not knowing who it is.  Could be a bill collector or a stalker, who knows.  She certainly won't.

After that initial text you can feel free to call.  Plus, if she texts back right away, you know its on.

Also, I think texting done properly is a very good way to talk to a girl if you're trying to amp up attraction.  Remember, its all about how comfortable you are talking to her, not the means of communication itself."
soc_835836,socialskills,reddit_comment,175,"I think of it in terms of impression management, the process by which you consciously or subconsciously try to impact people’s perceptions of you. You act differently with different people in different situations. You may talk in a different tone of voice with your friend than with your parent, and a different tone with your parent than a stranger, etc. Your mom may describe you as passionate and loud while your neighbor describes you as meek and quiet. Neither are wrong, that could be how you are with them and how they perceive you. We are different people depending on who we are around. 

When people say “be yourself”, I think they mean that you should impression manage so hard that someone’s perception of you isn’t who you feel like you actually are. Making jokes you don’t think are funny because you think the other person will think it’s funny, for example. Or if you think extroverts are more like able so you try to make everyone think you’re an extrovert, that’s probably too much."
soc_206077,socialskills,reddit_comment,163,"I'd say, you don't ask.

First of all, it's a weird question, when out of context. Obviously if you're discussing relationships in general, you might be able to just ask that question without any problems.

Secondly, when you ask her out, you usually wouldn't say that it's a date. Example: She mentions a movie she wants to watch and you say, you should watch it together. Most women are good at picking up those sort of hints, so she would probably understand you're trying to ask her out. Then, she might mention that she has a boyfriend, in whatever way. After that, you could probably play it down (you didn't ask her out, you're just friends). Of course, if she has a boyfriend and doesn't tell you at that point, you're a good friend she likes to hang out with. Your choice what to make of that.

After all, *asking her out* isn't exactly something formal, it's just an invitation to hang out."

It's not ideal but banter they're not as good as you in reading the room/emotions like many guys. Which makes sense since they tried to apologize for it. If you don't care then don't hang with them I guess. But try to see from there point of view if they really just bullying you or tease you even after you tell them it's not okay then they aren't your friends. Or maybe they tried to have a fun night make you drink a little for fun and just said shit for fun because you didn't want to because they don't want to be boring. Like this shit doesn't sound good obviously but is normal and can be because of numerous reason. It doesn't need to come from hate with other words. Not saying your in the wrong just saying I know where they are coming from. If you don't trust them or don't talk to them is your choice

I dont know why that is though. Maybe because I know what I am doing at work and I am there to do my job not be social, talking to coworkers is just part of the job right? Not actual socializing?

Is just to be honest. 

Go anywhere you want and talk to anyone you want and be okay with letting them know you feel nervous if you feel nervous. They’ll be more comfortable around you and you’ll also feel more comfortable getting it off your chest. 

A good way to start would be to talk to one of your friends about everything you’ve been going through just to get used to being more open with people.

You could even tell people you just met that you’re looking to make new friends and work on your social skills because you often run out of things to say. 

You’d be surprised how many people will open up to you quickly if you’re vulnerable with them first"
soc_242277,socialskills,reddit_comment,397,"Personally, I am so much more interesting in a one on one environment. Being in a group setting is not my favourite. 

This is because my mind is so complicated, that I have to know the other person well enough to be able to share my thoughts and ideas. 

I can talk about small petty things, but that's very draining for me, but I'd much rather talk about the deeper meanings in life and about the inner workings of someone.

I don't think you should feel like you ""need"" to be that type of person. 

Embrace being an introvert, because when the right people come along to hear what you have to say..... they'll be amazed.

I have people all the time say that I would be a good speaker. Which I don't disagree with as long as the topic is on something I'm passionate about.

Group socialising might not be your thing. If it isn't, then that's okay. The world wants you to feel inadequate for not being so, but don't worry about that.

Where I work, there are people I click with and people I don't. Many of them like the whole group chit chat thing, but I don't. Mainly because the topic of conversations aren't what I'm drawn to and also drain me mentally.

However, for the few that I enjoy talking to, we have amazing conversations for hours about deep crazy random topics.

I have a list of questions that I write in my phone, because i'll get the idea at some random point and if I don't write it down it's gone. 

Even stories about my life that I would like to share at some point, I have them written down. 

You also have to learn how to ask questions. 

The usual open ended questions are great:

Who's someone dead or alive you'd love to meet?

One of my favourite questions is ""why?""

This one usually follows a question before.

One of my friends refused to answer a simple question of mine because I always go so much deeper into the answer they give me with, why?

""I'm not going to tell you because you're going to ask me why.""

Learning to ask questions is a skill. You can ask lame boring questions that sound like you're interviewing the person, or you can ask ones that make them think and look internally.

soc_171564,socialskills,reddit_comment,119,"I completely agree with you on this one. One of the hardest things I find about going out to bars and chatting people up is this very thing. 

Personally though, I do think it's rude. It's almost the same as someone else being mid sentence and you just walk away from them, talk to someone else, and then come back and be like ""Sorry, what was that?""

I go out of my way to avoid being on my phone around friends, and will designate time (maybe when someone goes outside for a cigarette or to the bathroom) to do a phone check but never when I am with friends. 

Makes me a little upset too but I understand it. "
soc_175482,socialskills,reddit_comment,327,"First of all, congratulations on taking so many **calm** steps, not rushing or pushing yourself too much! A little bit further than your comfort zone is fine, but it's probably best not to overdo it as it would probably lead to awkward encounters.

As you describe it, she's definitely interested in hanging out with you but we can't really know for sure if she wants something more than that too (ie sex). You'll have to hang out with her a bit more to find out how she sees you (friendly or romantically). :) 

I think your approach is good but it also depends on how far she lives. If she lives like 2 hours away maybe it would seem a bit awkward but then again America is huge so what does a little European know about distances? :)

As far as conversations go, I can totally feel you but I found out it's actually anxiety that holds me back from long conversations. I used to have depression too. I would sit all day by myself and play a single video game... But even so, I still had my own opinions, read the news sometimes..so unlike what I thought, I wasn't completely shut off. Therefore, I'm sure you too, have your own opinions, aspirations and other interests. I'm sure that you'll eventually find something common. 

Something interesting, is that I've always thought I didn't have much to say and stressed myself to find a topic to talk about. But then, it struck me... ""Why do **I** have to find a topic?"".. So instead, I would stay silent for a bit and let the other person initiate a new topic. 

All in all, that's just my opinion so don't take everything to heart. Some points may be completely out of sync with how you act as a person or what you're currently experiencing.

I sincerely wish you continue your efforts and being happier!

soc_649291,socialskills,reddit_comment,128,"I mean it depends on the person and the context. More often than not, I hate it and make a point not to do it unless it’s absolutely necessary. I want the people I spend time with to feel like they are a priority. Some people have definitely not given this much thought unfortunately. I would recommend pointing it out casually and see what happens. Certainly in some cases I don’t mind because it actually signifies a level of comfort beyond this general rule but if it’s gone on too long, it’s also an indication to me to be a little more proactive about finding something more engaging for us to do or parting ways to do something that I actually find exciting. I’m too restless for that."
soc_1760714,socialskills,reddit_comment,763,"As far as connecting, I have been improving in that area when I started doing indirect and friendly only approaching. Direct approaches didn't work at all because to a lot of women my size and strength and height combined is physically intimidating (I assume: I'm 5'11"" but wear black chelsea boots that make me 6'1"", I weight 230lbs, and I dress with a leather jacket, white or grey v-neck shirt, and black, grey or blue jeans, I have a 12mm stubble beard and mustache, and a short buzz cut hairstyle (brown hair)). 

I tried to wear things that make me look soft, but it ended up looking more emasculating (like a loose knit beige wool sweater). 

So I've been doing more indirect approaches now. I make a contextual comment that seems relatively innocent, and I try to branch to emotional connections off of the conversation. I don't ask for her number until I felt a decent spark of an emotional connection with her. When I ask for her number I say ""it's been awesome getting to know you, would you want to get coffee with me tomorrow?"" ""Yes, sure"" ""ok what's your number?"". 

The last girl I did this with was the park bench girl. She's a behavioral health technician that works with autistic kids. She was on the phone with her mother at the time I sat down (didn't see the air pod in her ear at the time). I asked if she minded if I took a seat, she motioned to go ahead and scooted over so I could sit. I sat down and tried to casually ask her how her day is going, she then alerted me to the phone conversation she was on with an ""I'm on the phone"" gesture.

 I thought that was the end of it, so I sat idly for a few minutes taking pictures of the beautiful lake and sunset on my camera, and browser through photos to keep or discard. After about 3 minutes she ended her conversation with her mom and she said ""sorry about that!"" Inviting me for conversation.  We talked about her mom and how close she is with her family and we talked about her work with autistic kids.

 I mentioned how autism runs in my family and two of my 5 siblings have it. We chatted a bit more about the impact of autism on everyday life and its challenges. I then asked her if she finds her work rewarding (an open ended but also closed question: if she speaks a lot then she's enjoying the conversation but if she just says ""yes"" then I know she's not....I use these kind of questions to measure engagement), she said yes and went on explaining what she enjoyed most about her work.  

By this time about 10 mins has passed and I say ""I've really enjoyed connecting with you, would you like to get coffee sometime? "" ""Sure"" ""what's your number?"" ""Xxx-xxx-xxxx"" she then says ""ok, well I better go make dinner"", I reply: ""ok, well it was nic meeting you. You're quite beautiful by the way""(this was a mistake I know, learning from it now) and leaves the bench. I call her 2 hours later (7pm) and she doesn't answer, so I text asking her when she'd be available for coffee. 

She then replies ""sorry I missed your call, but I did some thinking: it was nice talking to you, but I really am not looking to date right now"" . She was a lovely, sweet girl, and it sucks I missed out on this one because other than my comment at the end calling her beautiful , I did this approach almost perfectly. She was emotionally+ personality wise just my type: close and loving connection with her parents, working in a way to better the world, and appears to really care about others. 

So to the commenters saying I'm going after just ""any"" girl, that's not true, I'm making myself available to any girl I find physically attractive to see if they have a personality and emotional connectedness that attracts me. There were some women whom became very ""ugly"" the moment they opened their mouth: so I'm not JUST going after looks. 


....
As to not liking people: I don't not like them generally, but I don't enjoy being around most people, because they bore me. My brain is more feminine in the sense that I am a more emotional guy, and most guys don't really connect that way with other guys.

soc_848076,socialskills,reddit_comment,252,"Another introvert here who hates being told they are too quiet and feels like it’s rude and unnecessary. It’s kind of like telling someone they look tired. I think you might be upset because it tends to come off as not just a passing comment but a judgment of your character and worth...like am I only valuable to you if I can run my mouth? And it’s also an empathy thing...if your roles were reversed would she appreciate you telling her that she was too quiet when she thought you all had a great time? 
That’s life though. People say ignorant things and it’s up to you to figure out how you’ll react. Boiling over every time something like this happens will only stress you out more and keep you from getting to the bottom of what’s really going on and finding peaceful resolution for yourself. I agree with an earlier commenter about just owning it (yeah I’m a quiet guy but enjoyed our conversation). It shows confidence—yeah, people might see you as quiet but who cares, you like yourself the way you are, and you like her. If she has a problem with it, then maybe it’s not the best relationship for you both. But don’t take it out on yourself. As long as you know YOU enjoyed the conversation and tried your best to be present with her and listen and respond to what she was saying, that’s enough. Other people can take it or leave it.

And if you're quiet by nature, there's no magic strategy to suddenly make yourself talkative.

soc_1818518,socialskills,reddit_comment,423,"&gt;Attractive women don't buy drinks

You think this is a categorical law of the universe? 

Believe me, attractive women buy drinks. Buying a drink does not necessarily mean they want to sleep with a man, though they might just want to talk.

You described yourself as just sitting at the bar, kind of aloof from people. Maybe she thought you looked lonely and could use a conversation?

Is that an ""ulterior motive"" in your opinion? Simply being friendly? Because it is highly, highly unlikely to be anything beyond that or an attempt to flirt.

Probably she had no agenda. Let's just do a thing and see where it goes.

&gt;getting compliments at a bar about your clothes just screams ""nice outfit, but I'm not attracted to you"" lol

Come on. You don't seriously believe this, do you? Talking about peoples clothes is a tried and true ice breaker. 

Most people go to bars to meet other people and have a good time. They frequently say, ""hey nice shirt"" and much like buying a drink, it often means they are attracted to you, but doesn't necessarily mean they want to sleep with you, just a friendly way to start a conversation about something more interesting than clothes.

It CERTAINLY doesn't mean they think you're ugly. 

You know a good way to determine how someone actually feels? Talk to them for a little bit. Everyone is different. There's no mathematic THING 1 = THING 2, she did this and so this means that.

These are strangers. You're making wild assumptions about what they think instead of talking to them.

It sounds like you're obsessed with 2 things: your clothes are nice but have nothing to do with your personality 2. You are ugly.

Not everything that happens is related to those factors. And from the story you told, even through your own lens, it's quite obvious that NONE of the events that occurred had anything to do with those 2 factors, except for how you behave.

You're overthinking this, and your thinking is off base.

You come here with the question ""what ulterior motive would a pretty woman have to buy an ugly man a drink"". 

There are 3 assumptions in that question that dozens of people here are challenging.

There's a benefit to coming to a forum on social skills and saying, ""here's how my anxiety causes me to interpret the situauton; what am I getting wrong?""

But you don't seem open to accepting that you might have made an incorrect assumption or two."
soc_13127,socialskills,reddit_comment,887,"This was an interesting concept to think about, but I feel like some of his ideas fly right in the face of everything else I've learned about conversation and social interaction. Take his rule against questions for example. While I would agree that if all you do is ask questions and expect answers from the other person, it's going to feel more like an interview than a conversation, I don't see the need to avoid them entirely. In fact, a lot of what I've read about developing social skills actually has encouraged asking questions to allow the other person to talk about themselves, which most of us enjoy doing. 

Also, his claim that that ""high status people... almost never ask questions"" feels a bit insulting. I've never liked this idea of alpha/beta that seems to have grown out of the pickup/seduction world and inspires this ""high status"" / ""low status"" sort of talk. It paints people's personalities in broad strokes based on how pushy and commanding they are in conversation. Sure, they may be high status with regards to the topic of conversation, but I don't care much for the noisiest buffoon in the room being seen as elite.

But even going along with this ""high status"" idea, I don't see how asking questions is supposed to rob you of that status. If there is specific information that I want or need, I am going to ask whatever questions I need to in order to get that information. What exactly is low status about knowing what I want and then going after it?

His example replies for the thread about Bob making the football team just seem like horrible conversation. I realize he's using very simple ideas to illustrate his concept, but even the core themes of these sentences sound like really terrible contributions to a conversation. 

""Last Saturday"" is a really weak thread to try to connect to something else. In most situations, a time frame alone is not enough to really jump from Bob and the football team all the way to watching a movie with Joe. They're really not related at all. It feels less like replying to something that you heard the other person say and more like you just had something you wanted to say and were merely waiting for them to stop talking. To keep a conversation flowing naturally, you really ought to focus on the main concepts; subjects, objects, verbs. If your grandmother is showing you her rose garden that she just planted, you wouldn't say, ""Hey, speaking of **red** roses, my friend just got a brand new **red** Ford Mustang and he took me out for  a ride yesterday. It's got such-and-such horsepower engine and a custom subwoofer that blah, blah, blah..."" No. You would keep the conversation related to one of the real threads, either your grandmother, or roses, or gardening. Just like in this guide's example you should really stick to what the other person's actually talking about; Bob or football.

The second example is better because it's at least staying on the main topic while branching out. But it's still really shitty conversation. *“I don’t know how people can watch football for hours at a time
on TV. There’s a commercial break every 2 minutes. Basketball is a lot more exciting.”* Seriously? The other person brings up a topic that they are not only interested in, but also they are apparently proud of a mutual friend for excelling in it and you call it boring? The worst part is that you're not only insulting the sport, you're also insulting people who like to watch it (like your current conversational partner). Now I agree that football is boring and most of the people who sit their asses down in front of the TV for hours just to watch beer commercials are usually pretty boring too, but I'm not going to say it right to their face. What sort of threads does this leave for them? They can either agree with me that one of their pasttimes is lame, or they can turn it into an argument, and who would want that? An argument about personal preferences no less, which means neither of us could actually win the argument, so it wouldn't even be productive.

Now the first example, is probably the best because it's not putting down the other person's interests and it's picking up on the main thread (Bob), but it's a little creepy. I mean, couldn't you talk about Bob and introduce a new thread like his girlfriend, without giving an account of when and where you saw them and what they were doing. It sort of makes you sound like a stalker. If you want to mention the last time you ran into Bob, maybe mention something the two of you talked about then. Or if you didn't talk because Bob didn't see you hiding behind a trash can watching him eat French fries with his girlfriend, then maybe you shouldn't be bringing it up at all. 

OK, that ended up being a bit longwinded, but I just felt like those were terrible examples for teaching people how to make conversation. I did like the COSI though. That sounds like a helpful concept to keep in mind for when you can't think of anything.

I'm joking mate, rest assured you're just the same as everyone else.

I remember being at Uni and a rugby 'lad' somehow ended up hanging with my mates - we were the 'play runescape, mount and blade and smoke weed all the time' crew and I didn't think we'd get on. Then he spotted my Band of Brothers collection and it turns out he is really into history and the Second World War and lots of other stuff you wouldn't attribute to the traditional rugby lad. 

Everyone is different and likes different things. I don't consider myself a nerd because I love Runescape and taking apart my PC etc. I also enjoy DJing and producing music with my mates, everyone has a multitude of hobbies. You say you'll watch video games being played, some nights I'll stay up watching speed runs of Elder Scrolls or Half Life, other nights I'll go to the pub with my pals.

I think I'm just trying to say that we aren't defined by what we like, especially if we like things that aren't usually the social norm. "

One if you don't have a life as you say, you might be interested in her because she gives you attention when you hang out. That happens to a lot of guys when they meet cool girls who start talking to them. 

Two if you genuinely think you might like her, don't say it off the bat. People don't respond well to sudden confessions. Ask her out on a date. It doesn't have to be romantic, it could just be a friend date. Be like ""hey I think you're pretty cool, you wanna hang out sometime and grab some coffee, catch a movie (movies are more romantic so I'd steer away from this one until you get a bit closer) or go to a party?"" or whatever you think would be a good bonding experience.

You're doing it because it's safe to stay in your comfort zone and evolving is difficult, challenging and awkward, but you have to decide whether you're the kind of man who's willing to sacrifice comfort for growth or if you're gonna keep crying like a little bitch and be scared of girls for the rest of your life.

 You CAN change, you just need to know how and be willing to face discomfort (facing discomfort is number 1, actually). Even if you didn't know what the fuck you were doing and you stumbled on your words and stuttered so much they couldn't understand a single thing you were saying, if you did it long enough you'll eventually become comfortable with it, it's just how the brain works.

You are right, there could be something that comes up that she'll invite you to, but maybe not. You're allowed to ask a woman to a friendly coffee (taken or no), and if you two get along it could become a regular thing. Coffee can be long enough to catch up and talk about what's happening in the world, or short enough to run out of if something comes up. Where as lunch requires being seated, being served, waiting for a check … etc. If you two hit it off she may think of you when they're planning something.

As long as you weren't a downright ass (which it doesn't sound like that's your problem), you can just try again next time you see them.  It's okay to be boring!  Not everyone can pull off being witty all the time.  It's more important to be nice (honestly nice, not entitled neckbeard nice).

Talk to everyone!  Who cares if it goes horribly?  There's no real downside here (other than your mild discomfort).  I read somewhere that conversation evolved to replace social grooming.  I have no idea if it's true or not, but last time I switched jobs it really helped me make some new friends.  I stopped trying to impress people and instead just tried to get +1 friendship by listening to them.

Also, if you're ever out of things to say just talk about them!  And listen!  Like:

Oh what do you do for work?

I'm a teacher

Oh what do you do for fun?

I go skiing.

Do you have kids?

I have two daughters.

Where do you vacation?

Last summer we went to Hawaii

Sounds really disjointed and like you're interrogating the person.  Always ask questions that relate to what they just said.

What do you do for work?

I'm a teacher

Oh!  What do you teach?

Gym

So do you do a lot of sports in your free time then?

Yeah I ski.

Very nice, too bad when you're a teacher your longest break is in the summer.  Can't really ski then.

Yeah, but it's okay.  Last summer we went to Hawaii so it's not all bad.

Sweet!  Who'd you go with?

Oh my two daughters and my wife!

How old are your kids?

Etc.  That conversation is absolutely boring as a hair growing on your fucking balls.  However the person you're talking to will still walk away satisfied and feel like they had a good conversation."

Intentions and perspective matter. If it turns out they were just being a jerk, then yea, forget about them! But it might be they were just insecure and didn’t know how to communicate. It’s good to have a real heart to heart talk and know what’s going on. But not everyone can handle doing that and either run away or just fuck this. So I believe it depends on the person a lot."
soc_400276,socialskills,reddit_comment,182,"Cool to see that there's much more people out there who feel comfortable when speaking in groups but when it comes to 1 on 1 talk, it suddenly gets harder to get a nice conversation flowing. I personally struggle with this in the moment, but how I think when these situations do occur is to just be in the moment, really listen to the other person speak and not the voices in your head telling you how awkward it will be when there's silence, or what do I think to say next. When you really listen to the person without any other distractions of your negative thoughts, you can ask questions relating to what you're talking about and it will be genuine. It limits your need to try and come up with something witty or funny not knowing if that person will laugh or not or find you weird or not. It just becomes genuine and I personally think when you're in this state, funny comments come to you and you're not trying to be funny. Hope that makes sense and helps!"
soc_1507045,socialskills,reddit_comment,576,"From the contractor's perspective (assuming no ill-intent):

- S/he's putting netting on a window that s/he was meant to be putting netting on (bathroom window, which your husband told him to do).

- You taking a shower may have had no bearing to him/her at all, assuming they even knew you were showering.

- S/he holds the window for whatever reason to apply the netting, hears you shouting to ask him/her what they're doing while they're applying the netting to your window, then informs you that they are applying the netting to the same window that they are holding their hand against.

Then, when it comes to what you *plan* to do when they next show up:

- You see him/her and say some comment like ""You saw me naked last time, huh?"" (or however you might wish to phrase it), to try to gauge their reaction and see if they were being predatory last time.

How do you think Mr or Miss Innocent Contractor (if that is what they are) is going to interpret that sort of statement? If I were that person, I would feel *very uncomfortable*, because I would assume *you* were trying to flirt with *me* and cheat on your husband.

So, you come here to seek some affirmation on your position on this topic, and when Reddit starts getting confused and asking questions, you side with the responses that accuse other commenters of ""victim-blaming"".

Ultimately, neither you nor us know the full situation, but we have no reason to believe from what you said that the contractor was at all sketchy. Your own attitude is raising some alarm bells to some of us, however, and they have advised you appropriately. It is up to you as to whether or not to continue to hire the contractor, but I personally feel more concerned for the contractor and the outcome for them in this situation than I do yourself. An accusation of sexual impropriety (including voyeurism) is a big accusation to make, especially for a working professional with (as you state) a good reputation, and is based on the tangential evidence of you choosing to have a shower in the general area of where they were expected to work. Ultimately, if they placed their hand on that window and you weren't in the shower, there would be no cause for concern.

Another point is, that although I endeavoured throughout this entire comment to use the two most common binary gendered pronouns, I think we can all make the very reasonable assumption that OP is a female (cis or trans, but most likely cis) and contractor is a male (cis or trans, but most likely cis). I say this because we all know *instinctively* that almost any other combination of gender identities would *not* come with the assumption of the contractor engaging in predatory voyeurism for being in the vicinity of their workplace. I think prejudice plays a larger role in this case than most would give it credit for. Contractor could easily be a man doing his job - at his defined workplace - that just happens to be placed in close proximity to something that risks being socially damning to his character due to his gender identity and that of the other person. If the genders were reversed, this post may simply not exist, nor the accusations of ""victim blaming"" or accusations of commenters here as being naturally sympathetic to creepy men."
soc_777062,socialskills,reddit_comment,131,"I used to be like this. Best thing you can do is to politely set a boundary. Tell them straight-up that you feel like they are using you or leaning on you too much, and remind them that while their problems are legitimate and you hear them, you have your own problems to deal with, and that you don't exist to solve their problems. You can recommend that they see a therapist so that they can have someone to vent to.

If they have any respect for you at all, they will listen to this sort of honest but polite boundary. If they don't, then you will have to be more forceful. Blatantly ignoring someone can work. Literally telling them to fuck off can also work. It depends on the person."

soc_796310,socialskills,reddit_comment,1100,"You should try Jordan Peterson's, 12 Rules For Life.

You could have a low self esteem issue which has  convinced you that you're not good enough, and instead of looking inwards, you attempt to fill that hole with external validation and approval of others. 
It's a poor strategy to long term development.

I've been in the exact same spot.

Maybe you were like me, and grew up with symptoms of 'Golden Child syndrome', where you couldn't live up to your potential and things  inevitably started to fall apart. So instead of accepting defeat and allowing your ego to take a huge blow, you created a fake persona to mask the fact that you weren't as talented or gifted as you once promised. 

Only you know your story. 

My best advice is to start all over again. 

Start over again as a 22 year old baby. 

As we grow older, we manufacture our own set of ideas and labels for the world along our journey through life. These ideas tend to correspond with how strong we are at a given time. These ideas, dont  always reflect the reality of the world, but are formed with minds that are too inexperienced and weak to accept reality for what it is. We can make decisions that arent good for us, but give us short-term benefits.

Your job is to carefully trace back to the moment
you decided that you were too weak to continue being the person you were, consequently conforming to the notion that you had to create a facade to survive. That's where  you'll find the answer as to what you need to work on.

You may have been weak then, ( and fair enough!) , but you've grown now, and understand that the path of self neglect and facade leads nowhere. 

A few pragmatic steps that you can improve your life is by: 

1) Driniking a gallon of water everyday ( It's a lot !! But you'll thank yourself for doing it ) 

Get the body in an akaline state, and improve your bodily functions and mood in days by consuming a lot of water. The body is predominately made up of water, so you can't go wrong !

You're going to pee a lot once you begin, but drinking less than a gallon a day is one habit I'll never discontinue. 

2) Wake up at the same time EVERYDAY. 

( Even the weekends ! ) I've only managed to get this down after entering the working world. Waking up at the same time significantly reduces that sense of  dread that is felt in the morning. Couple this with 7-9 hours of sleep, and you'll be feeling ready to kill the day. Dont be afraid if you're not a morning person. Start with something a little later ( 8:00 or 9:00 am ) and gradually roll back the time.
I used to struggle getting up at 7am everyday. 
I now wake up at 4:30 am with a great sense of purpose and fulfilment. It takes time, but that doesn't mean it cant be done!!

3) MEDITATE... a LOT. 

Maybe not that much to be honest. 1x10m session in the morning should suffice, however,  I'd reccomend doing it in the morning AND before bed, just so you can distinguish between how you feel, and how the mind wants you to feel. 

These are two different things.

As you gradually regain control over yourself, and mould your character, you'll find that a calm mind is infinitely useful in navigating the world and communicating with others. 


4) Exercise everyday other day. 

Or whenever you think suits you ( just be consistent with what you choose !) We are designed to be social and active. Working out does wonders for your physical and mental health. The type of routine that fits you is entirely dependent on what you enjoy, so dont feel like you have to run or push weights if you dont want to. Find an activity or sport that you thoroughly enjoy ( or one that can at least justify the effort )and push yourself to the limit each and every time you train. 
Also, forget  about the idea that working out is to look good. That's rubbish! Personally, working out for aesthetic reasons is setting yourself up for failure. If you make pain and gradual baby steps forward your aim, you'll make being active occur naturally. 
I dont think anyone enjoys working out, so dont be discouraged when it sucks. It's supposed to! The idea should be: 'I'm weak, but I'll do what I can in the each moment to gradually become stronger than I was yesterday, for tomorrow.'

5) Quit social media. 

Throw it in the bin. Seriously. 

One undertone that struck me was the idea of impressing those that didnt care.

If you had to find an alamagation of that concept, and personify it, I think it would look something like social media. 
Unless you have individuals that you genuinely connect with on the platform, I think you lose very little by letting go of anti-social networking. It doesn't seem conductive to me to compare my realistic point In life with pictures of others portraying their lives as being better they are. 

It's mostly predicated on deception; Jimmy spent his last few paycheck on all those designer clothes that he cant afford to look good for those who dont really care. Stay away from it, it's really not a game worth playing.

6) Surround yourself with good people &amp; avoid negative people. 

These work in conjunction with one another. As someone who doesn't understand what a friend should be, you're going to have to set boundaries for yourself on who you allow yourself to influence you. This is VERY important, as the people you surround yourself by, dictate the person you are, more than you do. 

'Show me your friends, and I'll show your future.'


If you're serious about regaining the time that you've lost, you need to develop an attitude that is focused on growth. You've got to sacrifice the present for the future, paying great attention to each step along the way. 

Life is crap, but you can limit the stuff that makes it worse.

None of this may be useful to you, but if you can take even one thing away, then I'm glad that I could help you. 

Dont worry if you're struggling to become your best self- You've got your whole life to get there anyway :-). 

P.S. Sorry if this seems rushed, I wanted to share some ways that you can better yourself."
soc_1184766,socialskills,reddit_comment,708,"I'll comment as an electrical engineer that dabbled in computer engineering (also involves much programming), currently about 2 years out of college working in the power industry.


I don't think the coding camp would be the way to go. I understand these camps cost a fair bit of money, but more importantly, they compress years of coding into a few weeks. It's very intense and not everyone is cut out for it. I would only do this if you had prior exposure to coding since coding work requires you to sit in chair for 8h a day or more. This is especially the case in the programming industry, which is where computer science and computer engineering majors end up.

As an alternative, I recommend signing up for  coding boot camp or coding 101 type courses on self teaching sites like udemy or Lynda. Com that are much cheaper (20-50$). Same experience of vast amounts of knowledge being crammed into your head, but you control the pace and get a feel for the work. You decide if you like it at your own pace, with a cheaper price. I recommend learning python first since it's an easy language with many interesting courses and projects.


As for your choice of majors, electrical engineering is a huge field. My subfield, the power industry, doesn't really change all that much year to year, but others like semi conductors, FPGAs, etc. change all the time. Many universities combine electrical engineering and computer engineering into the same college since the bulk of the industry skills are learned on the job. Most engineering majors just teach you the basics in college; the actual job skills are taught on the job. You might find that you'd have to further specialize into a subfield within electrical engineering. 


What I'm trying to get at is that I think you have too many majors and I'm not sure splitting yourself among 3 majors will be healthy for you. I'm not saying you can't do it, just that it would be more stress than necessary. I can't comment on physics, but I know one major and have dablled in another (computer engineering just learns languages used for controlling physical devices instead of just virtual, online stuff like websites, but there are common languages and concepts).


I think the best course is for you to get your general education classes done at the community College and explore your 3 potential majors on your own time with cheaper alternatives. For CS, you can take python boot camp classes at udemy or Lynda for 50$ or less (comparable to community College classes). For electrical engineering, get an intro to electrical engineering textbook and go through the network analysis parts of it. Network analysis is the basics of all electrical engineering classes, sort of like basic addition and subtraction is to math. There are plenty of tutoring series on YouTube to explain concepts like khan academy or neso academy. Try the textbook problems. Alternatively, you can buy the network analysis book of schaum's outlines that is a condensed summary of the textbooks concepts with fully worked out and explained problems. There are also network analysis courses in udemy and Lynda. Try problems with kirchkoff's current and voltage laws, mesh analysis, nodal analysis, phase transform. 



**To summarize all of that, I think best choice for you is to finish general Ed classes at a community College while waiting to transfer**. You're not going to have enough time for all 3 majors, especially if you want to make new friends there. Use your time there to get a taste for the course work in your majors. I've outlined ways to get a taste of 2/3 majors at cheaper prices. Then, pick one major that you like for university. Try it for a semester/quarter, then decide if you're still interested in that second major. CS is related to Computer engineering, which shares many common basics with electric engineering. 


You might be able to double major in EE and CE or CS without taking too much more classes due to the overlap. Physics is entirely unrelated and would cost the same as a separate degree. If what I've read is true, its job prospects aren't so good either."
soc_1086275,socialskills,reddit_comment,537,"Try supplementation with minerals and vitamins. Magnesium is such a massively important mineral that over 500 enzymes in your body use magnesium to function properly. 

Exercise is another HUGE factor in mental health. The body is a physical manifestation of the spiritual, inner world. Build your body. Go for light jogs. This will do wonders for your mental as well as physical well being.

Sleep. Rest. Meditation. Comedy. Going to the chiropractor. Getting a massage. Warm showers. Epsom salt baths. Breathwork. Whole Foods diet. All of these will help you readjust. 

What you talk about you give energy to, and what you give energy to, you reinforce. When you speak about mental illness you identify with it as if it’s who you are and you give it more power over your conscious experience. 
I would like you to consider this: 
how do you know you’re “mentally ill” if you don’t know what it is to be healthy? The truth is that you can be healthy because you know that whatever your current state is isn’t what it should be, but you could only know that if you were able to get healthy to begin with. Does that make sense to you? You’re healthy under all the mess you just have to be able to accept that you can be well adjusted mentally. Your beliefs have a way of manifesting themselves in your life.

You’re obsessed with this image of you being “mentally ill” and you identify this aspect of yourself as if it’s your whole identity. What if you aren’t that? What if you are a person who loves to draw? What if you’re a person who likes to go on bike rides? What if you’re actually very charming and funny? Until you let your mind get out of its limited “mentally ill” box you will see that there a whole lot of wonderful things out there that you can enjoy and become passionate about. And also aspects of your personality that you didn’t let shine through before. When you get into your hobbies and you start enjoying yourself and learn to feel good then the topic of conversation will come as a by product because you will have filled yourself with subject matter by virtue of simply doing things that are interesting to you. Then you will have well developed opinions because you’re actually engaged in these things. You have skin in the game. Conversations will ensue.

You need to get yourself balanced out by doing the inner work required. And every other aspect of your life will flourish. Topics will just be part of life. 
What movies you enjoyed. The current weather. What fights are happening. Current events etc. but this can’t happen without you exploring yourself and living your life. You have to fight and work to become well adjusted. And then you have to maintain. You can’t just sit around eating potato chips watching tv and expect that things will change. This is your shot at life. This is your chance at bliss. “Life is short, but it is up to you to make it sweet”.
 
The clock is ticking and we don’t get the time back. Take advantage and have some fun."

I don't know if you should make that default advice. It depends on the person, really... I've heard stories about how pot made the situation worse, but for me at least, doing it once every once in a while helps tremendously... That being said I also have pretty severe anxiety, which goes away while I'm high and about a week afterwards, so that might be why I think it's beneficial.

tl;dr, OP, you have to make the decision yourself, nobody can tell you if you would benefit or not from pot, but it could definitely be a gateway into hanging out with people more often and it will definitely put you in a good mood."
soc_595803,socialskills,reddit_comment,180,"I think the one thing that has helped me improve my interactions with people A LOT is talking to them like they're already my friends. Definitely try to read the atmosphere and respect that if someone is giving you a 'piss off' vibe, just gently back off with that person. But if you feel comfortable around people, they're much more likely to open up to you. It feels like acting some times (which I HATE) but it does become more genuine over time. And my best rule of thumb, when just getting to know people that is, is to not talk about TOO personal of things; sharing fun facts about yourself but don't throw everything onto the table. Most people get really overwhelmed by the emotions/struggles of others because we're highly empathetic creatures. Take your time and find a way to feel comfortable! Then everything will kind of... naturally start to work out. As time goes on, you'll learn your own boundaries and what kind of people you want to invest in. It takes time and practice.

soc_1646231,socialskills,reddit_comment,369,"Your personality matters a lot. Are you thoughtful and easygoing? Like for example, remembering soneones birthday or bringing up something they mentioned previously and asking about it. Or if things dont go according to plan, can you roll with the punches and keep a positive mindset? People see how each other reacts to different situations and may determine how much they like you from those moments.

Do you do nice things for others without expecting things in return? Generosity creates friendships. Buying someone a drink or giving them a small random gift could leave a good impression of you.

What kind of skills do you have that can make others happy? Maybe something like cooking, or curating some kind of art or whatever it is, share it with others. If you are good with computers or building things, offer to help people who may not be as good. It may require some of your time and a good amount of effort, but building and maintaining relationships is not going to be easy. Sonetines all it takes is helping someone once and they will love you forever. You may get burned and have people try to take advantage of you. If that happens, drop them immediately as it is better to have no friends than to have terrible ones.

Maybe a bit superficial, but people are drawn to nice clothes, cars, cute animals...present yourself in a manner where you can gain peoples attention without having to try too hard at conversation. Someone might walk up to you and compliment your jacket or ride and it makes it easier to start a convo from there

As for where to start..maybe just at work? These are people you see often and have some familiarity with. Practice building repoire and give people good impressions of you. Word of mouth spreads quickly..if everyone finds you pleasant albeit not really outgoing, you will eventually be invited to outings and from there can branch out. Or, if you help someone, they may offer to take you out for lunch or a drink, and from there you can build a friendship.

Dear Darcy, 

     Let's talk about bio Friday.

Thanks, but only in the surface level fashion one can thank someone for reading a response to a question they asked themselves; Or perhaps in the more ever growing idea that you are one of two people I've talked to today, and for that I will always be thankful and greatful. I'll always be your pal, the one truest,

soc_270307,socialskills,reddit_comment,209,"- Maybe you are just an introvert. Like me.
But the real deal of what's happening to you, as I see it, is that you are choosing fear over Love. You see, I learned this; Every single moment passing in the present you are choosing. And every option you have can be reduced to 2 options: Love or Fear. 
 We humans have been descending in a downwards spiral and sinking in fear over time we've been on Earth. When you are out in the street or in the subway, we choose fear over Love. We could start a conversation and share some stories or information. Wen we choose to care for the rest we choose to love. And caring doesn't necessarily mean that you have to talk every day to strangers. You can just think them well. Hope for them to find happiness. Smile back to them when your eyes meet and just continue sitting in peace and silence if you don't like to talk... Like me. 
 Se everyone as a reflection of yourself. You Love yourself and therefore you love everyone. That's why they say to ""listen to your heart"" when you need to decide. Choose. Love or Fear? What does always give the best outcome?
 You decide."
soc_727437,socialskills,reddit_comment,283,"I do too; my husband is the smartest person I know, and his coworkers say the same thing— this is a group of scientists with PhDs, doing cancer research. 

My husband can instantly turn something into a pun, immediately picks up on most jokes and can play along, and has a very dry sense of humor. Dude is lightning quick on the uptake and it’s part of why he’s so funny. 

I think everyone is different, and some people are just wired differently. 

Like me; I grew up with my grandpa making jokes like “I saw a pink squirrel with one mitten yesterday!” And I believed it, hook, line and sinker. He was always making jokes that made me think he was telling the truth, but thinking about it for a second made me realize he wasn’t. My husband makes similar jokes, and while it took me a few weeks (!) to adjust to his humor, I can pick it up right away now, and even started making my own quick puns. 

I’m nowhere near as smart as he is, but I adapted. If you expose yourself to enough people like this, and accept that you’re going to look like an idiot sometimes, you’ll pick it up too. Not sure it has a lot to do with smarts.

In fact, some of the most serious people I know aren’t terribly smart. I think humor takes a lot of flexibility and agility that could be associated with intelligence.

That being said, intelligence is NOT the most important thing. The most important thing is being kind. It’s really tough to be kind to some people, but those are the people who need kindness the most."
soc_715235,socialskills,reddit_comment,190,"Um for me, I think social medias are still necessary in terms of contact.. I don't use social media that much, I only use them when I'm at home and have nothing to do, but when I'm in public, or just doing anything outside, my phone is just usually in my bag especially when I'm with ppl.. That's why whenever I'm talking to my online friends and they're asking what I'm doing, my all time reply is I'm laying on bed hbu? Then they'll go don't you have anything else to do? You're always laying on bed haha and me was like it's because I only use my phone when I'm relaxing already 😂😅 I don't even use my phone when I'm watching TV 😅. Sometimes, I'll just scroll through it to check and when I need to be updated with things around me, and it's useful.. but when I don't need to, I don't really use it that much.. But then it's still your choice.. Thinking abt it, it feels amazing like you'll really get time to live the most of your life 💗💗 good luck with itt ☺️💗"

She always gives me advice that I never asked for and always implies that she thinks I’m lacking in some social area... offended! I think it’s totally fine that you feel that way. Totally up to you if you decide to avoid socialising with him/this group, but chances are you’re still going to have to at some point so best to just be comfortable with what you bring to the group. He brings humour and charm maybe, but you bring your own valuable qualities that he doesn’t. Maybe that’s listening skills, insight, positivity, curiosity, grounding, calmness - whatever is unique to you :) No need to try to fit in with him. It’s ok to need others to fit in with you from time to time. Best of luck."
soc_1556474,socialskills,reddit_comment,125,"There’s definitely nothing wrong with being direct, in fact in certain circumstances it can be very helpful! However when trying to hold an interesting conversation with someone you want to give a little more. For example if someone was to ask, what did you do this weekend? Instead o f just relying with what you did like “I went for a hike, what about you”? This could be very dry. You could instead respond with “ Saturday I went for a hike, there were a lot of people there! The weather was fantastic and afterwards I decided to grab some ice cream, what about you… did you get outside and enjoy the weather”. You just want to give a little more, if that makes sense."
soc_439189,socialskills,reddit_comment,451,"Move on OP. Best advice I can give you is to guard your heart. I was so depressed in high school because no matter how hard I tried, girls were NOT into me. When I went to college, I was so fed up with trying to win girls over that I had a complete change in attitude. I decided from that point on I wasn’t going to care. I would approach girls and shamelessly start conversations. Introduce myself, ask them their name, where they’re from, classes they’re taking.. stuff like that. If they seemed interested, great. Keep it going. Smile, but not too often. Laugh, but not hard. I would never give the impression that I was interested in them, only that they were the closest person available and that I wanted to have a conversation. If they clearly weren’t interested, then I cut it off quick and dirty. Let them know they don’t mean shit to me. If the conversation lulls, leave without saying anything. If you see someone you know, call their name and go talk to them instead. This is a mentality that you have to hold for a while, even once you have gotten to know a girl. If a girl suddenly becomes disinterested, you need to leave her thinking you were never interested in the first place. 

A good way to practice all of this is to automatically assume that every girl you meet is out of your league. If you don’t have to worry about trying to impress her and get her to like you, then you’re free to just be yourself assuming that she will never fall for you. If she doesn’t get the impression that you’re trying to flirt with her, she will be more comfortable and more willing to just talk with you. 

Finally, everyone is different. I found that this method worked well for me. It took a little fine tuning and practice (I would literally practice on hot girls I would see on campus randomly expecting to never see them again, so if it went horribly then who cares?), but eventually I kinda got it worked out. If you try this and find that it just doesn’t work at all, then go with someone else’s advice. 

As for this one girl, my only advice is to be as mellow as possible. Don’t fall for her. If she’s not interested, then you aren’t either. Why would you want to be with someone who doesn’t want to be with you? If she is interested, then you need to be slightly less interested. Keep her on the hook. 

Good luck OP. Sorry for all my shit advice. 

TL;DR Never come across as interested."
soc_1732976,socialskills,reddit_comment,204,"some people just don’t like texting or giving everyone access to them at every second of the day. i’m one of those people. i used to feel guilty about it, but now i don’t care. just because you have my number does not mean you have access to me and my time whenever you want it. i’m in charge of how i spend my time, and i usually don’t want to spend it having random text conversations. 

that being said, i understand how it could feel frustrating having people ALWAYS taking forever to respond to you. i think the best advice is to just ask THEM why they take so long to respond. people aren’t black and white and not everyone sees this issue in the same way. 

also…something to think about to put things into perspective is that this is a VERY new issue among humans. we have only been able to have access to one another so instantaneously within the past 20 or so years! yet people have come up with all these behavior codes associated with texting. i think it’s bullshit and that people need to stop feeling so entitled to other people’s time and attention. but that’s just my perspective."
soc_895206,socialskills,reddit_comment,107,"I have a few friends that struggle with this and I did at one point as well. My advice may seem a little counter productive but it works. 
You need to be ok with being alone. This life is your journey and while it is more fun with friends. You find them while trying to find yourself. You need to decide that being without friends isn’t the worst thing that could happen. And when you do things for you, without trying to please someone else. You’ll find friends.

Another thing is people for sum annoying reason don’t like when people try too hard to be their friend."
soc_1065233,socialskills,reddit_comment,298,"I think there are personality traits which are viewed as positive, negative or neutral by the society. Popular people have more of the positive ones and unpopular more of the negative ones (of course money, good looks and some other things play a big role in popularity as well).

 You can't be rude, loud, mean, ""weird"" and expect people to like you...but lets take the trait ""rude"" you might be seen as  rude by some people but not so much by other people.
 Or the trait ""mean"". Some people might think you are mean and others could think that you are not, you just don't take shit from anyone. 
Most of the time it's subjective,  but there are cases when a lot people will agree about the negative traits you have and you if you realize,  that everyone tells you that you are very rude then that might be true and you should work on that, but a lot times you just don't klick with the people around you. 
Just be Yourself is said to prevent you from acting like someone you are not. Instead of changing yourself first, try to find people who klick with you, because pretending to be someone you are clearly not, will not make you happy in the long term. A lot people tried to that and most of time it did not end good for them. 

Some people naturally have personality traits that makes them more popular with others and thus gives them easier time to find friends. However, that does not mean anything, more does not necessary mean better. You have to go out more(after corona...or when the corona cases are much lower)or try to find internet friends. Just don't expect people to knock on your door and start liking you."
soc_289871,socialskills,reddit_comment,407,"It's fine to feel hopeless in the face of titanic problems like this but you gotta start somewhere. [Insert cliche about long journeys and single steps, etc.] Try breaking the problem down. You'll find you have certain aspects about yourself you want to improve but since those are still huge goals and obstacles you gotta break them down a little further.  Then you keep iterating on this until you get problems small enough to solve (maybe not easily, but definitely solvable).  

For example, my doctor told me I have to do a bunch of stuff to not die because I lost the genetic lottery.  Losing weight fucking sucks but I split that into diet and exercise.  Cardio is better for my heart than just lifting so I've broken exercise down to basically a solvable problem: perform 2-3 hours of cardio every week and eventually increase it and add some cross training on off days.  Each run is broken down to three sections: run a mile, go up and down the stairs at the art museum for as long as I physically can, then jog home.  Each of those can be broken down to: survive the next block you out of shape piece of shit and if you really want to get atomic, you can break it down to left foot right foot left foot.... etc.

What do you want to improve?  Your negative outlook on life. Where do you start with that? One major goal should be to stop yourself from your negative spirals of thought and replace that with neutral, positive, or very limited negative thoughts (bonus points for making them constructive). How do you start that? Learn to identify when you're about to hit that point of no return and work on stopping yourself. How do you stop yourself? Only you can figure out what works for you, but you can start by distracting yourself, or meditating, or forcing yourself to think happy thoughts, or logging your negativity and then looking back at it and realizing how trivial it all was or whatever you think will help.

Also since you're clearly depressed or have some deeper issues you oughta look into seeing a counselor or therapist or something. I can type essays for days but I'm no substitute for a professional. If you can't afford it, that's your new goal: work towards that. If you're ashamed, well, that's a problem too but it's not unsolvable."
soc_1107622,socialskills,reddit_comment,226,"I’m not the best at this (I also have no idea if I read something wrong) and I’m only speaking from my experience, but I find that if you use your hands to express yourself, it becomes easier to begin getting comfortable with initiating contact. Another thing is to take it slow since there’s no rush (unless there is?). Maybe when you have a conversation you can throw a thumbs up somewhere? Initiation of contact could begin with just tapping someone’s shoulder or giving them a high five. It depends on the person too! Maybe they’re not the most comfortable with contact (also COVID). There’s also a possibility the person feels uncomfortable because you are, so maybe remember to not tense your shoulders and relax your face if you do that.

Apart from that, I’m not too sure what else to say. Personally most of the people I’m around are touchy, so culture and location play a part too. I guess if it’s in a more formal setting or with adults you don’t know go for a handshake as a greeting? Not too sure, but it’s my first instinct and seems like a decent way for non awkward contact.

soc_767258,socialskills,reddit_comment,222,"This is just my opinion but first I just have to say you're not doing anything wrong. I think that by being polite, courteous and being NEUTRAL is making yourself appear well boring and forgetful. I don't think there's anything wrong with polite and courteous but I can definitely see going out of your way to be neutral make you seem boring or even uninterested. I can't see myself being able to carry a conversation for long by being neutral.    



So what was the plan do you plan to always be neutral, walking on eggshells in every conversation just to not step on toes, That sounds miserable. Your real opinions give other people a glimpse of you're character and it definitely makes for a better conversation. Don't you want to have friends where you can relax and say whatever is on your mind? You need some friction with people,if you want to be noticed. By being neutral you're basically making yourself into an NPC and also dishonest in what you say and i think people can pick up on that.    

Do what you love, say what you want to say just be mindful and respectful. If you offend someone, apologize, now you know where the line is. People who like what they see and what they hear from you will stick around."

Sometimes people just don't mature emotionally like you have. There's no good reason that a father should be taking his anger/frustration out on his child. Zero. With that in mind you'd be best served by understanding the difference between his opinion and your value. Part of which you already do display here with your choice of language.

If you were to try to connect more, I would try to think on what interests or hobbies your father does have that you could potentially share. I know that my dad and I really bonded not over the things I was interested in, he's your sterotypical republican white older dude, but through his interests. I don't like fishing, but it makes my pops happy when I went with him. It helped build our relationship to the point where I could actually talk to him about things I disagree with him about. Maybe something like that could work for you too?

How do you really feel deep down when you're alone, and you're thinking about her. Question yourself. And please be honest with yourself. Don't ruin a good friendship. Be calm and patient and thoughtful of her. Don't be hasty or hesitant. Come to a compromise with your heart and mind. Be in balance and at peace.

1. They exclude you from conversations/ planning of other events while you are wuth them.
2. If they talk smack about others with you, its fair to assume that they talk smack about you with others.
3. If they talk to you like a child or speak to you as if you have a lower intelligence. (i.e. overexplaining things to you as they think you don't understand) 
4. If they have radical political views (on both sides of the aisle) they feel the need to share with EVERYONE. (Not implying you are a bad person if you are passionate about your beliefs) 
5. If they try to laugh off something they say or do that makes you uncomfortable. 
6. If you are mentally ill, and they treat you as if you are not a person but rather the illness you have. (This could be ignorance of mental health issues, simply because they haven't had exposure to it, obviously it depends on the person, read the room.) 
7. The need for them to be right about everything all the time. Arguments with these individuals is insufferable, as they will defend a clearly wrong viewpoint even when confronted with evidence for the contrary. For them it isn't about the view they have, its the need for them to ""win"" the argument. 
8. They feel the need to ""one-up"" everyone in conversation. (I.e. the need to feel more important than others in the conversation.) 

These are a few examples, I definitely could be incorrect about everything I just said. These are some things I noticed that seem to be pretty universal for the people in my area.

soc_849810,socialskills,reddit_comment,418,"Every human being intrinsically holds worth.  By virtue of existing. You are literally a massive coincidence just like everyone else here, none of us had to exist, but, we do.   


I'm not going to tell you whether they are right or wrong, or if you're right or wrong, I know neither you, nor that group.   
What I can tell you is - regardless of your faults, you as a lifeform intrinsically hold worth. Don't utilize this as a comeback to them, extolling your virtues and intrinsic worth, if they are literally as bad as what you say and what you've written isn't magnified(cognitive distortion), there's a chance they will find a way to turn that on its head. You don't need that right now. And they have things to fix themselves as well, because - yes, they too hold value.  


If you have the chance, visit a therapist, you need a support system and a therapist can provide at least one crucial pillar. In addition, add more 'positive' things to your life. Practice gratitude, 3 things you are grateful for, day and night, or just day in the beginning.   
The idea isn't to spit rainbow flavored raps, the idea is to build emotional resilience, gratitude helps us to do so, and also simultaneously starts allowing us to recognize and see other opportunities, and can help change our outlook on life. Find the smallest things you can be grateful for, atomic, protons/electrons, I'm not exaggerating here, believe me.   
As long as you think ""yeah it IS pretty great that's a thing"" then it counts for you, that's it.  
Practice cold showers at least thrice a week or daily if you can. They also aid in emotional resilience. Exercise will help as well, start by just walking/running as those are relatively simple to do without needing the whole trainer/program shebang. Essentially adding more coping methods for your life and environment, and look up classes that can teach you assertiveness in a healthy way.  


I'm tempted to add more, but too much help can interfere with growth and true independence building as well. I know things are hard, I've faced people who 'should' be better, 'should' have been more adult, but those shoulds themselves are a problem, we aren't in that world. But we can become part of the vanguard for it, by learning the things people already in that vanguard have picked up, and bettering ourselves.

You can always just randomly show up to them and ask them why are they laughing, for example. Or just sit by them in a break between classes. You'll slowing be getting in one of the groups in no time. At least this worked for me. As for knowing particular individuals, outside a group, it can get harder because of the more intimate environment. Best advice that i can give it to you is practice. It can be done any way you want : either saying randomly hi to a class mate, or sending good night messages to a girl or something, or even setting different social tasks in your mind for every day. Like ""today i want to make someone laugh. Tomorrow i want to find out someone's crush. etc"" things like these. Being socially active is just like a chore.

soc_1729043,socialskills,reddit_comment,473,"1. Get a job ( any job)
2. volunteer
3. help people out
4. Move out of your comfort zone: Make a list of things you tend to avoid and fears...and excuses you make for yourself...those are things you put in place as your comfort zone. So you now have to walk away from those and just do things to improve yourself. ONLY you can do this no one can really help you and it's your choice to get better. You only have yourself to blame.
5. Take small steps and task to make it to your major goal. Write out your goals of things you want then think about the small task your going to have to do to make that type of goal happen. What steps do you have to take to have that happen. Like building a fence it doesn't just happen look at all the work that goes into making sure that fence is put into place. I am talking about a rock or wooden fence. Not the metal kind or ones that come prebuilt like a panel. I am talking about lumber, tools, nails, several days to a few weeks to make this fence happen etc.

My suggestion to help you is listening to motivational videos (Youtube for free) for at least 1 hour every day for the next year. You can  listen to them longer through out your day but this will help you to appreciate your life and build your confidents. To look at your life differently. They also have good videos on how talking to ladies. I watched a few and reading ones body language.

Then start reading up on how to approach and have conversation. You need to talk to men and woman to just help you build that confidence back up. Join a few groups and learn some new interesting skills and hobbies. Enjoying your life is what you need to do and then if your lucky she might come into your life because you will be in a place in your life that if she comes great and if not...your still enjoying your life.

You jut focus on the horrible stuff your life will just be miserable. I went years trying to meet men on online dating sites and it was total waste of my time. They don't work for you so start looking at other ways. Once you had a bit of time just talking to people again....try speed dating you never know and it will help you to just get used to talking to a woman in person. If nothing comes of it you at least got practice at talking but you have to build up your confidence a bit and get used to talking to humans again and strangers before doing it.

I wish you the best of luck."

Why would you tell your friends you’ve downgraded them unless you are a terrible person and want to punish them, make them feel bad. It’s obvious you lack social skills but come one how can you not realize what you did was wrong. 

I’ve gone years without seeing some of my friends and when I see them we catch up like it’s was yesterday. The last thing I would do is call them to them them I’ve downgraded them. You are in the wrong here, not them. Your behavior is almost narcissistic, you are basically trying to make them feel reduced and punish them because they have a life other than you. If I were them I would block you and never answer your call again. I would be completely done with you. 

You mention you are autistic. I’m glad you explained this because for a moment there I was starting to think there’s something seriously wrong with you. Now that I understand the reason behind your behavior and interaction with them all I can say is that it was wrong of you to tell them they’ve been downgraded. It was selfish of you and an act of punishment. Try to be a better friend next time. Don’t buy gifts for people only because you expect something back. It’s the wrong way to gift something. When I get someone a gift I do it out of the goodness of my heart. It makes me happy to it. I’m not expecting something back. I’m doing it because I love them and want them to have it because I care about them. That’s the only way to do it."

* I can't tell you what to enjoy in a social interaction. It doesn't work that way. I can say that I personally enjoy learning through the experiences of other people though. For example our interactions. Through me giving you advice, my thoughts are becoming more refined and clear, since I have to explain them in a coherent way. And you're pushing me to think more deeply about all of this due to your questions, and that's causing my ideas to become more fleshed out. In that sense, just from me giving you advice and you being inquisitive, I'm learning and developing my thoughts to heights that I couldn't have achieved on my own. I'm gaining your perspective on things. The perspective of a highly rational and amoral socially awkward penguin. 

* Now if I were to talk with someone else about a topic, I could learn from them simply because they have a different point of view. Maybe they're extremely emotional, completely irrational, and is the most moral person alive. I might not agree with what they say, but at the very least they'll get me to consider and think about things that I wouldn't have before, and as a result my ideas will become even more refined. Even conversing with a stupid can be wholly valuable because they see things in simpler terms. Sometimes more intelligent people think too hard about things, and through this over complication, they miss the easy solution or what's right in front of their eyes. Talking with someone who's mentally ""shorter"" than you can give you insight on the things that you're way too ""tall"" to see on your own. To me, anyone who has a different opinion from me is completely worth conversing with. A lot of the things I know now have been greatly influenced by people on polar ends of the moral/amoral, rational/irrational, emotional/stoic, and other spectrums. 

* I forgot to comment on this in one of your previous responses, but it's not a good idea to surround yourself with people who think just like you. Variety is the spice of life. That's how you get the innovative ideas and solve problems. Surround yourself with people who compliment your weaknesses. That way you won't have big glaring blind spots. If you have a team of people who think like you, then you'll get blindsided repeatedly, all while thinking ""how did I not see that coming?"". That'll be the issue. There will always be things that ***you*** won't see coming. That's why you need people who aren't like you. They'll be the ones who see it, and either warn you or take care of it. "

But if i have to give my insights, outgoing is always harder than shy, but is also more fun, but is also more shallow. So it depends on your personality mostly, with a little twist which is that outgoing partners are basically experience farms for you. You can learn a lot about how to handle people (and time management!) from this kind of relationships."

You shouldn't feel bad about it if anyone's got an issue because that's their issue, it's not up to you to do anything about it (and in my experience most people will care more about dental hygiene above teeth shape).
Also, if you decide to correct them you might still spend a good amount of time with braces and devices, so if you already don't mind about what others think this won't he a concern at all.

I want to add that the way this post is written, it sounds like the only option of you being interested in flirting with someone, is when they already are.

Your flirting, or interest in someone, shouldn't be a product of their interest. It should be your decision, and cannot have the other person's choice play weight on your decision.

Answering you -

Do you think that it would make a difference if the other person was flirting or being nice?

If you like them, you could flirt. On your own. You don't need to respond to a cue, you can be the one starting too. 

Or you could just be nice and have a good time making an acquaintance, even if they were flirting with you. 

Very frankly, it might sound to someone that because you would like to get to know someone better, you're willing to make sure every situation works in your favour. I wouldn't recommend navigating that way."
soc_675335,socialskills,reddit_comment,328,"Frame the aggressor as weird, without really being bothered too much. As if whatever happens can't really touch you and nothing really gets under your skin, but you're intelligent enough to notice, and assertive enough to do something if you get a weird feeling. I've often successfully used ""Dude, behave."" very casually, even in the middle of a sentence, and just continuing with whatever i was saying or doing, without giving time to react and leaving interrupters and other disruptives just hanging for a minute. Bonus: if they react, they risk losing face another way. It can be really embarrassing for alpha tryhards and many get dumbfounded. This approach conveys \~ they're crossing the line of annoying, they're doing something weird, maybe enough that they might not deserve Your attention and time. But don't make them more than a petty annoyance with your reaction. If it escalates, I'd suggest an attitude of ""Whatever, man -- yeah yeah just chill / I want to hear that \[other\] thing.""

I think it's **okay** to consciusly react and put people in their place, even just as an exercise. What you don't want is to put too much effort and a lashing amplitude to it. (""What's your problem..? Talk to your psychiatrist."" vs. ""Enough, A-hole! \*rant\*"") The mindset where you can't really get hurt is where You choose your company, you have some boundaries, and if they don't cut it or get in line enough to be properly human, you are ready to abandon them passively and move on. You have other people. You don't hang out with people who bore you with their annoyance and can't contribute anything. Time is finite, some people waste it. You might imply how their value to you is less than zero - a waste of time. This isn't a facade, either. Just and inevitable result of a certain value system.

soc_48299,socialskills,reddit_comment,618,"Liked your post. As someone who has been actively working on my social skills for several years, with good results, I have something to ""correct"", and something to add...

You say your friend has no insecurities, and the way you describe him makes him sound almost flawless, which is something introverted people fear - trying to match, or compete with, someone like this for attention. Well, this couldn't be further from the truth. Of course your friend has imperfections and insecurities, *everyone* does. One thing which really helped me overcome some of this is recognizing my insecurities, acknowledging them and not being afraid to discuss them with others. When you talk about things which are personal, it makes most people open up to you, because you are talking about something many people understand but are uncomfortable opening up about on their own. I am not saying you should open up a conversation with someone by telling them your biggest flaw or fear, but if you want to build meaningful relationships with people, you will need to learn to be comfortable talking about things which may feel uncomfortable to you right now.

A few tricks I've learned:

- Work out. It doesn't have to be a huge amount, but even doing something physical for 20 mins or an hour a day *will* give you a big boost of confidence. This is basic biology. You don't have to be ripped, but when you feel good about yourself, others can see it too.

- Try not to speak poorly of other people. It can be easy, especially for an introvert, to find company by speaking ill of other people, or being sarcastic, but this is a short-term solution, and might be a turn off for a lot of people right away or down the road. Focus on talking about positive things in your life, not in a way that rubs it in people's face, but rather in a way that shows an ""if I can do it, you can too"" attitude. People respect honestly and optimism.

- Don't be a downer or complainer. No one wants to hear that shit, people have their own problems.

- Work on improving yourself by reading (will give you more to talk about), by taking yourself out of your comfort zone (maybe one little thing at a time), being adventurous (to build experiences you can tell people about) and working consciously on being a positive person.

- Be thoughtful. Try to remember things about people you meet and surprise them by even something as small as following up on something they told you they were excited about, or worried about.

- Encourage people. This goes along with the previous comment... if you find out someone is trying to do something cool or even if it doesn't seem cool to you but is important to them, encourage them to succeed!

- Pay attention to popular things. You don't have to love them, or enjoy them, but paying attention to what's going on in sports, movies, music, politics is a good way to be able to have a conversation with nearly anyone.

- Smile! It's true that this isn't the case for some cultures but this is completely fine in the US. When you speak to people, smile at them - don't be afraid to show people you are enjoying the conversation.

I am definitely very much still working on my skills, and will be until the day I die. But, it's great to read posts like yours, to see people are working on overcoming social issues and realizing that being shy or anti-social aren't curses, but an opportunity to improve yourself.

I used to be really good at responding to texts as close to immediately as possible.  I only had a few people I might be hearing from and I really wanted to respect their interaction, even the ones I didn't particularly like getting messaged by.  However, now I have a truly massive social circle and it gets overwhelming.  Even people I want to hear from often don't hear back from me for a few days or at all, because it's easier for me to stay focused if I wait until I see them in person.
I used to get really frustrated by super social people who didn't respond to texts, like they thought I wasn't worth their time even though we hung out a lot and they actively sought me out in person.  Now I understand."

1. Self Respect.
Nobody can call you a floozy or easy and while in today's world that might not mean much but you have earned my respect too. That might not mean anything to you but let me let you in on a secret.
During your teenage years most lets say about 99percent of the guys want only one thing from you  and once they get what you want your history to them (remember that is a secret).
2. There are going to be guys who are going to say that they slept with you. Behind your back of course. You might have friends that hear it and know that that is a lie and will defend your honor. People will try to destroy your reputation. That's just a part of young boys immature lack of self esteem.

My advice is to try to text her more and gain a better understanding of how to communicate with a person that clearly matters to you. She didnt say no shes just not sure.

soc_1444109,socialskills,reddit_comment,355,"I'm prepared to get downvoted cuz I'm not gonna say that politically correct answer.

**Rule number 1: Physical Attraction.**

No matter how nice she is, a guy will always look at her physical attraction before engaging with her. There's no way in hell that a guy will be interested in a woman that he doesn't find attractive. So small waist, wide hips, big tits, collar bones, nice long hair, good hygiene, etc.

Also important to take note that not every guy is attracted to the same body type, but the rule still applies to every guy. If a guy tells you that he looks at personality first, he's lying big time and he's an INSTANT red flag.

**Rule number 2: Personality.**

Once a guy finds you attractive he'll engage with you and see if he likes your personality. If he doesn't, he's probably gonna want to pump and dump you. If he likes your personality, he's gonna stay with you for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rule number 3: Character.**

Once a guy likes your body and personality, the thing that'll make him love you even more will be your character. If a girl shows that she's a good person even after they're together for a while, she's gonna be a woman that he's gonna be willing to die for. If not, he's gonna break up with her after a few months.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rule number 4: Life Goals.**

This is the last thing that will make or break a relationship. If the girls' goals are similar to his, then nope they're not gonna last more than a couple of years. But if her goals are complimentary to his, then she should expect a ring soon enough.

For example, if the guy wants to focus on his career , he's naturally gonna want a woman who ain't also gonna focus on her career. He'd prefer one who will make him feel good once he returns home or a woman who helps him in his career/business.

&amp;#x200B;

Once the woman ticks all of these requirements, she's worthy of marriage and she should be the one to birth your kids."

I got into cycling as it was a way to distance myself from my problems at home and school. The exhaustion was a plus as it meant I could fall asleep easily and wouldn't have to fight my anxiety to sleep. I got rockin' body which gives me shitload of self esteem, and it also means i don't really pay attention to what shitty foods i eat (high fat milkshakes and triple baconators!), because ill burn it off on my next ride. I also do all my own mechanics and I like manual work.

I camp and hike, because I like the solitude, the outdoors, I like to stretch my physical and mental limits, and I Like that people always seem to to think Im a hardcore badass, camping alone in the bush at -30 weather. I set the pace, I choose my gear, I choose the area, I choose the temperature (within reason, i have no control over nature). No one can tell me the pass is too cold, to dangerous, too far or otherwise. I also refuse to turn into a wussy loser who freaks out over 5C, flips shit when it snows, and panics when their soy latte isnt organic.
 
I like cooking, Because I like to be in control of what I eat and I like the whole process of creation. Prepackaged foods are basically your fussy mom telling you what you can and cant eat. I like that I'm free to do things however the fuck I like, And goddamn  it no one can stop me.

* What sort of people do I want to surround myself with? Who would I easily make friends with?
* What or who do I despise, and what do they NOT do?
* What sort of things Do I like doing? (working with your hands, physical activity, Measuring, Short term travel, etc. These sort of answers should be very specific)
* What do I get out of it? How will it improve me as a person? (I want a better body, I want to learn more, I want to create things, I want to make others happy, etc)"

This leads me to believe he’s actually projecting his own insecurities onto you.

It makes more sense that he’s the insecure one. You rejected him after all. His self-esteem has been damaged, and he probably wants to compensate by demanding validation in the form of you agreeing to hang out.

In short, yes, he is likely trying to manipulate you. Maybe not on purpose, but intent doesn’t matter—he should learn to accept “No” with grace."
soc_1271192,socialskills,reddit_comment,578,"TLDR: Have an honest conversation with yourself and do what's best for your mental state. 


Oh boy. I could have written this myself as recent as late last year. At the beginning of 2021 I finally broke up with my boyfriend. We were together for 6 years, but honestly I should have ended it within the first one.

Much of what you said resonates with me and I found myself thinking much of the same thing right up until the end. I felt like I put more effort into the relationship in many key ways while he was content to sit back and let me do all the work. I felt underappreciated. Yes, I even had the love language chat with him (he didn't care though). After numerous talks with no progress being made I convinced myself that I was asking for too much and learned to settle for less.

This went on for years. It had become clear to me that we were just incompatible, but I didn't want to face it. Usually I was able to bury my feelings of dissatisfaction and carry on, but we still had disagreements. I kept asking myself why he couldn't be this particular way, or do particular things without being prompted. I went to various subreddits and spoke about our dynamic just to see if I was being unreasonable. Negative thoughts started to creep into my mind and the seeds of resentment were sowed. Still though, I preserved and tried to make things work.

Towards the end things got pretty toxic and I had to take a step back and realize that this was most likely never going to change unless I did what I needed to do all along. We were just not a good match on some fundamental levels. He was content with things and the only problem for him was my ""nagging"", which was caused by his failure to change. I realized that, even if some things would have been for the best, that I was trying to force him to change who he was and that was unfair. If I wasnt satisfied with what he could provide for me as a partner then instead of trying to get him to change I needed to do what was best of my mental state and leave.

 Evenutally I came to terms with that fact that I wasnt truly as happy as I could be in the relationship and would be more content alone. Now, here I am. Did the break up hurt? Yes it did, though not nearly as much as you would think. I am now intimately familiar with the line ""its a thin line between love and hate"". I feel so much better without the constant stress.

I'm not going to tell you to break up with your boyfriend, but I do encourage you to be honest with yourself about what you want and if he can provide it. If he can't, then maybe it's time to consider putting your energy into someone that can.There's nothing wrong about acknowledging that you two just need different things in life. It'll save you a lot of frustration in the long run.

If I could go back in time and warn my younger self to avoid my ex I would. Six years down the drain and it wasn't even worth it. The only thing I really got from that relationship is knowing what I dont want in a partner."

What you do is you whip out your phone and start using the duolingo app to learn some words of their language. And someone who doesn’t know you yet and doesn’t know you don’t understand the language, yet, but has a good heart is bound to come over and start talking to you in English, offering you help with learning the language.

The thing is, at such a gathering, the people who don’t know you may be hesitant to talk to you, because you are first of all the responsibility of the person who brought you there, and that person is expected to introduce you to the others.

Best way is to just expand your horizons but don't leave your element, don't do something because that what's considered 'cool' or because more girls do it, if you genuinely don't care for it.
Try working on expanding your network, how many people you know (and who know you). Societies are great, just have a look at what tickles you and go and try it out. The goal is to have fun and meet more people.

Don't focus on meeting girls, focus on just meeting more people, through this, you'll meet more girls.

A good question that brings your core values to light is: 
 *""What do you look for in a good friend?""*

Before I understood my core values, my answers would have been ""If they're nice to me and fun to be around."" But those are really vague qualities anyone can have. Think *deeper*. 

Do you value respect? **What does respect mean to you?**

What do you think about manners? About health? Do you consider these important things? 

**What ticks you off?** For me, if someone doesn't even try something when I suggest they try it, that annoys me because they aren't taking me seriously. So, something I value in a friend is that they trust me and listen to my advice. 

This list can go long and deep, and you don't have to understand all of it. It might also change over time, especially as you become more aware of it. And that's okay! But, as you learn bits here and there, you'll become more confident in how you carry yourself, and who you are. 

I would suggest checking out the sub r/stoicism if you have no idea where to even start. It's based around a certain set of core values, and you can decide if they make sense to you or not. 

I find that discovering your core values is super important to mental health overall. It helps you feel like you have more of a purpose in life, because it's up to you to uphold your own values. It's like a more complicated moral compass. It can guide you when you're lost, and help you understand your intuition more. (Listening to your gut is also super important! I'd suggest google tips on how to listen to your intuition!)

There are probably other things you can focus on, like being more comfortable introducing yourself or making eye contact that will yield actual results in 'real life' that will pay you back in spades."
soc_991955,socialskills,reddit_comment,158,"That is perfectly valid, so if you have people in your life that you care about, expressing that you don’t like hugs because it invades your personal space is a boundary you can have with them. People worth keeping in your life will respect that, people who keep pushing that boundary and make you uncomfortable aren’t respectful of what you are asking. Then it would be up to you if it’s worth reiterating the boundary, or give them consequences. You are worthy of respect from others, and you can choose who is worthy of being in your life. That’s self love to yourself. And if you do decide you want a hug, I know it feels hard to ask, but people who love you won’t hesitate and you shouldn’t feel shame for wanting human contact every once in a while. I’m sure the thought feels scary but once you try it might not be so bad after all."
soc_1176810,socialskills,reddit_comment,471,"Admitting you hate yourself won't make you not hate yourself, yes. That's not the point of admitting you hate yourself, and admitting that it's abnormal. 

The point is that, if it's not the ""normal"" ""default"", then something has to have caused it. If it has a cause, it can be fixed. You're not broken, just having a hard go at life. 

It's true, no one else CAN do anything, because change comes from within. Without the desire to change, change doesn't happen. Even if you had, say, won the lottery, that wouldn't make you happy or be something to look forward to because the problem isn't in the future. If you got married and fell in love, fhat wouldn't make you not hate yourself, it'd distract from that and just give you a diversion. The problem is here, now. And the only way to get better, to HAVE something to look forward to, is to be willing to change. If there's a will, there's a way. 

Think of it this way: when you're drowning, even if someone threw you a life preserver, it's useless unless you physically grab hold of it and cling to it. Doing so takes effort, especially if you feel it's not going to help you.  

It's the same way with recovery. 

Self compassion is the most important thing we can learn to help us get better. 

**If you take nothing else away from this, let it be this:**

Would you tell the things you tell yourself, to a little girl you just met? Or a little boy? Tell them they suck, they're worthless, have nothing to look forward to? That they're not good enough. Never was, never will be.

If not, then why is it okay for you to tell yourself those things? Deep down were all just children, children with more exposure.to the harsh realities of life. More experience and more education. Self abuse is still abuse, and It doesn't matter how much you think you deserve it: not every thought that comes to your mind is true, nor is it always fair. Some of us didn't get the luxury of a family that taught us how to deal with these harsh realities, we must be kind to ourselves and not beat ourselves up for things that were beyond our control. 

Please think on this a while. The most important thing you can learn is that, while you hate yourself, you were not always this way. If you were not always this way, then you will not always be that way. But it's up to you to be willing to fight for it. It's impossible to tell how big a storm cloud is  until the storm passes by, and you're in the sun again. Is recovery not something to look forward to? Hell yeah it is"
soc_1695923,socialskills,reddit_comment,830,"&gt;I feel like they think they are being ""nice"" by not being honest with me but all that does is lead me on and make me feel disappointed later. It is far kinder, to be honest with someone and cut ties rather than lead them to think you want to be friends with someone when you don't.

I've been through this with multiple friends and ironically I'm going through this with a girl who supposedly is interested in me but never prioritizes me at all.

I found out with some friends they don't want to be honest with you because they either assume you're sensitive or they project their insecurity on to you. This basically means they're afraid of being rejected and people being honest to them so they assume you must be the same.

It's disgusting how people string us along but then when you do it to them they complain but you are not allowed to do it to them at all.

I'll say yes many people are busy and may not make you a priority. Here's a good tip though if enough time has passed let's say a year and they never found the time you might have never been a friend from the start. 

This is how I feel at least. Reason is:

- I remembered all my friends birthdays they never remembered mine
- I got people who mattered to me gifts I might have gotten a thank you but that's it not even an invite for a coffee
- When they got dumped, there house burned down, they were upset, they were intoxicated I was there for them and they were never burdens to me no matter what I became a burden instantly when I was depressed
- I check up on them often they never even see if I'm alive
- They're always busy but I know they go out
- I was always honest to them they lied
- They were irriplacable to me I was easily expendable
- When I had very little money and one of my friends needed to pay there car so they don't lose there job I gave that money without a second thought. They walked away when I actually needed a friend.
- I respected them and defended them even when they were not around. When I wasn't around they talked smack about me with other's, gossiping, making fun of me I was the joke.

Some came back around some didn't. Some came back and when I brought up the past they ran like cowards (they didn't want to be confronted), some never came back I'm still waiting though.

The point I'm trying to make with my sad life is its up to you what you want to do. You want to give them the benefit of the doubt go ahead they might be busy I won't say they're trashy like my friends who had no respect they might be though.

You want to cut them off do it. You want to sit and wait go ahead wait. People do come back around but here's a tip they'll be extremely embarrassed if they know they were bad friends and are afraid you found out something. 

One of my friends quit his job when he saw my father walking by one day. The reason is hilarious. He was stalking me for years keeping tabs on me to make fun of me with other people behind my back. When my father walked by to go to his job he assumed I sent my father to stalk him (I didn't I wasn't even talking with my father at the time) he was so embarrassed and ashamed he quit his job without telling his boss why (he made up an excuse). He started avoiding the area and me because of all the trash talk he said behind my back when I helped him get a new job, I said good words about him, I was there listening to him when he was upset, I gave him money I didn't have to help him, I was always there for him but he abandoned me and did a lot of bad behind my back.

So this is a reason why one won't come back for me. I found out instantly and  I'm still finding out all the things he said behind my back from others. I had one of our mutual friends bring it up to me a month ago I even know when he said it.

People do come back around eventually. The question is do you want to let them back in? I have two friends (one including the one I mentioned) who I would let back if they did full disclosure and cut the crap this is just how I am full disclosure, honesty, and no more games no lying omitting, or anything else. 

Sorry for the long post but I thought my examples may help hope they do."
soc_1501805,socialskills,reddit_comment,739,"Don't give up on life. 

I can't reply without ending up writing a poorly-written novel that doesn't really make sense, so that's why I usually don't reply.

All I can say is that by making ""making connections"" my main focus, I was making everything harder for myself. I saw awkwardness everywhere, I was so sure everyone thought very little of me, every failed attempt was another rock weighing me down. I focussed only on whether things were going well or not during every interaction: this made me overthink my actions and their reactions, keep silence when I should have tried to share/respond more, look awkward because I was trying too hard. 

Most people aren't apt socially to the point where they can completely change the vibe of an interaction. If I make it awkward, negative or cold from the start, it's hard for most people to make the conversation flow, to redirect the conversation away from self-deprecating jokes or make both of us comfortable enough to have an equal exchange. They feel my vibe, but they aren't able to easily change it. So they walk away instead of bringing themselves down. Which I get. Social interactions are stressful enough, I don't want the other person to make it worse. If the conversation really falls flat for you, it most likely does for them too. The difference is how much importance we give the ""failed conversation"". 

My first real friend, I met when I wasn't even trying. I was waiting for someone else who never showed up and was angry at her for leaving me alone. But I talked to this new person openly, enquired about her, share related experience. I didn't think anything would or even could come out of it, it was just an accident, I wasn't hung up on things going well, so I didn't overthinking. I was myself. Low and behold, we chatted for hours and it only hit me when we stopped. My usual self would have been over-analyzing everything I said and she said to make sure nothing was going wrong, making me less open, more awkward. 

So if I can suggest, don't give up on life. Give up on succeeding to make good connections, but keep trying to connect. Do things you love to do that don't necessarily require other people and, when you get the chance, strike up a conversation with someone. If it doesn't work out, don't focus on that. Forcefully make yourself get back to your activity again and tell yourself you did your best, you can't help what others do, and enjoy the rest of your day. Your plan was to have fun by yourself anyway, so there is no failure. It takes effort, but if you stop yourself whenever you have a negative thoughts about the what ifs and the maybes of an interaction and forcefully replace the thought with something positive (like ""I tried, I can't know why the person walked away, so let's move on"") before trying to focus on something else, eventually, it'll get easier. 

It did for me. It's still hard, but definitely easier than before. 

So don't make friendship or love the goal behind an interaction. Make striking a conversation the goal. That way, you succeed every time. The friendship is a nice bonus.

Practice helps too. Less social exposure for me means more social anxiety, more trouble with redirecting my thoughts away from overthinking. 

We only control our own actions, not other people's and not the outcomes. So it's up to you whether you start conversation or reach out to people. You can share your expectations as well. That's really all we should focus our energy on. 

We can't control others. We can't know what's going on in their heads and we are all biased in a way that makes our perspective on things (including other people's words) unique. It's basically a luck game. You just gotta click with someone (as in, have similar perspectives on interactions) enough on a certain levwl to build a good relationship. Sadly we can't control that, so we can work on being happy doing what we love, being happy with ourselves and letting people see that, so that we'll eventually be able to meet enough people to get to the right kind of people and once we get there, they get to see our true selves, not the layers and walls of coping mechanisms.

""oh, no!""

""that sucks""

Or something similar. This shows that you've understood that they are unhappy.

2. Then follow with up with some details indicating that you know about their life, and the impact of the negative event.

""I know you studied hard for that exam""

Do not present solutions to the problem unless prompted. Do not talk about a time that you had a similar problem.

3. Comforting. This is hard, and it depends on your relationship with the other person, and what your local culture dictates. Food is generally a good option for most negative events except deaths and injuries.

""I know what will cheer you up, let's go get food at xyz""

xyz should be a food-place that the conforted person would enjoy.

""why don't you come over, and I'll make xyz""

xyz should be a food that the comforted person would enjoy

Edit: depending on the local culture, tea, coffee, alcohol, or some other beverage may be an appropriate substitute for food."
soc_824276,socialskills,reddit_comment,330,"You did perfectly. Especially if she really was talking for 90% of the engagement. That means you were asking really engaging and quality questions that caused her to open up and really express herself. The reason you feel like it was an interrogation is probably because she didn't ask *you* any questions.

&amp;nbsp;

When it comes to socialization, a tell tale sign you're a great conversationalist is being able to get people talking about themselves endlessly. It means they're engaged, they interested in sharing about themselves, and chances are they haven't felt able to really do so in a while. It makes you seem warm and welcoming to that person. The thing about it, is though you're doing a great job socially, you've still gotta look at the facts, Ava realize that just because they're opening up to you, doesn't necessarily mean you'll feel good at the end of it.

&amp;nbsp;

You probably want to feel sought after too. And when it comes to conversations, a truly great one has both parties sharing about themselves through quality questions. I don't want to shine a negative light on the girl you were talking to, because perhaps you really were just asking some bomb ass questions. But if she didn't ask you any in return, and strictly stuck to talking about herself, chances are she wasn't too curious or interested about you.

&amp;nbsp;

This doesn't need to be a bad thing. If you were talking just to talk, then again, the fact she was talking so much is good. But if you are interested in her in someway, then while it's cool to take a win socially, take note of the fact she didn't ask you anything about yourself, while you on the other hand asked loads of questions about her. It's pretty obvious you'd want to know a lot about a person you like, right? So why would someone *not* want to ask you a lot of questions? Think about it."

This technique allows you to not think about about what you are doing, and by the time you get to back out, you have already approached them. 

This is a really easy technique here's how to do it. 

1. Find your target of who you want to talk to. 
2. Within 3 seconds of seeing them, start walking to them. 
3. Use all your will power to not stop walking and walk away. Just do it.

soc_1411705,socialskills,reddit_comment,493,"Here's what you can do. Imagine yourself floating out of and above your physical body. Now you are the parent or mentor of your embodied self. What would you tell yourself to do? Maybe you would say, 'those dirty socks on the floor need putting in the laundry'. Or whatever. The point is, you should imagine yourself as your best friend, and eventually become your own best friend. Would you advise your best friend to ignore all of his or her preferences and interests just to accommodate other people? No! It's immoral to do that to your best friend, and it's immoral to do that to yourself. 

I used to be the same way up until my early twenties. Also worth asking yourself is, why do you value other people's opinion of you more highly than your own opinion of yourself? Do you not like yourself, and accept yourself? If you feel unsure about your own self-worth, it may be because you were conditioned to dislike or question yourself, by one or more people. You might want to consider setting boundaries with those people so that there is distance between their comments and yourself.

In fact, I think you would get a lot out of learning some psychology. It will help you to understand yourself and to understand people's motives (benign and malign) and reasons for judging you one way or another.

Best wishes

**Edit: another point worth mentioning. Just because people call you characteristic X does not mean that you are inherently characteristic X.

For example, imagine person A calls person B disgusting. Distusting is an inherent property; it's like temperature or color. That is an incorrect insult because insults can never be objective. Insults (and, likewise, compliments) are always subjective. For every person A who thinks person B is disgusting, there will be some proportion of the world's 7 billion people (persons C) who disagree. The *only thing* that person A can say is, 'person B disgusts me'. See how much power the insult loses when you re-frame it correctly? Your decision in life is to decide how much you care about person A relative to person C, and relative to your own values. (Decide what your values are and which values you want to live by). You will never make everybody happy; there will always be persons A and C.

***If anybody calls you an inherent characteristic insult in the future, consider correcting their speech. Here's a few examples:

*Their insult -&gt; your correction*

You're disgusting -&gt; you are disgusted

You're ugly -&gt; you think I am ugly

You're stupid -&gt; you're claiming I am stupid

You're trampish -&gt; you have a problem with my social class

(Remember that people don't always insult others because they *actually believe* the insult. Some people insult out of jealousy or as negative supply in malignant narcissism. The insult tells you more about the person who insulted you, than it does about yourself)."

soc_510487,socialskills,reddit_comment,278,"It is really hard, I understand but you can't keep evading things in life because fear of rejection...  You probably feel more miserable with regret if you dont ask him and you will never see him again. Rejection is part of life and you need to accept that. The same applies to other things in life, you cant just stop applying for jobs if you get rejected once. It is just more difficult in your situation because you have no prior experience. But that is okay.. In my opinion if you ask him directly yourself and you do it correctly you will show a certain confidence. If you for example relay it to someone else and let a friend ask for you, you maybe give a less confident impression. 

So let's see it from his perspective, a girl asks him for a date. He will only think of one thing, yes or no. And that can be based on a 100 different things, maybe he is already seeing someone, maybe he is not looking for a girlfriend, maybe maybe maybe... He will just give you a straight awnsers and wont think much else of it. You get rejected or you will have a wonderful day. If you don't try you will never know... 

You just have to be really thoughtful and subtle in the way you ask him. You will not sound desperate if you send him a well written text, just be careful with what kind of words you are using.

Because those are two different things...i dont share all my failures  mistakes with people and thats ok because they won't either.

Not sure your age or situation but i think you are thinking about everyone else in a ""grass is greener"" way.  Not getting a job or screwing up in life happens to everyone all the time. Instead of hiding it why not try to use it to connect to someone...rejection, denial and disappointment is really human and you might find a deeper connection with someone in sharing your experience.  

Think about it from another perspective.  If someone told you they screwed up an interview and lost a job...what would you think?  Would you think about how they are a screw up or would you feel empathetic for them?  Might you share your own experience with them? Would you think badly of them or would you feel closer to them because they opened up to you about a personal moment in their life?  

Try not to be so hard on yourself...no ones perfect and anyone who expects you to be is not a good person.

You sound like someone who is very determined and capable and your desire alone to improve is admirable. Most people who are socially inept are content being lonely. You should feel empowered by your decision to improve.

That being said, you need to change your relationship with socialization. If all you see it as is a “chore” to be grinded through that’s all it will ever feel like. Sex is exhausting as hell, but why do people chase after it? Because it CAN be pleasurable. The same goes for social interaction.

It feels exhausting because you don’t seem to have a pleasurable, effort to reward relationship with it. If you take a moment to think about the things you like when it comes to socializing (the feeling of companionship, learning about new people, laughing, having someone to cry with) I believe it will become less daunting and draining.

TLDR: stop treating it like a “chore”. Reevaluate why you want to improve socially. It will always be work, but it doesn’t have to be work you don’t enjoy."

This is what being you has brought to you, there was no other way, this is the path being you leads you through. So it's up to you if you change what you are or you continue this path you have been walking.

About what being non authentic, that means faking something you are not and you don't want to be with certain purpose in mind. if you push yourself to behave and think differently is not being non authentic, it is changing."
soc_1171567,socialskills,reddit_comment,160,"I met a woman last year who is bipolar, she felt a lot like you described. I found out after I met her that she liked me. My friend said that she talks about me a whole lot. I started liking her after getting to know that. But nothing ever came of that since she thought I’d be a burden to her. She was so interested in me! It was crazy, but she somehow decided that it wouldn’t work out, because of her shitty self image. It freaking wrecked me knowing about the hell she was constantly going through. And I felt like shit because she had it in her head that she didn’t deserve to have someone like me. Now, with all due respect I’ve been *exactly* where you are right now. So i get how you feel. But please try not to decide for other people that they deserve better than you. It’s not your call, but theirs."
soc_7756,socialskills,reddit_comment,439,"Hearing about college being great doesn't mean life outside of college isn't, but there are some clear reasons why people look on school days with nostalgia. The thing about college is that you're in a place filled with people of similar age range and social class as you. It makes it easy to find common ground with people. You've all made it through high school and are in the same place taking possibly the same courses, and are in a similar phase of life.

In the world outside of college there are a lot more missed connections. The people you work with will have age ranges of 40 or even 60 years. Some will have children, infants and teenagers, and will likely have different priorities than you - they will worry about saving for retirement and education for their kids while you'll be focused on your school debt among other things. It's not as easy to click, and become overly social, with people 20 years older than you.

You will have to work harder to maintain your friendships, you might not be able to live close or work with the people you want to also hang out with.

Those are some of the drawbacks, but there are a lot of benefits. Being responsible for yourself gives you a good amount of freedom, even though you might have less free time. If you have a good job, you can pay for all those fun activities that you might not have had the cash for when you were younger. You have to find ways to do this, and take advantage of all of this, however.

It is also fun interacting with people much older than you. The larger variety of people you meet will always make your days a bit richer. You'll also have more anecdotes to share with your friends when you do see them.

For myself, I've been a couple of years out of school and I'm enjoying life. I kept close with friends I wanted to keep and see them regularly, though sometimes not for weeks (but that's okay). Part of my enjoyment of life comes from my job, because I like where I work and who I work with. Although I'm dealing with my school debt and have less ""free"" time than I did when in school, I'd say my days now are better.

**TL;DR:** Very few people are going to say that their lives currently are as good as they ""used to be"" in college - nostalgia has a big effect on memory. Whether or not your post-school days are as good is up to you."
soc_792694,socialskills,reddit_comment,209,"First off all, my sincere apologies for having misgendered you. That's my bad. I hope I didn't contribute to making you feel more awkward, because I didn't intend to. I should learn how to read more carefully. 

Secondly, I play in the women's league, so I can't judge whether a guy is attractive. If that's you on the picture, you do look stylish and well-groomed and I can appreciate that. I don't think you look worth of criticizing at all. 

Thirdly... my point stands. I don't care if she's still in love with you, I don't care if you look like a Greek God, I don't care if you don't want to hurt her feelings but you don't mind getting yours hurt... man the fuck up and fix this shit. She's a mad cow anyway and her bullying should not be tolerated. You can continue to feel frustrated, or do something about it. Stop faffing about and either confront her or confront your manager. You do not deserve to be put down like that. You are not an ugly piece of shit. Nobody wants to feel ugly, but you need to make sure she stops acting ugly, because she's not going to start acting like an adult anytime soon."
soc_1630665,socialskills,reddit_comment,254,"I think people instinctively hate it when their parents make their lives *too* soft at whatever age they feel ready to begin maturing &amp; becoming more independent. Because we know, on some level, that if our lives are too safe (because mommy/daddy are ALWAYS there, hovering behind us, preventing us from feeling ANY pain).. we know we'll grow up to be weaker adults.

I had the same problem. I'm not going to tell you to stop feeling annoyed, because I firmly believe it's a parent's job to guide and protect but NOT smother, and to teach healthy boundaries. You obviously feel like your boundaries are not being respected; he's not allowing you the space and distance you need from him.

What I learned is that you can't get him to change. Sure, you can try to have a heart to heart conversation. But my guess is that he'll just feel hurt and that he will not understand. Parents blinded by love and concern don't listen that well.

So instead, accept that he's going to act like this. YOU set your boundaries: you decide when you reply, and how much you say, if anything-- you don't owe him constant or instance conversation; and he's shooting himself in the foot by not letting you come to him when you actually have something to say. YOU get the final say in how you do things.

Accepting him as he is but following your own judgment calls will help to avoid feeling resentful to him down the line."

Wouldn’t have reached that wisdom if she wouldn’t have communicated though. I was just not self aware. Either your bf does it out of spite, or he’s not self aware. If you don’t lift the subject you will never know. Also, confronting him I think would make you stronger and more courageous. It’s up to you, Idk either him or you, do what feels right."
soc_378792,socialskills,reddit_comment,529,"It sounds like you two were closer friends. You counted on him to drive you to a surgical appointment. I think he doesn't care if the other guys make fun of him because they are more like acquaintances, and maybe he only puts up with their bullshit to hang out with you. It also seems like he is more often the butt of the joke, which is mean-spirited, and sometimes, hateful (calling him a homophobic slur.). He might not say it-- because in some Western countries, at least in the U.S., the culture of masculinity dictates that men can only tell their friends they care about each other if everyone is wasted--but he probably considers you a close friend. I think you consider him a close friend, too. I think that's why you feel betrayed (correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm getting this vibe from your post) that he left the party on the night that that girl raped you, because you feel that if your good friend were there, it never would have happened. And you don't consider the other guys (the guys who called your good friend a f**) close friends, because you don't feel as betrayed by them. They didn't intervene, and in hindsight, you didn't expect them to, because they don't look out for you like your good friend does. He has your back, so that's why you asked him to drive you to your surgery. 

I just want to say that I'm really sorry that you had that happen to you. It's not your fault. If you're in the U.S., the National Sexual Assault Hotline is 1-800-656-4673. They also have an online chat at https://hotline.rainn.org/online/terms-of-service.jsp
It might help to talk to someone. I've personally used the chat, and the volunteers were nice. You also don't have to talk to someone if you don't want to either. Whatever you decide is up to you.

I think that what's going on here is not necessarily that your friend is being too sensitive, but that you two have a rift over some hurtful experiences. He might still be upset because you didn't stand up for him when the other guys called him a f**. He might be bringing up stuff from the past because it's still hurtful, and he's expecting an apology, and hoping that by mentioning it, you will pick up on the cues, and apologize. And you're still upset because he wasn't there to take you to your surgery, but also that he wasn't there to watch your back. It's understandable that he would leave when being mocked like that, and it's not his fault that she raped you. It's her fault. There is no way that you or your friend could have foreseen it to prevent it.

I think that your friend cares about you, and it's possible to salvage the friendship, if you guys talk about it. It would be better to talk in person, because it's easy to misconstrue tone in writing. On the phone is the second best form of communication, because you can hear tone, but in-person is best because you can see body language at the same time."
soc_260859,socialskills,reddit_comment,379,"Okay. A lot of things will help you, but I'll try to stick to the situation at hand.

I know you're saying you can't get the idea out of your head that she doesn't want to hang out with you, but you need to. If you wait for her to text first, if you don't invite her out cause you think she doesn't want to, then you're 120% gonna lose her. Thats just a fact. It's a dangerous thing to assume these type of things, when you haven't seen any signs that they might be true. 

If you find it impossible to get out of your head (and please I recommend you at least spend some time and try) then I would ask her. You say she's nice so I bet she wont respond negatively to this. Just be as honest and open as possible about it. ""Hey, sorry for asking you this, but I've been worried that you don't like spending time with me. I really like you as a friend and I've been really concerned about this"". Something like that. If she wonders why you would think that just again be honest and say that you have a habit of being insecure about things sometimes. It's important you make her understand that it has nothing to do with her, so she doesn't feel offended or feels like she has to watch everything she does around you.

As for your friends screw them. If you enjoy your time with her then who cares if the two of you are alone and she has a boyfriend? Good bros would joke about you stealing her, not putting you down. If you're trying to steal her from her bf, then that's up to you, but it doesn't seem that way. Just know what your intentions are and if you only wanna be friends with her, then that's all you need to know. No matter what other people tell you.

As for the compliments I don't quite understand. Are you unsure about the timing? When to do it in a conversation?

And as for with being with her friends, you gotta remember they're not you're friends. Can't mesh with everybody. But I'd keep trying for the sake of being nice to her."

and yes, I’ve dated short guys with and without confidence, it’s never worked with the ones who were insecure because they focused way too much on their height when I simply didn’t give a shit how tall they were. they always felt in competition with every single guy. confident guys know I like them and they’re attractive, so they have no need to feel in competition. 

just my opinion though, of course everyone has their own but as an adult woman I find this sentiment often among other emotionally mature women."
soc_711296,socialskills,reddit_comment,218,"There's no one answer quick fix for this unfortunately.  You don't have to have the same experiences as them to be able to relate to them, but you do have to be able to understand what it's like to be in their shows and what they are feeling. The best I can recommend is to read books and listen to podcasts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Books I'd recommend are personal development ones like **How to Win Friends and Influence people**. Books on emotional intelligence ones are also good. Work on really listening to people and their experiences. Ask them how they make it feel and think about when you've felt the same way in your life.  Listen to podcasts where people talk about their life or personal development. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just because you take things seriously, doesn't mean you need to have a sardonic outlook on life. There's a lot of good in the world and one person can cause a snowball effect to change things. You just have to put yourself out there and see it.  Talk to them about your passions and how they make you feel. If there's anything the other person has that makes them feel that way.  Everyone is more alike and scared of everyone else's judgement too. One you realize that, it frees you a little."
soc_1565070,socialskills,reddit_comment,144,"So then it just comes down to how much you care about the opinions of others. Are you thinking about disagreeing out loud because *you* want to, or because you're too worried about how you seem to others? 

If you do care a lot about others opinions it's up to you to put in the effort to vocalise your thoughts and views - it's not really a waste if you're getting what you want out of it right (making sure people understand your viewpoint). And at that point it's not about you changing minds. Or have a conversation/debate around this topic another time just specifically with the people you care about. 

If you don't care what these people think, and believe that they might agree with the person ranting... Why do you care about making a certain impression? Just move on with your life."

We're not entitled to anyone's friendship or affection and I don't think we should ever really ""force"" ourselves onto anyone else if we can realize that we're doing that. She's already giving you the amount of attention she's willing to give, no sense in anticipating this to change. I would just think of her as a casual acquaintance that you enjoy and I don't see the problem in checking in with her once in a while (to me, this means once every few months to once a year), just would not want you to expect anything to come out of that. You seem like you're really emotionally invested in this relationship but that you are trying to be less so, and I think that's the right thing to do. "
soc_470600,socialskills,reddit_comment,240,"It seems like you're coming from a couple different places here. So the simplest thing to do is just speak up more. I know that's kind of like telling the depressed to get happy, but think about it often. If you're wanting not to be the quiet one you will eventually need to figure out how to talk more. It's up to you to figure out how since we are all unique individuals beings that have different criteria for success, but one of the keys is to not worry about it going badly because it will. Helped me out to realize sometimes I won't click with everyone in the room. Some parties are the best and others I just stood in the corner because when I was talking to people it went poorly. Taught me to watch out for people I want to be around and share the same feeling about me. Pay no attention to people who are petty and don't want to give you the time of day. Same for people who are mean to you, use you, or make you feel bad over things that are petty. Also you have to try talk to people to find these things out; and by talk to them in depth as well. Not approaching anyone, then saying no one likes you is a little bit like saying the soil must be terrible for growing here, when nothing was even planted."
soc_848870,socialskills,reddit_comment,235,"Im totally on the opposite side in this scenario. I get incredibly on edge when I have nowhere to leave my extroverted energy. I live with two introverts and they are not the most talkative people in the world. I acknowledge that everyone is different and they need their time alone but I also get so frustrated when I try to be friendly and open and no one reciprocates. No matter how impersonal it might be, it still feels personal. Because for me this is how I need to stay sane and most of my happiness comes from positive interactions with others. When those interactions are denied I feel as though I am doing something wrong. Of course I don’t want to bother my roommates but sometimes it is hurtful when I try opening up and they don’t seem to acknowledge my presence. It is totally alright to be honest with someone and to set boundaries for yourself. But sometimes you also need to compromise. It is a give and take kind of situation right now since we all have to be home. Have an open conversation and brain storm ways to accommodate both personality types so that both of you can feel understood.

Disclaimer: I am not always trying to talk to them. I understand what space means and I try to ease off sometimes. But it does feel lonely at times.

Good luck!"

soc_1634803,socialskills,reddit_comment,923,"Hey man. I just wish you would take time and read this completely because I feel it's going to be a little long. Firstly, I am sorry for what you are going through and I hope you will find what you are looking for. **Disclaimer: these are just my thoughts, you don't have to accept it, you can just unlike it or delete it even, I dont mind.** And also I am younger than you and I feel like I have my shares of loneliness (no friends I could share my deepest secrets, just friends in names, there are nobody I have nearby that I could share my interests with, I don't hang out with anyone in my own class and I might be like a shadow lol) and I am not saying that I know exactly what you are going through because that doesn't bring justice to what you are going through as I don't know if it is the same as me.

First of all I am not going to give you false hopes saying that it is going to work out if you think that people love you and stuff. But that is a part of it. Just have positive thoughts. And you know how you could be positive? Here's what I figured would kick-start us to be positive. I started to find things that made me curious and exciting, and I work on that. I was lucky to have found out my interest at a young age (I am still young by the way :P lol) and I am intending to take it as my career. I realized this recently as I was really depressed for maybe two months and this week I found something that is in my interest and I started working on it by creating a small goal. I was happy to be able to be consistent with it and working on it. I get excited when I see that I am progressing little by little. Also, I enjoy the working part more than seeing my goal accomplished. But I also know that if I drop this goal at some point, depression will be back in the house. That's why I am trying very careful not to be burnout and try to complete it, so I get an accomplished feeling and use that for the next thing I might be doing. 

I believe that there are many things that as an individual we are interested in it and I don't think that there is a magical destiny for each of us or magical talent that we need to discover inside us blah blah blah. So just give a thought in what you are interested in and try to work in it. It doesn't matter, it can be anything. Painting, dancing, music, instrument, programming, tinkering with gadgets, designing, martial arts etc. etc. And you know what, maybe you might find people who share the same interests as you, and you might hit it really well. Try being curious like a kid and explore - that's what I will say.

Also, another thing I will give a lot of credit to in my life was when I started to meditate. Well it's not when I started, it was maybe a long time after I started, like three months after I started. That's when the effects of my daily-two-times-15minutes-meditation started to kick in. At the beginning I was like ""what is this, will it ever work?"", well I was really convinced when I started to experience the true results. It will take time for some to see the effect of meditation. For some it will be really quick. Fact is, it doesn't matter what the result is, just do it for the sake of doing it. 

Enjoy the path to your destination rather than waiting for the goal to complete to celebrate. Celebrate every day. Who cares if someone ignores me. I like it when I work on the stuff I like 🥳 yay. This is my current state. Me, who was just one week ago, was trying to think I might be alone for my whole life started to think that maybe I will see someone who have same interests as me. **Again, I am not saying that you should accept this as it is, you can just close this comment and move on with something else if you want and just forget what I said, it is completely up to you.** Everyday something good might happen, something bad might happen. It might be the best day some days. It might be the worst day some days that you feel like why go on more. But who cares if it is a bad day, **let it go**, it doesn't matter in the end.

I just said my experiences and my opinions and the way I tried to tackle my loneliness. I might not have tackled my loneliness, but oh well I got at least my parents who do take care of me, and now I am realizing that there were people who have actually cared about me at some point. I don't think I have to try to tackle my loneliness, I think I have to change my attention to something else. Sorry for making it so long, if this helps you in any way I am happy, if it didn't, well maybe someone else might be able to try and help you. I didn't mean to offend you in any way, if you feel like that anywhere."
soc_662333,socialskills,reddit_comment,248,"Hey, man. Let me tell you that kissing someone/ having a relationship isn't the ultimate milestone, as many others have pointed out. As cliche as it sounds, just work on yourself, on your passions as this is what ultimately makes you stand out as a person. I looked on your profile a bit(sorry for stalking :)) ) and saw your Netflix clone. It looks amazing, so why not keep coding if it's what you enjoy? You could also look for other people with the same passions as you and talk to them. It'll be good social practice and who knows, you might also find someone you like.

 I'm not gonna tell you that this ""problem"" of yours will work itself out because it's not always like that, but it's not as  difficult as it seems either. 

 The next time you see a girl you like just try and talk to her and see where that leads you. Try not putting girls on a pedestal, just imagine you were talking to a friend or family member, be yourself and you'll see it'll become much easier. From there, you'll feel when the time has come to go for a kiss.

 You could head over to /r/seduction if you want some tips but I honestly think that talking to someone you like should be something natural, with all the feelings that come with it (even initial awkwardness).

soc_899800,socialskills,reddit_comment,130,"C.S Lewis once said, ""To love is to be vulnerable."" If you want to form meaningful relationships you must love, and risk being hurt. Those are sometimes growing pains in healthy relationships. 


Obviously, knowing whether your introverted or extroverted plays a role in the quandary as well. Extroverts tend to have a several ""good"" friends, while introverts will only have a few. Neither is right or wrong, but simply how it is. For an introvert to try to be an extrovert would be misery, and the reverse is true as well. If you're introverted, then cultivate the few good relationships you have; don't neglect them. If you're extroverted, then obviously you'll have risk being hurt. 


Regardless, ""To love is to be vulnerable"" is a good piece of advice to remember."

soc_252606,socialskills,reddit_comment,682,"I hear you man, and understand, that I am in the same boat. Less so now than I used to be, but let's say 70% of the time, I still feel that way. And sometimes I *will* do nothing, because it's too much, or I'm having trouble understanding what I'm feeling, or I'm sure that I don't need to engage with the pro-social side of myself at that time. Balance is what I'm looking for, as I slowly return the pendulum to a more moderate position.

But remember now we are talking about emotions, which are not in any way *who you are*. Emotions only reflect what is going on in your mind right now, and it's really important to understand them, and really truly feel them. One challenge at the early stages in this journey is realizing which ""feelings"" are entirely natural and which have been exaggerated over time because of your past experiences. Only you know that. Your past experiences are clearly affecting how you act in the moment, and over time we can learn to disconnect that loop, because it is not healthy to be attached to our past constantly, and it doesn't generally help us to react to the past when what is in front of us isn't attached to it at all. I always recommend mindfulness/CBT, because that's what worked for me.

Anyway, my point is, you're already doing it right if you're just noticing your inhibitions, your feelings, the fact that you don't want to engage, or the reasons why you feel shy or anxious. Your goals will always be there in the back of your mind, but if you focus on the goal instead of your awareness, you're effectively saying that you don't want to *learn* about what's happening right now.  You want to get to some future point where everything is the way you want it,  and you want your anxieties and insecurities to disappear.  This is unrealistic. You learn to ""be yourself"" over time by experiencing what it's like to be yourself, by first being whoever you are *right now*, and later being the ""yourself"" that you will be once you have gotten over all of your hurdles. But only aiming toward the end game means you miss out on the hurdles themselves. You repress your emotions and you make them worse over time.

One last thought to consider, why are you trying to talk to girls at clubs? I don't want to generalize, but clubs are extremely shallow places to meet people. The success stories you hear from club and bar situations are really the exception rather than the norm, and I think if you're wanting to practice sociality in a club or bar type environment you're going to be getting a quality of practice that perhaps you don't really need right now. Most of my good female friends (who are admittedly, not ""club goers"") despise crowded social environments like clubs because they constantly are forced to engage with people who are either trying very hard to make a connection or are very difficult to understand through their layers of confusing (ie ""mysterious"") social behavior. But a lot of people feel they have to be ""on guard"" at places like clubs, and thus they're not really ideal social partners, especially if you have insecurities.

Anyway, you obviously know what is best for you, which is why I initially recommended you discard advice that only makes you think more about ideas, and that includes a lot of what I have said, but the point that I want to reiterate (or rephrase) is that understanding sociality gets you nowhere. Understanding yourself is a key goal. Nobody ever knows themselves as well as they think they do, which is why it is important to observe, without judgement,  without expectation, without beating yourself up for making mistakes. The more you know about yourself and your feelings, the more you will see how your ""self"" is a lot more malleable, your quirks a little more fun, and your interactions a lot more meaningful than you initially imagined."

e.g. See someone else you'd like to speak with? ""Oh, hey! My old friend ____ is here, I wonder what they're up to. I'll go say 'hi', catch up with you later?"" It's reasonable reason to leave but reaffirms that they are worthwhile *and* that you're interested in further conversation.

*Note:* You don't want to leave in a hurry. You could even lead up to leaving by having a conversation related to what you're leaving to do. ""I think I may go get a drink... by the way, were you there at so-and-so's party with that failed keg stand?""

*Additional Note:* Leave on a high note. If you leave when conversation lulls, they'll think you're ditching them. Leave 'em wanting more. **(This part took me way too long to figure out.)**"
soc_1343598,socialskills,reddit_comment,407,"Yes but lol

So thats something I feel the need to do periodically. Just mute my phone, toss it in a corner, n take a day or two to myself. And I’m %100 allowed ethically/morally to do so! Its my time n energy n attention n my call on how to spend it! 

But other ppl are also %100 entitled to having their own experiences and feelings about me ghosting. Ofc plenty of ppl are gonna get worried when they can’t get ahold of me without explanation. And when its ppl I already know for a fact are gonna have that experience? 

I can either give em a heads up before the fact, make the effort to respond to at least them at least minimally during as a “my feelings are not MORE important than theirs, just equally valid, n this ain’t a zero sum game so there IS a healthy median where maybe I don’t get QUITE as much TOTAL me-time as I really want and they don’t get QUITE as much engagement as they do but I at least don’t totally disregard EITHER of our feelings.”

OR I can make the call that, for whatever reason with whatever happens to be goin on, my ppl need me more than I need a break rn n decide that my me-time is gonna not be rn even if I want it to be cuz theres sumthin or someone else that I consider a higher priority or higher stakes atm.

OR I can decide that this is what I need rnand I’m ALLOWED to make a selfish call atm... so long as I’m conscious of what I’m doing n willing to acknowledge and even apologize to those I’m knowingly hurting after the fact.

Depending on the day and the curcumstances, I may well do any of the above and/or some combination thereof. The point, to me, being that you do not need to consider your feelings or someone else’s “right” and that both can be treated as equally valid and you can thenjust make your own informed decision about how you’re gonna handle that rn based onyour own values. And apologizing for causing someone hurt isn’t saying that your needs were wrong or the decision you made wasn’t the rightone at the time. Its just acknowledging that you don’t exist in a vacuum and actions have consequences and other ppl have feelings that (hopefully) matter to you too."
soc_438404,socialskills,reddit_comment,291,"Hi there, i was in the same situation as you are right now. Here are a few things which might help you:

Books- read ""no more mr nice guy"" and ""the subtle art of not giving a f*ck"". Other self help booka might help you aswell.

Practice- it can be hard talking to girls (i know, i went to a highschool with 99% male students plz dont ask). Thats why you should start practicing. Don't walk up to a random girl yet! Try approaching a girl with who you CAN'T be in a romantic relationship (maybe a classmate who has a relationship). Try to get to know this girl, as a friend. And be honest! Act like yourself. When you get comfortable, try becoming friends with other girls.

Porn- if you watch porn, give yourself a break. r/Nofap can be useful. However start smal, like 3 days up to a week.

Exercise- try to have some physical activity, like running, jogging cycling. Weightlifting is a must (get a gymmembership or if thats out of your budget, a few weights of your own like dumbbells).

Style- this one is up to you! Decide how you want to be perceived, however i advice you to watch some youtube channels focused on male style (alpha m, teachingmenfashion and real men real style). About the hair: don't cut it yet! Choose a haircut wisely (with your faceshape etc).

Mindset- stop looking at others, look at yourself! Make sure what you want and how you want to achieve this (goals). Measure and analyse yourself, where did you start, where are you now and where do you wanna be!

Don't stereotype yourself (read about the barnum effect).

You can message me bro if you want, good luck!"
soc_1051298,socialskills,reddit_comment,108,"She might have been using you. She definitely needed a pickmeup and that’s why she told you to come over. If she liked you more, she would’ve fucked you or told you more about why she was sad. The fact that she didn’t do either or one of these things means she probably wanted to keep her distance. The only way to really tell if she was using you is to keep texting her and hit her up in the future. If she only wants to hangout when she’s sad then she’s using you. Whether it’s worth the effort or not to find out is up to you"
soc_576931,socialskills,reddit_comment,216,"wow that must make you feel horrible. i totally know the feeling.

if you feel you can confide in your one close friend that has included you, talk to her about how you’re feeling and ask her if there really is anything going on. i would say that maybe they’re still warming up to you, BUT it’s different because you’re actually putting effort to hangout with them and they seem to not really care. so strange to me how people can be sometimes lol.

I would suggest, from experience, is to hold onto the ones that make you feel special and put effort into your friendships (your one friend who has included you, your friends from out of state) and maybe try branching out. you don’t have to completely drop that group of girls, but it could be helpful if you weren’t worrying about this mistreatment and focusing on meeting new people. it will definitely be hard at first but you’ll find a way! i know the fear of not having any friends, but it’s honestly better to be independent and searching for new friends rather than trying to squeeze yourself in their group when they’ve given you signs of not caring to include you, and you don’t deserve that /: girls can be really mean "
soc_470334,socialskills,reddit_comment,303,"I'm going to talk from my perspective as a girl who also has issues with socializing, for a second. 

If you were to strike up a conversation with me - and by that, I mean even a ""hi"" would do - I'd be so happy. It would make my day. Since you mentioned how your classmates are like (or at least seem like) you, I'm sure they'd be happy as well. It's a relief when someone comes up to you and starts a conversation. And if the girl wants to keep it going, she will. Even if she doesn't know how, she will seem interested. She will keep looking at you, be around you, ask questions etc. For others who don't seem interested, try your best still. But don't get disappointed if it doesn't work out. You want to find someone who is interested in *you*. 

Whether you want to make friends with a girl or think of something more, I think the beginning is pretty much the same. 

I like to talk to guys more, like you do with girls; because I feel more comfortable. Guys tend to be kinder and girls... Well there are a lot of risks, socially.  And hey, there may be girls like that in your class/school as well.

I think in this case, you gotta talk to as much people as you can. I know it sucks, especially if you have a hard time socializing. But you can't achieve what you want any other way. I haven't found a way to make it less difficult, more fun, more easy on my anxious system. I really could use some tactics on how to make the socializing process easier. Especially making friends. So if you (OP or any reader) have any idea that works for you, please write it."
soc_409709,socialskills,reddit_comment,295,"See here's the funny part... I do understand you, you don't understand yourself. While you may think it's strange, it isn't. Your definition of the word ""strange"" is not the same as mine. Is quantum tunneling strange? How about consciousness? Photosynthesis? How much do you know about the world, humanity, life, the cosmos and the underlying, unimaginably complex and weird characteristics of this universe we find ourselves in?

Strange... you don't have a clue.

However, you certainly have every right to make your own choices and strive to improve yourself. All I am saying is you don't have to. Honestly, billions of people out there are jerks. Those people who you think aren't... yeah they are lying. Human beings are incredibly self centered. It takes hard work and continual effort to be nice.

You can be happy being whatever you think you are, but I guarantee you that no matter how hard you try to be whatever you aspire to be, plenty of people will still think you are a jerk anyway.

So, I am not giving you advice on what to be. I'm telling you the reality of the situation. IT DOES NOT MATTER.

There is everything wrong with being proud of yourself. That is the worst kind of pride. You simply choose not to believe it. This is not my opinion. History stands beside this assertion. Nothing, NOTHING, has ever come out well when pride is involved. I mean unless you think genocide, oppression, and civil unrest is good?

Don't believe me, I don't care. Go be proud. See that how that works out for ya. Get back to me in 20 years. Just don't say I didn't warn you.

soc_545456,socialskills,reddit_comment,353,"I have had some decent luck with OKCupid. It's not just a dating site and in your profile you can specify exactly what you're looking for in regards to platonic/romantic/sexual connections. You can look for all three with your profile, or just platonic friends.

Depending on what part of the world you're living in, you could have really poor luck with OKC, or great luck. I met more connections through it in California and Colorado for instance, than I did in either Hawaii or the east coast US. But I'd suggest give it a shot.


Also, looking through ads on Craigslist for events in your community can offer a lot of opportunities, especially if it's volunteer related or group oriented. You're more likely to get people coming up to you for interaction rather than having the pressure on you, if it's something that requires communication to participate in.


Taking a class of some sort like at a community college, can be a great place to meet people, especially if it's something you're super into or knowledgeable about. That way you might feel more confident about speaking up in discussions.


Also, speed dating. It's a terrible way to meet people from my experience, but what it does is at least give you a chance to exercise your social skills, and you're probably bound to meet people who are more awkward at social interaction than you might be.


My best piece of advice is don't try to go into a situation feeling like you have to come out of it with a new friend or partner on the other end or else you failed. Approach each experience as just that, a new life experience. Concentrate on relaxing and engaging with whatever falls in front of you. Don't force yourself to be social and find a connection, but just show up and be present and if you have something to say that engages a conversation, great! If not, go home knowing you can try again another day so you stress on failing less. If you keep making attempts in new ways without forcing it, it'll happen."
soc_43474,socialskills,reddit_comment,278,"We focus on the right words because the words we choose, influence a person's perception of our intelligence, as well as make up a great deal of actual communication. All that I meant was that if I walk up to you confidently and exude confidence then when we start talking you assume I am confident. From that point the right words can either make or break this reality. The same is true for walking away, if I still appear confident as I walk away then the assumption is that it was not an act. 

Socially I am an interesting person, I've never had trouble with making friends, holding conversations, or choosing my words. My confidence issues stem more from a self image problem than a socializing problem. But honestly I am doing well, and I've realized a small level of social increase as I became more confident. 

My methods have changed millions of times, I'm a software engineer by trade so trial and error as well as continuous improvement are simply a part of who I am and what I do. I presented this method because honestly while it was nice to hide behind my computer screen and experience little lessons in self image and even smaller victories, I had an event a few years back that made me realize that confidence and social skill are simply not things that can change physically when I worked on them virtually.

Tl;dr: Diction is important once you make the right first impression. I'm fixing me for me and no one else do socially there is little benefit for me. Methods change as our environment changes and our experiences shape us. "

We enjoy the mild absurdity of it. 

It doesn't work that well for emotionally charged topics, but breaching those is easier after we've connected intellectually. Maybe just jump into right into the middle of taking about something you're both passionate about and take it from there once you're already connecting? I admit I'm not a very skilled conversationalist, but I do find a direct, if somewhat inelegant approach works better for me than dancing on the safe edges inoffensively.

soc_245858,socialskills,reddit_comment,825,"Hi

Maybe I can give you some positive perspective on your situation, though I am much younger than you (21), I have dealt with maybe a bit of a similar situation last year or so. 

First off I will share my story up till now and maybe you'll find some clues for yourself. Last year at the start of the summer my longtime girlfriend broke up with me. She was my first serious love and although I always thought of myself as a quite a self-sufficient guy, it turned out to be not entirely true. Over the course of 2 years I became quite dependent on her for my happiness. She was like a drug in a way for me. After the break-up I realised I needed to pick myself back up and figure out a way to be able to be happy on my own. This is where I think my experience can connect with yours. You say you are having trouble trusting people and are tired of being rejected? Well, that was somewhat my experience too after the breakup, I became somewhat of a recluse. After a year has gone by though I think I grew a lot, because I learned what makes me happy and I feel like now I'm taking steps into becoming a much more sociable person than I ever was before. The key to becoming sociable for me was that of being a social recluse for a year though. Also it's not enough to just isolate yourself from the rest of the world, the goal is to read/train/learn and whatever feels right to you that is going to make you happy one day. Somewhere this summer, a couple of weeks ago I realised I was again a much happier person, dare I say even happier than before the breakup.

I hope this story helps you to see things in a bit of a different light. You're not hopeless, cause nobody is. You may be unhappy right now, but that can change, if you just keep doing what feels right, odds are somewhere along the line you won't have to force yourself to get out of bed each morning but you'll actually look forward to it. When that happens I think you'll also see the good in the people, and however hippie this may sound, I truly believe that whenever you radiate positive vibes, you'll see you're not the only one and there are lots of people who you can befriend.

Last but not least I'll give you some pointers to what helped me getting over the slum, these are in no particular order, it's just some stuff that from time to time helped me get through some rough patches.

* **Running** : I started doing this a lot since it helped me each day to clear out the fog in my head.
* **Fitness**: Obviously
* **Playing guitar** : I used to get really lonely in the evenings, my guitar helped me through a lot of nights that could've turned out to be very depressing outherwise.
* **Watch Charisma on Command** : this channel gave me some insight into being a more sociable person, I would especially recommend the latter videos. The one about magnetic mindsets and self love really resonated with me.
* **read The Undefeatable Mind** : The first of my book recomendations, it talks how people are able to deal with difficult situations and keep going. I guarantee you that some of the stories will resonate with you and you'll be able to develop some of the better mindsets that'll set you up for more happy living.
* **read Into The Wild** : this book really helped me understand I wasn't the only one who is going through a bit of a quest to truth and happiness. It also helped me realise that travelling alone is an option and can be an even greater experience than in a group. It inspired me to go on a surfing camp in Portugal without any friends, by myself. This was a week ago and it was there I realised how much I changed, I made lots of friends in one week, something I wouldn't have been able to do a year ago. I also used to be grumpy because I always felt like there wasn't any group of people I can fit in with easily, now I realised there are indeed people with the same views on life as me. Now I'm studying for some exams I didn't pass during the semester, but the thought of there being some people similar to me keeps me going. 

Next year I think I'm gonna be a way more positive and sociable person, so I'll see how my story goes on. I think the (temporary) bad part is over for now, I'm enjoying the good part of life now. 

Hopefully this will inspire you to keep marching forward (in the right direction!)

soc_1600244,socialskills,reddit_comment,243,"first thing first: loss of old self is often a warning sign of depression. time to check in with your doctor or your work's EAP if either of those are options and you haven't tried them already.

second thing second: as far as I can make out, being interest*ing* is generally a combination of a) being interest*ed* in stuff (which gives you material to play on) and b) understanding what parts of the stuff you're interested in will be interesting to other people (which makes the material you're playing on compelling). 

so, what things are you interested in, and how can you engage more with them? thinking about the groups you spend time with, what things are they interested in, and how can you engage more with those things? engagement can be passive (listening to podcasts, browsing subreddits, or whatever) or active (going dancing or kayaking or making music, or whatever).

third thing third: being *fun* is slightly different from being *interesting*. I'm trying to work this out as I type it, so this is a loosely held idea: I think being fun is to do with prioritising enjoyment over safety. it means making jokes without worrying about exactly how they'll land, or proposing activities without worrying about exactly how they'll turn out. I reckon this is partly why depression is such a fun-killer: depression makes you assume everything will turn out badly, so you don't bother to try, if that makes sense?"
soc_1779631,socialskills,reddit_comment,141,I think you are really mature to look for answers to your dilemmas in your relationship so first of all props.  I think he’s dating someone that’s willing to look at themselves also and that makes him a lucky man.   If he’s smoking away from you to respect you that’s him compromising. But if you want him to change just because you are that’s not his responsibility and you have to focus on yourself and if him having his own ideas on life and how he chooses to live becomes too much to handle then perhaps your not in a happy relationship. The positive angle tho is he understands and respects your decision and he respects himself and his choices and you two can grow together with patience and learn how not to be emotional when things don’t go your way.
soc_1730397,socialskills,reddit_comment,435,"Well for one, you have to be aware that things look way better on the outside than what they look on the inside. You percieve people getting very happy about getting multiple texts but you actually don't know what that person is thinking or what their relationship is like. Maybe they've been friends with these people since childhood and so, it's more like family talking to each other, or maybe they're coworkers or are working on something together. Point is, there are many reasons for why people text each other and it doesn't stem from a person just being interesting. Hell, maybe they are only constantly texting each other because they need something from the other person constantly. 

So what do people text that's so interesting? One thing is common interest. What's something you like that the other person likes? That sparks great conversation. Or just talking about how your day is going. Another thing (this is for people who are very close) is stuff that people are struggling on or things people have anxiety about.If you want to have a good conversation with someone, don't try to force topics, just ask open ended questions and let the conversation flow (also let them know that you're an awkward person if you want, I know it may seem like people will push you away if you say that, but a lot of people are actually understandable. I'll leave it up to you to know when you want to tell someone that.)

For the part where you say that people want to end conversations with you as soon as possible. There's a high likely chance that this is your anxiety talking and that the other person probably doesn't want to end the conversation fast (unless they're busy, in a foul mood, or dying). Nothing further to elaborate, you're probably wrong about people wanting to end conversations with you fast, it's usually anxiety talking. I know from a LOT of personal experience (I can elaborate if you want me to).

How can you change yourself in a better way? First, recognize that you're not a boring or uninteresting person. That's the first hurdle  you have to overcome. If you believe you're something you're more likely to act like that something, even when you're clearly not. It's like someone believing they're a wolf, where they will act like a wolf when they're not. Same thing with being boring and uninteresting. Everyone has a story and we're all unique in our own ways, no human is inherently boring or uninteresting. So don't say you're boring or uninteresting, cause that's wrong."
soc_252215,socialskills,reddit_comment,308,"My friends were convinced that eating late is bad for you, as whatever you eat is stored in your body. I refuted by saying it depends on your level of activity throughout the day (eating more carbs before a workout), and the amount of calories you intake during the day. But then they argued that your metabolism decreased during sleep so eating that late is not good. However, studies has shown that that doesn't matter as having adequate hours of sleep should still help digesting the food. Another friend joined the conversation later and he said the same thing I presented earlier. They believed him and said ""that makes sense"". 

Another example is I had with my girlfriend. She's in sales, and her package says that if you don't sell x amount in a month, you only get paid 75% of your promised salary. She told me how her contract states that, and we found out that she can move to another sales plan and get paid 100% regardless of how much she sells. Her manager is not helping, so I told her to speak to HR and discuss with them how she can change it, and get her manager in the meeting. There were a lot of terms on how to describe her role and the different packages, so I gave her the information she needs to know to speak to HR. She replied by saying no but her manager is not helpful, and she wasn't convinced. When she came back after speaking to a colleague a few days later, she said she will have a meeting with HR and her manager. She told me what her colleague said, and it was the same thing I've said.

Lots of people find little in common with friends from youth/childhood. Relationships change as we change, for better and worse. That being said, the older I get the more I realize how valuable friendships are - new and old. I try to maintain old friendships but also welcome new ones. The friends I’ve made in my late twenties I absolutely cherish because I have more in common with them or we connect on a deeper level.  But most of those friendships came from me stepping out of my comfort zone (i.e. joining a trivia group, ceramics studio, volleyball club, etc.) Whatever interests you is a great place to start and that might help you find likeminded people who you can go out with and enjoy life with. 

Also, I know a lot of people feel the way you do on this, but doing things alone doesn’t have to be depressing. It can be really liberating and fun. I started traveling alone when I was your age and I found it to be a really great way to meet people since you have a more open energy than when traveling with others. It also gave me a lot of confidence and I found that I enjoy being alone, as well as with friends. 

Just do what feels right to you. No matter your age, just go places that sound fun, try new things, make new friends...some things/people won’t be a great fit, and other things/people will inspire you and instantly feel right. Have fun and enjoy the journey!"

If a friend is genuinly wanting to offer what you need (you need to be clear what kind of support you want; listening ear, advice, or help), they chose and made the decision, you don't need to worry because they're their own person too. 

Though, sometimes people want to be nice yet for some reason don't actually want to help. That's on them which makes no sense, if someone tries to blame you for something, ignore it, they need to set their own boundaries next time and be clear."

I lacked a lot of positive socialization coming up.i spent alot of time trying to fit in and doing whatever I could to avoid being bullied. I was jaded by rejection so I believed the whole ""women don't want nice guys"" so I used my hurt to just be a dick to women. Made them feel as low as I felt they made me feel. Just real limited world view thinking. I hate the idea that who I am now is much more mature, married, would never treat a potential mate how I used to but the old me is the only person they know. I could have probably had all the things I covet now back then if I had been who I am know back then. My social skills, my understanding, my world view have all gotten better but now that I'm married it isn't like I can do alot with it in that department. My only viable option is that I can help my child not do the things I did. However I do think about how my life would've turned out had ""I had a better brain"" back then

I wish I hadnt spent most of and still do my life thinking that I'm this gargoyle looking guy even though I'd personally say I'm a solid 6. I wish that I could have had actual conversations and connections instead of worrying that I failed if they wouldnt have sex with me, I wish I didn't think I was worthy of physically attractive women for so long (""She would never date a guy like me. She's too good looking for me. I need to find someone more my speed), I wish I didn't spend so many years petrified to wear glasses over trauma of school.

From several others servers i've heard that there's a rule, simply that you don't ask someone out directly. Servers are doing their job, they need to stay professional and really aren't fond of being asked out like that. It should be more subtle. However i am of the opinion that everyone is different and this girl might actually like to be asked out like that. Kind of like...''It's nice to see you again, and i was wondering if i could buy you a drink sometime.'' But a note or napkin isn't that bad of an idea neither."

Do we have a good time when we hang out? Again, yes. And they can count on me, too. That's all I need. Good friends are good friends, it doesn't matter if they feel like they need to rank friendships. Personnally I don't, everyone is different and you don't bond with everyone over the same things.

You don't have to be ""interesting"" or ""super fun"" to be good company. I like most of my friends for their good hearts or because we share values or views on things we care about in life. We don't necessarly share tastes in music or concerts or whatever. Being different is ok.

Just try and enjoy being around people you like. Enventually you'll open up to a few of them and they'll do the same. Frienship takes time, but it's worth it."
soc_1357094,socialskills,reddit_comment,213,"Hmm maybe you could joke about the school you went to if you’re comfortable with that. I’m not sure what “bad” school means in your area but it could go something like this: 
other person:“what school did you go to?”
You: “I went to ____, I don’t worry much less people get stabbed than you’d think” (idk how on par this joke is for the schools where you are or how offensive/hurtful it could be, but it’s what I used (I was in a similar situation) and people were much more open)
I think they might just be recoiling because going to that specific school where all the other people went as well is a good conversation starter and most likely their go to, so when they hear you’re not from there it’s probably a little different (or maybe they’re asshole Idk), but either way I’m sure they’ll warm up to you as you become a familiar face in class. Plus Im just estimating that not all of the people in your program will have the same view point on not befriending someone from a “bad”school, there’s bound to be at least one person who doesn’t think like that. 
I feel like this was all over the place I hope this was helpful"
soc_803174,socialskills,reddit_comment,107,"I am currently in the same situation as you, I'm a guy and I've come to realize how infatuated I've become with an older female coworker of mine. She's very funny, very sweet, and the only other person who I actually feel like they want to talk to me. However as I said she is older then I am by some years and I always have such a hard time keeping up casual conversation because of my social awkwardness and the fact that I feel like every other sentence out of my mouth will end up embarrassing myself. The struggle is real and I understand your pain."
soc_1681735,socialskills,reddit_comment,1224,"Step one: self acceptance. Being a quiet one is not a negative trait. If people are telling you that you are a quiet one, then they're just being observant. What do they mean, what do they want from you? What actions inline with your values can you take to ease them? Such commentary is just observations, not labels. This does not mean you are a quiet person unless you believe you are a quiet person. And if you believe you are a quiet person, then this is not an insult, this is just people calling out exactly what they see. It isn't good or a bad thing. Get that striaght. Truly understand this. Accepting who you are and where you are is key.  
 
You are currently quiet, and are working on your social skills. Dems the facts. These are good things. You don't need to be talkative for people to like you. 
 
Step two: see others as your equal. You're not trying to make friendships out of others any more than they are with you. They don't have anything over or under you. Everyone around you is your school mate. You're on the same team. It's okay to be awkward, they are also awkward! 
If you feel you can't talk to someone because of social stature, understand you're making that up in your head. Imagine the coolest kid in highschool. Now take them out of the school and out them on jury duty with you. Are they still on this petistool in this different environment? Hell no, they're the same level as you.  
  
Step three: introduce yourself. You've gone a year without people even knowing who you are properly. Just say, ""I've never properly introduced myself to you, I'm so n so..."".  
Do that with fkn everyone. Get good at introducing yourself. Probably the best skill when meeting new ppl, and especially great when you forget ppl's names.   
  
Step four: Drop the pity party. In highschool you don't have to be ashamed of what you want. You've probably learned from your parents that telling others what you want will results in a reaction you dislike. News flash, nothing is good or bad. Only you decide that. In reality, we don't know how everything in the universe is connected. Imagine this, you tripping over a rock in front of 20 people and having them laugh. How embarrassing, however, you might have just saved 200 babies on the other side of the planet. Everyone literally was thrown on earth and literally just made up a bunch of rules everyone goes along with until one or a lot of people stop and say ""hey, maybe this rule isn't good or could be better"". Anyway, I typed all this to say that everything you do by just being you is actually important to the world. Every decision is the right one. Telling people striaght up what you want saves them a lot of time from fkn mind games. ""Hey, I want to be your friend"" is not such a crazy thing to say, especially since it's obvious that 80% of people in your school are looking for the same thing. They just all came up with different fake rules on how to approach it in their heads. You don't need to play their games, approach it how you want to. And drop the pity party, if you feel sad that you don't have friends, that sadness is not a bad feeling. It's a good thing. It's necessary for you to be in tune with these things. It's just yourself telling you to start living and avoid these fears of hurt or embarrasment. If you just pity yourself, you're avoiding the uncomfortable work your body is informing you to do. 
 
Be true to yourself and you'll be rewarded by the universe. Every gut feeling you have which your brain says, ""hey hey hey, don't do that"" just fkn try it. Do the fkn opposite until you can make actual smarter decisions backed by wisdom from more than one negative result. Yeah we learn to not touch a stove once from a burn, but some people always think the stove is on. Even if you fuck up so badly, it doesn't matter. We don't even know about death. So everything you do is a net positive if you're being true to yourself. 
  
The only proof in this fkn world that you're expressing your own freedoms and living your life for you, and not for others (which actually makes you more friends) is that people dislike you.  
Every fkn opinion and thought that someone has, there will be someone who disagrees, and that's great! It means you can think for your damn self. Someone may not like how you look, great! That means the opposite is true too. Every single thing has an opposite and equal force. If someone calls you ugly, it means that someone thinks you're handsome. That's just the laws as we know it so far in the universe. And even that is up for change in the future... But I digress. That's how it currently is. Take pride in that.   
   
Conclusion: if you want to be liked, be comfortable with not being liked. Start liking yourself. Then introduce yourself. Allow silent awkward moments, it's not your job to be a clown and fill in the blanks, be comfortable with your own skin. That's shit is cool, people like people who are comfortable with themselves. You don't need any brovado to be cool. You just have to look at everyone around you as your teammates and not better than you. Same goes with your teachers and principals. Outside of school they're on the same level as you. If you don't believe that, then go deeper, Outside of the country, they're exactly the same. Outside the continent. Outside the planet. We're all fkn ants. Believe that shit. Avoid looking up or down on people. Give everyone the respect you'd give yourself. Even if you don't love yourself, give others the same respect. See how quickly you'll have to start changing how you view yourself to treat others better.   
Even that is cool.   
  
This isn't a competition. Earth IRL is a co-op game. Step outside yourself for a second and see you're apart of the bigger picture and the game of life. All your actions, even this post has helped push humanity to the future. Forreal. Thank for reaching out for help and inspiring everyone in this thread to open themselves up to you and share what they believe is right. Now get out there and start telling people you want to be their friends, and give them an action they can do right away. ""hang out with me here"", ""give me your number"", ""play this game with me"".  
  
Ps: Some actionable request with your honestly goes a long way, cuz tbh, someone just saying, ""hey I wanna be your friend"" could mean fkn anything. Are they hitting on me? It helps ease minds when you know exactly wtf someone even wants you to do with that information. Just like how you feel when someone tells you that you're quiet. ""Okay, well, wtf do you want me to do about it, are you asking me to speak with you more? About fkn what, what was the purpose of your comment?!?!"""
soc_1332765,socialskills,reddit_comment,108,"Atheist here.

In my opinion it is completely fine to ask people, if they want to pray with you. If someone asked me, I would decline respectfully. I would not feel pressured in any way. I would likely wait for you to have done your prayers before eating, as a basic form of respect for you as a person, not for your faith. I might not share your belief, but I can still respect your decision to follow that belief.

But then again, I'm a strong willed person, that is not afraid to say no, I rarely feel social pressure, even if people are trying to pressure me."
soc_851295,socialskills,reddit_comment,149,"""I'm sick of people apologizing for not responding sooner. Should I treat them worse then?"" Yikes

You are allowed to apologise for things simple because you feel bad for something. It shows consideration for what the other person MIGHT be feeling.

""I'm sorry you're having a bad day""
""Hey, sorry I missed your call""

I hope you're just frustrated and not actually thinking apologies need to be for things that are bad. I understand that frustration, expectations and such can be weird to navigate. People typically like those who respond quicker for a variety of reasons. You might seem more reliable to get a hold of or more dedicated/interested, or that person might just be more highly strung or lonely and want someone to talk to. I don't think I'd be happy with an SO that I had no idea when or if they'd respond to me that day."
soc_770779,socialskills,reddit_comment,780,"Hmm...   Zero game...  Might be a problem.
I'd suggest Good Looking Loser's site, approach anxiety exercises. 
It's not really about approach anxiety, but experience talking. Get used to saying things just because it's too quiet, for example. 

I can sympathize, I'm a quiet one, too. Though I've found I can pull out of my league (4'8.75"" - that .75 matters, dammit!; 245 pounds, over 30% body fat, but I'm told I look good. And the girls respond. Not 10s, but I'm also not in night clubs, I'm in daily life, and they flirt with me, so my I come doesn't matter, even though I earn well. I don't wear a Rolex, or drive a Porsche, or wear a suit, there are no signs of wealth, so it's all personality. And I have haters, too, though I don't know why. )

You may be a bit young for things like talking to the barista while you get coffee, but you can turn the concept, talk to a girl at school, and for that matter guys at school, same as the exercises go. Talk to the teachers. Talk to people on the bus or train, if you're on public transport. Ask about the book someone is reading. What it's about, why they chose it, if it's business, learn about business by asking questions. (Getting to the advanced levels already, but the idea is to remember to open your mouth, a little more each day.)

Pick Up Artist stuff is gold for this. You don't need to play the games, but you'll want to know the ideas, and use the exercises, because it also helps with business, life, deals and negotiations, communications... And much of what is said is actually non-verbal. So it's defensive as well, you learn who is a shark and why, and how they give themselves away, and you can manage the Art of the Deal, or your child's school principle...  E.g., show up in overalls and a straw hat, it sends a message. A fitted suit and briefcase, with a Rolex sticking out? Sends a message.
Which one is likely to scare the principal if he says ""lawsuit?""
Which one is real? Maybe neither, maybe both are correct in different circumstances, but you want to know which is which when you see them. The guy in the overalls and work boots and a tie-dye shirt, is different from the guy in overalls, worn and dirty work boots, and a shirt rolled up to the elbows. The second likely has callouses on his hands and a grip like a vice, but if you're not in farm country... 😉 The callouses aren't likely to exist. 

If you're in Chicago, be careful wearing Bulls merchandise, though Bloods and Crips may have changed their attire, I'm going on memory here.
You don't want to be mistaken for the wrong group...   But if you look like an out of place white boy, you may get a pass, for example. (Three blocks the other way, being white, it wouldn't matter what you wear, you won't come home.)

Went to school in Newark, NJ, and Washington, DC. Chicago is used for clear social groups, but is over simplified. Fast talker may be able to get leeway, if you're not able to talk and think quickly, you can be at risk.
So this is training for life, and the whole PUA realm allows you greater success in life, when you take the principles and run with them. 
Mike Cernovich, Roissy, Roosh V, Paul Elam (not a PUA, runs ""A voice for men"" site), Married Man Sex Life blog (if it still exists), there are lots of options, all with different objectives and ideas, revolving around the same basic reality we live in. 
You'll have to see what is applicable, it won't all be useful or apply to any given situation, but knowing more about how people think and perceive and react, and the messages you are sending both verbally and non-verbally, will take you far in life. I know people who got hired for mimicking their interviewers....  Nice to land a $100,000 / year position, off the boat from China, fresh out of college, sort of thing. (He was a foreign students graduated from one of our unis back in the early 80s or so, went to work for NASA.)

This is all about how to do it 
What to say, when it comes to conversation, is still on you. But you want to be noticed and active socially, you'll never get that chance again. Learn the skills, land the jobs, promotions, women, and make life what you want. 
Or you'll be overlooked most of your life."
soc_432187,socialskills,reddit_comment,436,"This is what I'm doing right now:

Approach 10 people every day for 30 days.

Start out light, just say ""Hi"", ""Hi, how are you"" or ""Where's this or that"". I doesn't matter if you talk with them, it's the approaching that often is the first step.


After a couple of days (when you feel ready, but DON'T wait too long) you can try something like:

""Hi, I really need a female perspective one something, what do you think about this shirt on me?"" 

or the one I tried yesterday 

""Hi, this is quite the strange questions but I'm doing this workshop that defines self image, and one of the tasks is to ask females what image I project, so, please tell me.""

I actually was so nervous I'm not sure if that's exactly what I said but you get the point. And it's very important that what you're saying is true. Personally I AM doing that workshop so it works good for me. The trick is to not ask closed questions that renders a ""yes"" or ""no"". 


Next step would be to actually engage in conversation. The above questions might work for that also, but the point of the second part of this is just to say more than a few words. For conversation you need both a started and something to continue the conversation with. In the future I'll try this 

""Hi, I need a female perspective on something, what do you think about my haircut? I just cut it short and I'm not fully convinced it was a good idea. *smile*""

It's true, I cut my hair very short (I'm really satisfied but that's beside the point) and actually would like a female perspective. I don't have to agree, that's not the point either. If she says ""I think it really suits you!"" I'll say thanks and let it be. If she says ""Well, I think you'd look better in longer hair"" I'll say smiling, ""Thanks, lucky me it'll grow back then!"". And if she asks why I'll say ""Well, firstly it's great during summer. Also I'm losing my hair and I hate comb overs *smile*"" 

Whatever works for you. The things you say must be honest and true. It's OK to show vulnerability (in many cases it's positive) but don't be a sad puppy. It all have to come from a place of humor. To be confident in your flaws is great.

Or do something completely different than above. But this is straight from a workshop I'm going through, and there's many more guides that says the same, so why not try?"
soc_874279,socialskills,reddit_comment,246,"I will be honest with you, you should totally leave. I will go through the three possible cases here, in relation to K.

1. **You don't tell your feelings to her and stay** : Pretty likely, right? (I myself have some serious problems with opening up). In this case you let an opportunity pass you by just because you **might** get a girl, and you're not even sure she likes you back. I'd say this is stupid, but I'm not the one to judge. 


2. **You tell your feelings to her and she doesn't feel the same**: Let's suppose you open up to her and she rejects you, that can be good if it happens before you make your decision on leaving or not. If she rejects you early, you can still go to a far away college and seize the opportunity. If she rejects you after you decide to stay, you will be in a bad position.


3. **You open up to her and she feels the same**. Nice, this one is pretty good ... but also tricky, I won't say that ""most relationships don't last forever"" because even if it has an ending, it still can be good. But there's also the fact that leaving home, and specially a toxic home, will make you grow and overall will be pretty good for you. 


Ah, don't forget debt .... College debt is pretty shitty in the US, right? If I could avoid it, I would."
soc_1652784,socialskills,reddit_comment,240,"&gt;I even feel discouraged because people on the Internet said to develop a comeback or tease. They said to embrace being made fun of. But if you look on my profile, you will see that I am not interested in such banter, teasing, trash-talking, etc.

Right on!  The solution is to be virtuous not stooping down to a lower level.  Be a role model and with patience you'll find yourself around decent people, because virtuous people want to be around other virtuous people and they tend to avoid the opposite.  It creates a sort of magnet like effect where decent people group and not so decent people group.

If they do not have the maturity of a 12 year old, explicitly saying how they're making you feel works and works well, as long as you're not being mean about it.  ""When you do that, it seriously hurts my feelings.""  Then just walk away.  Ignore their response.  Some people are hard headed.   They can soak it in slowly over time.  Do that and they will eventually become a better person.  You'll be making the world a better place.

&gt;Why won't others leave me alone?!

If people are coming up to you and bothering you, you're not coming up to them, that's harassment.  It's against the law so you can act accordingly if you need to.  Thankfully it's only homeless people and drunks that get like that typically so it's pretty rare."
soc_1105633,socialskills,reddit_comment,204,"I can relate to this a lot. I’m in my late 20s and it’s been a learning process. In college, it was a joke in my friend group that after three days you either loved me or hated me. It’s important to be your authentic self - I’ve made a lot of friends every where I go due to my personality, but it doesn’t mix well with everyone. You can adjust your personality and limit your jokes depending on the situation, but it’s up to you how you want to portray yourself. I really love my authentic self and deeply appreciate the people who receive my personality well. Yes, I joke a lot, say weird things, and overshadow a bit, but I also love to have a good time, can cheer you up and am deeply caring. It’s all about learning to adapt to situations and feeling people out. For example, I’m friends with someone who’s very introverted and has high social anxiety, I had to learn to understand and respect how they get to know someone versus how I do. All relationships require a bit of compromise, but ultimately the goal is to be yourself and you can be with the right people."
soc_1780822,socialskills,reddit_comment,252,"I think as one gets older these rules can start to be bent. Most of my friends these days are online, not people I’ve met irl (though a few I have met up with). I have calls with them and we regularly talk about detailed personal stuff. Some of them I’ve known for a couple years, but one of my best friends now only like 6 months. He’s now in a dnd group with me and is a mod on my discord server and I’m sending him a Christmas present (and yes we exchanged addresses to do this).

So it really depends on the person and types of friendships you’re building imo. I could always be wrong about anyone I meet, but my experience especially the ones I’ve met up with tells me that while it’s always prudent to be wary it’s also not auto-unsafe to get close to people online either, and that my intuition is good.

However—I also started making online friends at age 15 and didn’t give out personal information to anyone except the one who I met irl 2 years later until I was well into college and had years of experience at this stuff under my belt. So I’ve got the experience to trust myself—I wouldn’t recommend it to teenagers, and I don’t engage with the teenagers on my discord server this way because I would feel it is irresponsible.

For context on all of this, I am actually 22m like the guy OP is talking about."

soc_1124927,socialskills,reddit_comment,435,"I’m a girl and I work in IT.  I have a few things to tell you.  Many of my colleagues are introverts.  I am friendly but I’ve had a ton of anxiety issues.  It runs in my family.  I now take meds for anxiety because I would stress so bad that it made me physically sick and would wake me up at night.  Now I feel better.  Not totally different, just a bit better.  I’m actually more clear headed now because I don’t spin my wheels on worrying as much as I used to.

Back to the IT workforce - many awesome people are introverts.  I don’t know what field you are in, but it could apply to anything.  Sounds like you care about your job.  Believe me, the worry is more in your head than in other people’s.  Imagine walking into a room and everyone is ok with you, because that is probably reality.  As long as you aren’t putting people in danger or saying mean things, then you’re good.  People appreciate you, and value you, they just suck at telling you about it.  I can tell you that some of the shyest people at work are the most prized employees.  They rock, and are funny when they relax (some never really relax, but that’s ok too), and smart.  

I have other life stories too, and I promise you that if you give it a chance, after a while you’ll look back on this time of your life and think “wow that was tough, but look at all of these good experiences I’ve had”.  Try it.  Bad times always lead to something better.  Things you can’t even imagine.  If it’s that bad, you can move or change what you’re doing.  You can, and it’s your choice.  I did it a few times.  That was also hard because not everyone supported all of my decisions, but now I wouldn’t take any of it back, even the super sucky times.  If I didn’t go through those shitty times, then I would never have ended up doing the good stuff that came later.  One thing leads to another. 

I hope that helps.  If it’s doesn’t, then just know that there are people who know your value.  More people than you realize. 

I’m not a therapist or expert.  Those other posts sound sound like great advice.  Do those things.  You’ve gotta figure out what makes the most sense for you.  I wish you well on your life path.  One day it will be better than how you feel right now.  Don’t miss those good times in the future."

Like my bro he maybe just a late bloomer. Everyone is different. And maybe in some ways this maybe a blessing when he goes to college where he doesn’t just hang out with his own high school cliche. 

More importantly is his grades and how he deals with frustration/anger. That where you and your bro can really guide him by explaining the next time things flare up on how you guys deal with it. Talking about how things suck sometimes and how things don’t always go your way would help. Life’s up and down.

soc_979755,socialskills,reddit_comment,183,"I would say be patient because meaningful relationships are built up slowly over time. First, take your time while getting to know someone and invite them to a place that you like or over for an activity that you like to do! 

If you like to read, start a book club! If you like movies or just a particular movie, find someone with that same interest! Eventually, you'll find yourself making inside jokes and it will become easier to open up. Right now, your superficial relationships may seem a little shallow, but over time, you may find someone who will open up to you as you find you have more in common.

Most importantly, stick to what you like to do and who you like to be. The right people will gravitate towards you and you will make meaningful and lasting friendships.

The best way to break the ice is to ask someone what their favorite hobby, movie or activity, is.  When you get someone to talk about something they enjoy, they'll feel like they can trust you and share a common interest."

As many women on this discussion have said, they would be weirded out by you asking such a thing from them.

That is, unless you really like the girl and you're trying to force your way into her heart. Then I'd say focus that energy elsewhere more productive. Now, you do have the choice to go through with this and I am not judging you for that. A lot of men have won their wives this way. So who am I to say that it doesn't work?

But I, for one, am more comfortable starting on an honest footing and failing, then reevaluating my approach, than trying to be sneaky and succeeding. The reason is, I would never be satisfied winning this way. You seem like you're also that kind of person, or you wouldn't be asking. But I could be wrong.

soc_247538,socialskills,reddit_comment,256,"Its about 2 things.  Self-love and energy.

We tell ourselves not to ""bother"" anyone because we think so little about ourselves that we are convinced any interaction we have with someone will be a bother. We have to love ourselves to the fullest to be in a state that is eager and willing to give and receive love.  If we do not believe we are worthy of that love,  than we will not seek it.

Try affirmations when you wake up. ""I love myself. I love my life.  I am social. I am good looking.  I am worthy.  I am going to talk to someone new today.  I am going to make a new friend today.""

Once you start to grow as a person and have more confidence in your abilities and you are fully aware of how worthy you are to give and receive love you will have a whole new energy about you.  The goal is to bring as much happiness and beauty into the world as possible. If that is your goal then it isn't logical to believe you will bother someone by talking to them because you aren't a bother. You are a giver. 

Will you occasionally annoy someone or be told no by someone who has their own stuff going on?  Of course. That said,  their choice to not engage with you is their own personal choice and it has nothing to do with you.

If they are a meaningful and close person in your life, then yes, their opinions can matter and it’s totally okay to be effected by them. But if they are a person who barely has any place in your life, then their opinions shouldn’t matter, hence they don’t actually know what and who they are talking about.

soc_343659,socialskills,reddit_comment,926,"Here are my two cents.

1) Above all else, seek professional help. There is a difference between moderate social anxiety (i.e. being kind of uncomfortable at a party or talking to a girl) and SA severe enough to keep you from finding employment or leaving your house. People are so quick to dismiss professional help because they have this idea that they can overcome anything on their own (which is a good attitude to have, except when it's not). Mental health professionals exist for a reason - to help people through dark times. So just pick up the phone and schedule a consultation. The worst that can happen is they'll tell you you probably don't need therapy or medication, and you can just call yourself a pussy and move onto step 2. The best thing that could happen is you actually turn your life around in ways that you didn't think were possible.

2) Develop a set of principles to live your life by. Sit down and ask yourself what your values truly are and make the decision that you're not going to let yourself get in your own way. A lot of you will sit here on /r/socialskills and nod in agreement with the stuff you read but then at the end of the day you'll do nothing, because you don't take your values seriously. Facing your social anxiety is no different from facing any other type of fear, whether it be a giant spider on your wall, or fear of failure when starting a business. It takes discipline, grit, and a belief in something greater and more powerful than your own fears. Only you can decide that you want to break the cycle, and unfortunately a lot of you aren't ready for that and therefore will never change.

3) Face your fears until you can show yourself that you don't have anything to be afraid of. How you go about this is up to you and there are lots of creative ways to do it, but when it comes to SA, this means put yourself out there, into social situations. Start small. Do NOT start by going into a crowded night club at 1am (unless that's what you feel you are ready for). Maybe start by calling up an old friend and asking if they wanna play some video games. Then maybe have him introduce you to some of his other friends whom you don't know (a lot of SA surrounds interacting with strangers or unfamiliar people). Then maybe attend a smaller event on meetup.com and introduce yourself to everyone there. Then do a bigger event, etc. 

Again, as a continuation of #3, the trick is that you have to, especially in the beginning, override your instinct and *make* yourself go for it. There's simply no way around this step. As someone who experiences SA, you're never going to *want*, or *feel like*, going out and socializing. This is by far the most important thing to understand.

4) Get a job (sorry OP =P). Not because you ""just should,"" but because it supports #3. It forces you to go out there and talk to people. You don't *have* to get an extremely extroverted job like bartending, but the more extroverted, the better. One of the biggest things that helped me overcome my own anxiety and develop confidence was becoming an EMT and working on an ambulance crew. It forces you to approach people - to get up close and personal, give commands to other crew members and responders, and above all, it's allowed me to practice diving head first into potentially frightening situations before allowing me to talk myself out of it. I've been able to apply the attitude that I adopt on scene to almost all other aspects of my life and it's paid off tremendously. 

For those interested, I highly recommend this line of work and I'm happy to give a few tips on how you can get into it as well. It's easier than you think.

5) Never turn down an opportunity to ""socialize,"" however small the experience may be. Every time you come face to face with a human being - cashier, barista, neighbor, say hello and try to make a 1-2 sentence conversation out of it. This means don't say ""I'm fine"" and leave after being asked how you are. Tell a small story from your day - make a comment about the weather. *Anything*. The more confident you become in your conversational skills, the more confident you'll be going into unfamiliar social situations.

6) Reflect on your experiences. You have to tame your emotions and that means you have to meditate on them. If you do all of these things mindlessly but don't reflect and allow your emotions to run rampant, you'll probably just drive yourself crazy from all the anxiety that you experience. So it's extremely important to be mindful of what you're experiencing - keep a journal if you have to so that you can reflect on your progress and identify areas which need work in the future.

These are just some thoughts. I understand that most of us work best in logical, structured environments but unfortunately that's not the world we live in and that's probably why we've developed SA in the first place. As soon as you can accept the uncertainty and that there are multiple ways to reach the same goal and that it's *okay* to give up control, I think you'll be well on your way to conquering whatever fears you have."
soc_349294,socialskills,reddit_comment,126,"Sounds like you enjoy socializing and have a lot of time on your hands right now. Is it normal? Yes and no, I think it depends on the person and where they are in their career and life. If you’re feeling a bit out of it, you could try making a more social weekly routine. If you’re seeing people more on weekends (which is pretty standard for me, anyway) try finding more weeknight activities. Like a group fitness class, a trivia night, board game group or whatever’s interesting to you. During the day to be more social, go work on applications at a coffee shop two days a week, take a noon workout class, volunteer or something similar to break up your day. Hope this helps. "
soc_1199943,socialskills,reddit_comment,100,"I guess what i wanted to tell you is to accept it as the way it is. If you get easily attached then accept that you wil likely get disapointed or dont get attached. Its your choice, embrace disapointment and low expectations because without any expectations you would not try to assume anything from other people because youre not expecting friendships or anything you would just enjoy the interaction as it is.

EDIT: Also you have to be honest to yourself are you interacting with people because you want a friend(s) or because you want to truly interact with them?"
soc_1092020,socialskills,reddit_comment,207,"They complement each other very well when you are genuinely busy in your life. You pursue your own hobbies and goals while interacting with people on the side. Your social life improves in conjunction with other areas of your life, not merely in isolation. As you level up in different areas of your life, you will be able to interact with new people and build deeper connections.

Having people come to you starts with you putting yourself out there. You have to be confident and bring positive vibes and energy to your interactions. You have to connect with people on a deeper level, especially in person. Don't do polite small talk. Make conversations meaningful, memorable, and purposeful. Talk about yourself, and get people to talk about themselves. Exchange ideas, opinions, hobbies, interests, and all that. Take leadership and courage to invite people to your various activities. For example, instead of texting, why don't you ask people to do Zoom calls with you ? Furthermore, you need to find ways to provide value to other people through your expertise/services. People love that. They will look up to you as somebody knowledgeable and wise.

People follow a herd mentality. If somebody sees you as extremely valuable, so will others."
soc_533859,socialskills,reddit_comment,615,"Absolutely. I share this problem. I find that what keeps me from talking clearly is how much I think when talking. I used to formulate what I'd say in my mind before talking and I would try to rigidly stick to what I'd thought up but would then forget exactly what I was supposed to say and get stuck trying to remember, a la I'm a clumsy speaker. 

\-

I realized that clearly trying to script it wasn't working. What I tried to do especially for things like informational presentations is learn as much about the subject as possible (or at least make sure I know the vital information) so that its easier to recall. Not only that but I went with a ""just don't think"" mentality. Specifically I wouldn't try to script what id say in my mind and would rely the knowledge id gathered before hand to keep me afloat. 

\-

Other things I at least try to keep in mind are things i can default to for unexpected responses/situations. For example: If I'm wrong/my argument is in question, I can default to things like ""I hadn't considered that, tell me more"" or ""Okay im curious, why do you think that"". I list concrete responses here but another good way to think about it is to find an attitude to base yourself around for unexpected situations. So for the previous example the attitude is curiosity. I like that explanation better because it helps me to keep the way in which I respond vague so that I don't get caught up in wordplay. 

\-

You're probably not always arguing but curiosity is (probably) the best way to think about anything you don't see coming. Maybe someone said something that was off putting. Ask why they said it, or what they mean. It might have been a misunderstanding. Honesty is the most vital part of conversation as well. Say what you feel. If you're confused, flustered, lost, embarrassed. Convey it to those around you. 

\-

You seem like an analytical person just like me. Listen I certainly dont know everything and neither do you. You dont have all the answers and that is normal. I dont either. If you feel like you said the wrong thing, Its okay to remember that you dont know everything. Heck even continuing the whole honesty thing you can let people know to take it with a grain of salt. Or other wise you can default to a subjective argument: ""Thats what I heard anyway"" or ""I havent looked into it very far but I heard..."".  Id call that an analytic attitude. Look at a situation from all perspectives. I live my life by the idea that I know not as much as i could, and that reality is evidence based(aka see to believe(or otherwise have VERY credible sources/reasonable arguments)) Empathize with your problems and if other people dont then let it be known that its their problem. 

\-

Everyday conversation is still pretty nuanced and arguments are a small part of that. ~~Most~~ All of your talking career is going to rely on what your life experience has to offer. If youre anything like me, then thats probably not too much. Find it in yourself to explore at some point. Its another conversation entirely but its a good place to end. Have a curious outlook, dont think too much, or at least try. Im only still practicing myself but as a wise man once told me ""If youre an introvert, its really important that you say whats on your mind, there nothing more important than that man"". it probably wasnt exactly like that but you get the point.

soc_1686835,socialskills,reddit_comment,119,"Egotistical?

It's pretty standard to be annoyed by strangers coming up to you and trying to promote something you have no interest in. That's true whether it's unwanted romantic overtures, people trying to sell you an MLM or evangelicals asking if you've been saved.

I'm more likely to do a kind rejection if the person seems shy or awkward about it than if they're using some smug bullshit from a pick-up artist website/clearly realise that what they're selling is a scam/open by aggressively telling me I'm going to hell. However, the more times I've been interrupted that day the lower my patience will be.

soc_473556,socialskills,reddit_comment,175,"Can you give some concrete examples of why the other parties think that you're obnoxious? Or what did you say during those conversations? Just trying to understand the situation a bit more. In any case, you being like this could be due to anything really. You could try getting therapy from professionals.  
  
As for your question, I suggest being more open and accepting other's opinions (i.e. more empathy, less judgemental/narcism). Person A =/= person B, each has their own perspective on something. Just because you think their advice/opinion is wrong/not useful, doesn't mean it actually is. Besides, who's to say that YOUR advice/opinion is the correct thing? Try to understand their point of view.  
  
If you do give your advice/opinion (or disagree with someone else), perhaps do it in a clear but still subtle way instead of being blunt.  
  
But also know when to offer your opinion and when not to. Sometimes you just gotta shut up, have self-control and assess the flow of the conversation (makes having a conversation more fun for both parties)."

soc_1505013,socialskills,reddit_comment,243,"Because you are reflecting on this makes you a good person. Also, it is important to know that you must first be good to yourself. I have done some shitty things in the past, but those things are in the past. I have taken measures to atone for my wrong doings when I felt it necessary. How did I know it was necessary? I couldn’t stop thinking about it, and every time I ran into that person or someone they know I felt bad about it. So, when I did run into anyone involve I openly shared my regret for what I had done, and when I was forgiven I never brought it up again. I still feel crappy for doing it, but I know I will never do anything like it again, and that gives me solace. We are all on a journey in life. How you travel is up to you. Mistakes are ok because they are important learning experiences we need to mature and grow into the persons we want to be. I hope this helps. Again, be good to yourself, and try to find the distinction between your own opinion of yourself and the opinion others have of you. Be open and honest about these feelings with your friends and loved ones. You may find that you are wrong about what others think of you, and be pleasantly surprised that people think more highly of you than you think.🌸"
soc_132972,socialskills,reddit_comment,144,"How old are you exactly? I won't judge, it just helps when giving advice. Or maybe then, the better question is: what have you gone through in your life?

I ask because experience counts for a lot. I would say don't be too impatient, but good for you that you have a desire to be a substantial person.

Consider light exercise. Do you enjoy walking at all? Is your neighborhood a place you can go for a walk every other day? Walking (or any light exercise) is famous for 'waking' the mind up.

Last bit of advice... a little more difficult, but in case it will help I'll say it. Imagine you have found the woman of your dreams, someone you really respect and want to protect. Try to live like that's your mission. If you do, you'll find these things and that life."

soc_344093,socialskills,reddit_comment,287,"I'm kinda going through the same thing right now. But what my friends and I think is that she isn't dating this guy (just more or less with him for whatever reason, possibly friends either benefits). She never refers to him as her boyfriend or that they are dating, only by name and ""the guy I'm seeing"". One of my friends in particular says that if he meant anything to her she would refer to him as her boyfriend and nothing less. My friends believe that whenever she brings him up in front of me (in conversation) it's to get a reaction out of me. I honestly don't doubt that; my friends say she is testing me. 

So what my friends are telling me is to be a bit more straight forward with my feelings. Not straight out dropping a bomb on her, but little at a time saying things along the liners of ""I care about you and I'm here for you"". But at the same time trying to get the point across that I have feelings for her and want to be more than friends. That's where I struggle some if the time. My closest friend says that it's worth the risk to take these steps. 

What I would say to you is, ask yourself what your end goal is with this person. What can you do to reach your end goal? (If you want to stay friends then I'm not sure about telling her your feelings. But if you want to be with her then I'd say you can either wait or go for it.). Honestly, it's just up to you and what you want from it that dictates what you end up doing."
soc_307766,socialskills,reddit_comment,773,"I went through a long period of time where I felt like I had no friends and everyone who said they were my friends were either lying or not interested in spending time with me. That was my first mistake. Let me tell you what the one, single biggest key to developing social skills and making friends is: make yourself someone YOU want to be around. If you're on this sub you probably feel the way I felt and you think people don't like you because you are x, y, and/or z. In actuality, people don't like you because you don't like you. Step one: learn to like yourself. 


I felt like my interactions with people were always the wrong thing to say. I still feel like this sometimes, but I've learned to identify what I dislike about conversations I have and minimize it. It's hard and it takes practice. To tell the truth, much of this will probably be difficult but there's no way around it. You have to go at it headfirst and keep going. If you give up, you'll just go back to your old ways. I'm in college and constantly surrounded by new people and that's how I started practicing conversations. I'd meet someone and try to engage as much as possible but not feel pressured because chances are I'd never see them again anyway. But if I did and they liked talking to me then look! I made a friend! The more people engaged back, the more I knew I was improving. Step two: practice, practice, practice. 


Once I had more confidence in my personal skills I focused on branching out to people I'd see more often and wanted to be friends with. That was a bit hard since it involved some soul-searching to find out what I liked and then going out to find other people who liked it, but once I did I had a place I could belong and a good base for conversation. I joined a sorority and reached out to people at work I liked being around. But the thing about that was *actively putting myself in those situations*. Like a lot of socially awkward people, I really hated asking people to hang out and always wanted to be the one getting asked. Some advice that I got early on was when I first started trying was to always say yes when someone asks you to go somewhere. Only then did I notice that people asked me to go places a lot more than I thought. If I couldn't go, I learned to always reschedule something else with them. If it was ""oh man wouldn't it be great if we..."" I learned to follow up on that. They very rarely say no. Getting over that was a huge hurdle for me and like many things, it can still be difficult. Step three? Don't be afraid to ask. 


There were times when I felt like I was going backwards. Sometimes I lost sight of the person I wanted to be and went back to my old ways. Sometimes people I felt like I had bonded with just stopped talking to me. Sometimes I went places and hated it! There were setbacks, still are, but through sheer perseverance I pushed that kind of negativity OUT. If I said something that felt weird I'd gauge their reaction and if they didn't seem to mind, I brushed it off; if they did I apologized or laughed it off. Along the way there have been some people who definitely didn't like me and it was hard to get over that but I had to in order to keep going. It was a learning experience. Step 4: learn from your mishaps. 

All in all, I had to put myself around people like myself, but most of it was self-improvement. It took me probably 6 or 7 years to get where I am now, with a sorority full of sisters I adore (yes it sounds cliche) and my closer circle of ~8 or so friends whom I talk to more regularly and see more often. It was a very long learning process. I'm not going to say it was easy, but it isn't out of anyone's reach. If you read this far and you're saying ""well I can't do that because of this"", WRONG. You say things like that and you've already lost. Keep practicing, learn to recognize when/where you might be lacking and it will come. 

Tl:dr be yourself, like forreal but be the you you'd want to be friends with and keep working at it until you are "
soc_1594803,socialskills,reddit_comment,126,"This is just my opinion, and I may be wrong, but I think you need to stop worrying about trying to fit in socially and more about your mental health.

It's basically asking ""how can I be Normal socially when I feel dead inside?"" Well... you won't. You need to take care of yourself because nomatter what bandaid you use, the root issue will bring up new problems.

If these folks are real friends they'll understand if you're going through something heavy. You won't need to have a face. You won't need to pretend to be something you're not. You don't even need to make good conversation. Just feel what you feel, work on your mental health, and let the social thing take care of itself."
soc_241161,socialskills,reddit_comment,1208,"Hey man, glad you came and sought out some help! 

If you ever feel like it, you can PM me and I would be more than happy to help you along with whatever comes to mind, for now though - here are some things you could consider and even try!

**-DBT/CBT**
If I could recommend anything right off the bat, it would be DBT/CBT. These both, being Dialectical &amp; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. They can be done both on your own or with a counciler, it really is up to you. 

**What is in it for me?** Good question! D/CBT focus both on the mindsets of life (at least from my experience). Not only will they help you boost your confidence and social skills - but yourself as well. You will literally feel your entire perspective do a 180, and it is beautiful!
For CBT, I recommend reading *Feeling Good by David Burns* - it is an amazing book which lays out a lot of perspective-altering things you can try!

Now for DBT, I know a lot about the ins-and-outs of this because I was in PHP based on it! These skills helped me greatly, 

1.  **Mindfulness** - Holy hell is this big brother. If you are anxious, sad, or just in a shitty mood - mindfulness can go 'Haha, nope!' and throw that crap out the door with just a little practice. So what is it? Mindfulness means being mindful on the present, think of it as active meditation (Meditation is a great tool too, more on that later ;) ) An easy way to practice mindfulness is just focus on the present, engage in [stream of consciousness writing] (http://www.wikihow.com/Write-Stream-Of-Consciousness), and accepting what you feel and moving on. 

2. **Radical Acceptance** - The first step to improving an issue is to acknowledge it's presence. I can hear your concerns, *if I face and think about what is bothering me, it will only make it worse!* I won't lie, it will suck to think about it - temporary suffering is a lot better than an eternal one though. Accept what you are now, all your edges and cracks - for that makes us human. Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmHLYhxYVjA)on accepting all our flaws. You will begin to realize that our greatest obstacles will become your strongest ladders if you treat them with open arms!

3. **Prospering Habits and Thoughts** - Imagine if you could make an army. No, not of soldiers and pew-pew guns (though that would be cool too) - I am talking about your own personal army, all in your mind. The more soldiers and tanks you have to your positive mind, the harder it will be for that bitch of a negative mind to take over, so how do you recruit them? Let's look at the big self-improving habits you can pick up today;
-Exercise: This is amazing, even if you just walk around the block every morning, make a commitment to get out there and push your body - it will reward you greatly for it!

-Sleep: Poor sleep, little or too much - can really affect how productive you are and your mood in general. Most feel great from 8 hours of sleep, but I suggest experimenting and seeing what you like - such as I function best on 7 1/2 hours. 

-Nutrition: This is the cousin of exercise, and having them in harmony will make both your physical AND mental health explode. I wouldn't really recommend rigid diets, just eat good and enjoy the food you eat!

-Avoiding drugs: For me, nothing is as important as being aware, and that is also the centerpiece of mindfulness. How can one expect to improve if they just mask something with illusions? It doesn't work, steer clear of these. 

-Goal-Setting/Accomplishing: This is huge, and worthy of its own section even. This will give you meaning, confidence, and energy all in one damn habit. Give it a try!

and now for my favorite method of all....

4.) **Opposite Action** - This is the paragon of smashing the hell out of anything I have come across, and is the main thing of DBT that helped me. The premise is simple, when you feel like doing something in a bad mood - you do the OPPOSITE action of your thoughts. 

So for example, 

Emotion: Anxiety
Thought: Avoid/Run away!
Opposite Action: Approach/Attack!

~~

Emotion: Depression
Thought: Isolate/Shrink
Opposite Action: Expand/Get out there

(This one is very huge, pay attention to it ^^)


---------------------------------

So now what? 

Well I am not quite done yet, I got some other bits and bobs of information that have helped me greatly in the past and currently - keeping all I mentioned in context of course. 

1.) **Becoming the virus** - The number one thing I suggest to anyone wanting to improve socially is to get out there and be involved. The number one thing is to look into things that will push you out of your comfort zone. See a new group dancing in public? Go join them! See a weird convention hosting next week? You will be there! Some tools I can recommend for any newbie virus is;

- Facebook Events (This is literally the only reason I have an FB)
- Meetup.com (Amazing place for connecting!)
[The grand list of hobbies](http://www.notsoboringlife.com/list-of-hobbies/)
- Libraries. They are the real life equivalent of taverns in RPGs. Hog all those damn fliers and get to the calendar.

2.) **Know your Legend** Everyone has a personal legend (ripping off The Alchemist for this, READ IT if you haven't already!!) that drives their passion. What is it you want to do? What drives you past unbeatable odds? It's okay if nothing comes to mind currently - it takes quite a bit to develop. Just keep this in mind when you go out there and explore, *what do I really, really want?*

3.) **Meditation** - If you think sitting and doing nothing is easy, think again. Meditation is an amazing hobby to pick up, and it will improve your relaxation, discipline, and awareness. Check out [this online book](http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe1-4.html) about both meditation and a continuation of mindfulness. 

---------------------------

**One last thing,**

Imagine you are holding a glass of water in the air. At the start, its not so bad. However, the longer you wait, the more strain your arm feels. You begin to shake, and by some divine nature the glass of water now feels like ten stacked. 

This is the same for our problems in life. You need to address them if you want to solve them. I suggest this method:
**ALA (Action, Learn, Adapt)**

Take action first, even if ignorantly. Even if you mess up - you will know where to get back up. Read [this](http://startupbros.com/overthinkers-guide-taking-action-complete-guide/), and go kick some ass. 

Also I want to invite you - and anyone else, into a little group I am starting called **Floater's Guide**. The premise is exactly what I told you in all my advice above - plus a bit adventure. The goal is to make a tight-knit group of explorers to see how much of life we can discover for ourselves, and help others get there as well!

Take care man, and know you are not alone in this journey!"

When we first got together I wasn't making money and he was paying for everything. This last summer, he was changing jobs and I paid for everything.

All it took to work out was a conversation. I brought up my education one day, explained the work-school balance and how hard it can be, and he said that was cool. He works full time, I work when I can while going to school. For the two of us, that setup works, but everyone is different.

In your situation, I'd say keep doing what you're doing (if you want) and try to figure out what direction she's heading in life. If she's not making active efforts to support herself or to make money, your lives probably aren't going the same direction and you should consider moving on.

These two statements are particularly telling to me. Firstly, it tells me you don't have a lot going on. Secondly, it tells me that you lack a bit of self-awareness and that's really your problem.

I can tell you right now you're going to have a hard time making friends and it's because you're focusing on the wrong things. Don't focus on making friends, focus on working on yourself. You need to decide on goals and start working on them and I'm not talking about your social life. The number of friends you have doesn't define you. Friends come and go. You are not focused on *you* enough. People will naturally gravitate towards you more as you pursue your own path, it's a natural byproduct."
soc_1712382,socialskills,reddit_comment,214,"Yes - I've encountered this before a number of times.

Tricky bit is - people who have this sort of ego-fragility are almost always the most likely to take what you are saying as being really mean or attacking them. To attempt to help them ""see the light"" - you have to \*really\* tread carefully - and even then its very unlikely you'll get the message across without triggering them in some way.

Sympathy and support can be comforting for them - and sometimes I wonder if this is just the right move over giving any honest advice at all.

However - I've gone this route with really ego-fragile friends before - and they ended up \*really\* grabbing onto that - and asked for a lot of time and attention, to the point of not entirely respecting my boundaries. And, to a person - none of the friends who were like this have come around and reciprocated that at all.

I think all of these behaviors ultimately stem from a lack of emotional maturity, and a lack of empathy skills. IMO its up to you to decide how much you want to give - but just give charitably without expectation of reciprocation or of being able to count on them as a ""core friend"""

soc_224554,socialskills,reddit_comment,521,"Yeah, I wanted to create an account that not everyone I knew could identify me by and as change was what I was seeking back then this is what I came up with.

Personally I think you're coming at this the wrong way. You're trying to identify yourself as a person based on your disease. ""this constant debate of whether to be normal vs. abnormal"", what is ""normal""? Basically I think that you should work on yourself and try to become better at it but realizing that the point you're at every day is good enough, but never good enough not to improve at. Another thing is that people with aspbergers generally have a hard time reading social situations and people judging them, this can be seen both as a blessing and as a curse. It can be a curse because it means you might be socially uncalibrated but it can also mean that you don't care about peoples opinions of you which can be great. The CEO of the biggest pick-up companies in the world probably has some sort of mild aspbergers and autism which he said was a big problem for him in the beginning of him learning pick-up but it also helped because he never cared what people thought of him so he'd just keep going until eventually he learned the stuff and he is one of the most confident and social people you'd ever see.

Basically, the gist is that I don't think it's healthy to try and label yourself as one thing or another, especially when you haven't actually been diagnosed. I'd say that it's up to others to label you by what they think of you (funny, boring, awkward, nice, etc.) and it's up to you to be the best you can be and not really care what labels they'd put on you. Back when I was a lot less confident I'd always try to include everyone and try and make people like me, paradoxically though this worked against me as I'd never stand up for what I really believed or even pitch into a debate if I didn't think everyone would agree with me. What this led to was people getting a feeling of me not being genuine and not participating in a discussion, I also became sort of a pushover where I'd never have any opinions on things. I realized that it's better to share your honest opinions and thoughts and have 50% think you're a GREAT person and 50% think you're dumb than to have 100% think you're just the average Joe or Jane and treating you as such. Because the 50% that do like you are going to absolutely love you and you'll have great friendships and the other 50% are going to be people that you would've never been able to connect with on a deeper level due to having a large difference in beliefs and opinions.

If you have any questions or if I was unclear about something just ask, it's 5:30 am here and I desperately need to get some sleep so I haven't really proof-read this post."
soc_55609,socialskills,reddit_comment,284,"I speak from experience. Last summer, I ran my own franchise that required me to call up previous customers that I had never met before, along with new customers that I had met face to face. Prior to the job, I absolutely DREADED making any phone call, and you can just forget it if you think I'd leave a message. Heavens no. My anxiety wouldn't let me. But after just two months of working, I was a phone calling champ. Nowadays, I won't hesitate to make a phone call. 

My advice to you: I know this might sound counterintuitive, but perhaps you could try telemarketing. I doubt it will be challenging to get a job in telemarketing, as they'll take anyone who has a set of vocal chords. With your anxiety, it obviously will be difficult at first. If you are tenacious about the job, then you will likely overcome your anxiety. Also of note is that you don't know and never will really know the people you are calling. They are of little significance to you and don't matter. They're just another 7 digit number in your call list. No need to be anxious about what they think of you, or messing up (Is this where your anxiety lies?). While you are employed as a telemarketer, you can search for a long term job that caters to your needs. If the job causes you to slowly overcome your anxiety, you'll have a whole new array of jobs that you'd be able to apply to. Everyone has a different definition of what it means to succeed in life. Overcoming ones flaws and becoming a better person is in my personal definition. How about you?

Basically what i have done is simple cut contact, e.g. remove from fb, whatsap, etc. In my case he probably wont even notice that i have done that, and i think it will be the same for you if you take the same course of action. These people clearly dont care enough about you and your time to actually take time to see you so why should you even bother with them? Treat them the way they are treating you now, ignoring. 

If they do notice and approach you about it, respectfully but bluntly tell them how you feel about them now and you dont want to put the extra time in people who dont care about your time. If they get angry, just walk off and ignore them. If they feel bad then you decide if they are worth another chance, they may have just not realized what they were doing. If you give them another chance and they are still the same, i recommend you to do what i suggested if they get angry.

soc_237859,socialskills,reddit_comment,300,"When you said that someone came up to you and told you to kill yourself, I was really shocked. But then you said youre still in high school, and then it made sense. While that person was disgusting for saying that to you, High School is filled with a bunch of immature humans who arent quite mature enough to fully understand themselves but feel as though they have reached a point where they understand everything. So, you cant take what that person said seriously.

In terms of not being happy, Im sorry you feel this way. Are you clinically depressed? If you dont know, I suggest finding out. Theres nothing wrong with having depression, bipolar disorder, or anything. But it needs to be addressed and managed. If you have no deficits and am just naturally sad, then I recommend delving deep within yourself and simply not caring what others will think. I know you may feel like loser for not having friends, but thats simply not true and suicide should never be an option for sadness. Screw people if theyre not working out for you right now. Just own you. Find out what makes the world a mystery to you and learn about it. Just find what sparks your interest. As soon as you stop giving a shit about whether or not you have friends, I bet that you will start to find people that you want to hang with. 

Keep in mind youre only in high school and the saying ""it gets better"" is very very true. I am a 23 year old dude who use to have  a severe stutter, and would wake up every morning dreading socializing with people. Things didnt get better for me until college and im extremely happy within myself (on most days) now. "
soc_527155,socialskills,reddit_comment,135,"Learned helplessness is something you learn by taking it up that way. There are people who suffer failures over and over yet persist. In fact people who suffer repeated failures but learn from each of them often meet with success out of sheer determination and belief in one's self.

That's part of why grit is a better determinant of life sucess than IQ.

So to put it simply, learned helplessness inevitably follows repeated failure **if that is how you take it up**. If you fail a lot but see it as you improving your social skills you likely won't fall into LH because you are improving ever slightly even if you aren't succeeding like you want to.

So your question of whether LH follows from failure is a question only you can answer for yourself."
soc_65145,socialskills,reddit_comment,190,"No problem, I completely understand. 

That is exactly what a soft plan conversation would be like.

It is entirely possible for your coworkers to like you and not invite you to after hours activities. When people are in long term relationships or married, they tend to socialize more with other couples. Do not take it personally. Even some of the strongest friendships can be strained when one friend enters a long-term relationship.

It could still be possible to initiate an activity without needing to invite them to your place. Try to find an organized event hosted in a public space like a bowling league or pub trivia night. Depending on your personality, you can go alone, see what it is like, and find out the rules and how to enter. Then you can talk to your coworkers or other people who you think might be interested and see if they are interested in starting a team with you (you may not want to mix the two groups of people). 

If you figure out what the questions are, feel free to ask here or in a private message. I won't judge! "
soc_1217916,socialskills,reddit_comment,236,"It's great that you're making a serious effort into improving yourself socially and with women! I think the execution is a bit off there though, here's what I mean.

The problem with ""pick up"", even if you have the best of intentions like you do with wanting to create genuine connections, is that you're choosing the hardest possible way to meet new women especially for your current ""social skill level"". 

Being able to approach an attractive woman randomly in public that you don't know is arguably the toughest thing a man can do, and if that man lacks social ability or emotional control (fear solving, etc), it only adds to this problem. I don't think this is something the pick up community understands much.

Have you considered treating dating as an extension of your social life? If you create a social life of friends and other people in your network, it would make it much easier to date women because you're already building genuine connections with so many people.

This book is a great one on the topic: [https://rocketshippublishing.com/outside-the-box-to-box-book/](https://rocketshippublishing.com/outside-the-box-to-box-book/) 

If you do want to stick with approaching random women, it can work (I've done it), but I would probably start practicing on lower risk people like cashiers and clerks to at least develop the skill set but even then, it can still take a ton of work. Up to you tho, best of luck either way!"
soc_1028661,socialskills,reddit_comment,357,"Also, body language goes a long way. 

If a person seems uncomfortable, but they are also facing you, moving towards you, or especially if their feet are pointing towards you- then even if they are experiencing that special uncomfortable feeling of being shy, they probably still want to hang out. 

If the person is turning away from you, pointing their feet towards the door, and inching further away from you all the time, then the kind of uncomfortable they are at that moment is probably not including wanting to be around you as a part of it. 

The two situations where this body language piece is not true are in the sidle and the fight. 

If a person has sidled up next to you, they aren't facing you, and their feet are likely pointing away from you as well, but typically they are facing the same third thing that you are also facing. Bringing joint attention to a shared focus can go either way. But it's a great (indirect and less overstimulating) way to try to hang out with a person whose shyness makes them uncomfortable. 

And, of course, if someone is getting ready to fight you, either because they are targeting you, or because they're feeling the need to defend themselves, they are also squaring up to you, facing you, and likely pointing their feet towards you. But if you're aware enough to notice if a person is feeling shy, you can probably sense the hostility in this type of situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As a side note- shy is a special kind of uncomfortable. Like squares and rectangles.  Shy is a kind of uncomfortable, but not all kinds of uncomfortable are shyness. 

And as for being desperate or creepy... you can control your intentions, but you can't always control how you are perceived by others.

Of course, with masks and social distancing, this crap is all harder. I don't know.

soc_100845,socialskills,reddit_comment,459,"This is tricky...I'll suggest a few things. Use at your own discretion. The best idea is to completely ignore him and then succeed at life. Success is the best revenge. If you really can't deal and have to do something, read on:

#1 - Being smaller doesn't mean you can't kick his ass. Take some martial arts. Tell the sensei exactly your problem, he's heard it before. In a few weeks you can learn a few moves that can not only hurt him but put him in a position of submission where you can make him look weak in front of others and get him to verbally agree to leave you alone. 

#2 - be funnier, smarter and wittier to his face. You might want to practice running too...he might chase you. But essentially you make him look like a complete idiot in front of people. Tease him, laugh at him, call him out on being exactly what he is. If he gets enraged, run - keep laughing, but run...somewhere safe!

#3 - This is risky, but if he's verbally abusing you behind your back, verbally abuse him to his face. When he says let's fight you say ' I don't fight. I'm not a primate. I believe in peace (you can shout this at him, whoever overhears you will be on your side). But you are a fucking douchebag and the world would be a better place if your mother could have afforded the abortion."" This is where you might need to run again.  Sometimes if you really yell at someone, like an enraged gorilla would, they'll get scared. Pretend you're possessed. EDIT - Not 'crazy' possessed, but 'irate' possessed. Like Batman on a really bad day.  

#4 - Outsmart him. This might be the hardest one and require the most effort. Make him understand that you are smarter than him. Get him in trouble somehow, spread a rumor about him, make his life difficult and then let him know it was you. Difficulty level = expert.  

#5 - Confront him in front of people. Say 'hey I heard you said xyz'. And then call him a liar or a coward because only old ladies and little girls talk behind other peoples back's. If he's a very angry guy, ask him why he's so angry? Sometimes if you genuinely get him to think about what he's doing/saying he'll realize how dumb it is. You can either be mean to him, or just very neutrally ask him what's up and never get emotional. You'll have to judge for yourself...but not showing emotion yet being brave enough to confront him might get him to respect, or even look up to you. 

Good luck. Only use your new powers for gold.

soc_687793,socialskills,reddit_comment,250,"A lot of what dating is, is a risk. Haha.

I've gone on dates with women over the past couple years where I've used both dating apps and met people in real everyday life. 

For the most part, I'm a pretty social person, so the amount of people I was (and still am) meeting in real life was/is higher than on dating apps, but I think overall, the struggle I've had with online dating is the fact that the majority of the time I'm expecting a hit or miss.

There's usually some context you can work off of when you're meeting someone in real life (like a mutual friend or their actions), but in online dating it feels like a gamble (50-50 chance). 

Nonetheless, I am someone that encourages the use of both. My reasoning is that for every bad date that you do inevitably experience is one date closer to finding someone that you like (and the payoff of finding that person is amazing and worth it!).

Both dating and relationships require work and effort. Unfortunately, regardless of who you are there is no ""natural"" way of meeting people, it all requires some sort of effort on your part (like going to bars, having mutual friends set you up on a blind date, going to parties/gatherings, making conversation).

Ultimately it is up to you to decide, I bid you good luck from the bottom of my heart and wish you happiness. This online stranger is rooting for you! :)"
soc_381820,socialskills,reddit_comment,190,"Your tone of voice communicates your emotional state. The voice can tell many secrets about a person. Research has shown the voice can tell us about the size, state of health and mood of a person. Notice the nuances in emotion when I say How are you doing? As you eluded to it’s not what you say but how you say it that matters more. Think about it, if you are at a party, smiling and talking with your friends. Your tone of voice is likely to be friendly. Now, if you are exhausted and someone walk up to you. Imagine the difference in your tone of voice in the second example. Your tone of voice is likely to be lower. Adjusting your tone when you speak is vital to keep the attention of your listener. Use the variety of tone to express your emotions.

I've also considered prostitutes a time or two since I feel it would be near-impossible to lose my virginity at my age otherwise. But I know deep down I could never go through with it for several reasons:

One, prostitution is illegal in most places and I don't want to risk going to jail.

Two, I don't want to risk catching an STD.

Three, I don't have hundreds or thousands of dollars to waste on meaningless sex when there are other things I could spend money on that are either far more important or would bring me more joy in the long run.

Four, I know I would never enjoy the sex when the only reason she's doing it is because I'm paying her to. At best, she'd be indifferent to me and at worst she'd rather kill me than touch me. Not exactly a turn on.

So while it may be a long, tough journey, I'd rather wait until I can attract a woman on my own. She doesn't have to be madly in love with me, but it should at least be a strong like. Any woman who would turn me down for being inexperienced probably isn't someone I should be with anyway. Paying a hooker is most definitely not the same as having a real girlfriend (even if they offer the ""girlfriend experience"").

Basically, acting cringey. No one your age is expected to be very social because you're currently in the middle still of figuring out who you even are as a person.   


You're 100% right in that you won't speak to the vast majority of anyone you interact with at your highschool after graduation, so you could if you want take this as a great opportunity to get out of your comfort zone and talk to people, but if you don't want to that's entirely okay! College is the same experience basically, but you're apart from your parents. Most people grow the most socially in college, so you can always wait three years and then start socializing then (most colleges have activities which basically force students to become friends with each-other).   


I was a huge loner in highschool. I basically sat at home and played World of Warcraft and only socialized outside of school every 2-4 months. I did do a lot of talking with people over voice chat on my computer though, and as a person with social anxiety that helped a ton as I later would move into socializing in person, so that might be worth considering. Find an interest and join a discord group about it, chat in there to build up your skills over text and occasionally hop into voice chats with others.  


As an adult I put the time in to socializing (mainly through just chatting to coworkers 40 hours a week) and now it's a breeze to me. There are people much younger than me who are fantastic at making conversation and building relationships, but that's only because they decided to personally make that a priority over other things (like in your case, academics). Don't feel the need to push yourself in any direction that makes you too uncomfortable, the fact that you're even asking about this means you're in a good spot to be growing plenty as a person over the next few years. I'd personally recommend popping out of your comfort zone just once every few weeks or so to test the waters and work on building that skill a tad, but that's up to you and in the long run it won't make much of a difference as your social skills will skyrocket immediately once you finish gradeschool."

My advice is to talk to someone face-to-face. Figure out who you trust most in life and tell them how you feel.

While in America or Australia this may be less common. 

I'd expect people at 25 to know: 

* How to do basic cooking and cleaning
* How to correctly handle money, bank accounts, bills, groceries
* How to talk to people. (This doesn't mean you have to be the life of the party but know when something is inappropriate to ask or recognise when the person wants to disengage from the conversation.)

Everyone is different and the important thing is that you're working towards improving yourself. Don't be too hard on yourself.

soc_604213,socialskills,reddit_comment,979,"Hey,

&amp;#x200B;

so two things come to my mind: I remember someone once told me, that if you want to find out how somebody is doing something (i doesnt matter in the end if you would like to copy his habit or not), you literally must try to figure out their technique, strategy, underlining priciple, ... whatever you want to call i) - given the assupmtion that men in general are in opposition to women more orientated on things like this (technique, strategy, underlining pricnipe). Again like i said, you dont necessarily want to copy his habit, cause from what i´ve read, you dont like his bevahiour and think its too much, but on the other hand, you would also like to be more active.

&amp;#x200B;

The hard thing is to get a grasp on their ""technique"". There are two way´s how to figure out the how.

1.) Difficult, fast and kinda only practicable in theory, cause it would really take the wind out of the sails in an instant:

You confront him in a 4-eye situation directly - like: Hey, i have to say, in the last time you are often very ""\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" - here you fill in a word to describe him. You can use a more positive sounding word, or more negative, or at best try both sides like starting with a positive one, not to piss him of already at the beginning. For example agenda setting - egoistically or actively - aggressive or social pioneer - being rude or taking the lead - being too dominant. Keep in mind and this is a general crucial reminder: You also need to be specific on what you actually mean. So is his behavior for all topics discussed (i cant believe that 100 %, cause he cant be witty on all topics) or, what the other way no would be - is your group lacking diversity in topics. Ok - back on track. Depending on where you want to direct him with you intention. This is now up to you and the question you want to ask yourself would be (at least from my point of view): What do i really want. Do i want him to change, getting more receptive or do i want to be more like him. This is up to you and you can an should think about how you would like it to be in the short, middle and long run. But this is now where it gets tricky to really anticipate the preferred outcomes and all furhter instructions would be too speculative...

&amp;#x200B;

2.) More easyliy, steady and not so obvious.

Don´t imagine a one on one situation with him, which i stated at the beginning would really take out the wind in an instant. Your approch is not direct and confrontative but like you said in the beginning, if i may take reference - more receptive. Imagine, while in conversation - you need to focus on asking question. Which questions? Questions which nail him down. Not actually but, questions which will stop his thinking process at a point, where he made or is about to make a statement, an conclusion or whatever you want to call it. (It will not be easy and he will probably figure it out quite as soon as you open your mouth, that something is wrong, that you want to step up. Not easy, cause you will need to come prepared.) The type of the question you ask him is: If he can repeat what he said before or you can also say, that you havent heard him acoustically or even havent understood what he was talking about. The thing is, when he is in position to reframe his thougths, he will also be in selfreflexion-mode and here is where the magic happens and you can decipher on an more emotional, but in the long run also rational way how he is ""Functioning"" - like i mentioned in my opening. The technique, strategy, priciple, which you need to figure out if you really want to have more effectivity.

Remember the hard part is not how you will frame the question to get tim to repeat his action, here you can read a bit on questions on general on the internet... The hard part is that you will need to be able to let him go with his task as uninflucened as possible. Also the others will be a bit disappointet at first or they will feel a slight tension. And this is where you need to do you homework - meaning you gotta know the topics of your group. You will only be able to this indirect interruption to secretly show him his in your words ""bad"" behavior of beeing too dominant and at the same time steel him this ability if you can perform this trick as smooth as possible - meaning you gotta know the topics . or put simply you need to be interessted in whats going on in your group. Read stuff about the things you talk about, inform yourself. Either personal via the media or also just without any intention talk to other people you know. You will get proper information you need to turn the tides and ""calm him down"" a little - if you want to call it this way and here comes my final hint if you can actually and literally can play yourself dumb (without beeing it, cause you got some information and thus you know where the conversation will head after you ""interrupted"", meaning you can smoothly play it out), without really being it.

People love talking about themselves so this will really get the ball going, however sometimes it is up to you to keep the conversation going. At times people feel that other people aren't interested in them or their life so they give little details and end the topic quickly. So it is up to you to ask follow up questions to get them to elaborate.

soc_1379725,socialskills,reddit_comment,173,"Marriage is different than having a boyfriend or a girlfriend.  Yes, take advice from single people or people who's longest committed relationship was 5 years.

But you married this person.

It sounds like he's not being respectful by not communicating his true feelings.  He's trying to make it seem like it would be your choice not to go when in reality, you want to and he doesn't want you to go alone.

From a place of love, reach out to your husband and ask him to say what he really means, and ask him to say it in a loving way.

When that is done, and as long as you are speaking in a candid, vulnerable, trusting, and loving way, you guys can make your own rules on how you want to handle the night, because your entity of marriage will be doing what IT wants.

It's important to pave the way for loving communication early and often and to practice it even when it's hard.

Do what is best for you guys!"
soc_703152,socialskills,reddit_comment,302,"Advice?  I gotchu.

Be prepared to study. Bring ya books, pencils, and anything you got that’s relevant for y’all’s “Study” session. Doing that will not only make it unweird because what if she actually intended on studying? Showing up with nothing will be a red flag, and she’ll prolly think you’re just being thirsty or whatever.


Be prepared for whatever you think is gonna happen. Maybe a Netflix, maybe she just wanna have a deep conversation or maybe she’s just bored and wants to hang out with you.... We all know neither of those are true and it’s you think there will be sex you dirty horny piece of shit.

Alright but forreal. If you think action is gonna go down. Put on some decent casual clothes. Something you’d normally wear to school while not trying hard, make sure your mouth smells great, take a shower, maybe shave down there and be presentable. No girl is gonna kiss onna boul who got stinky breath or smells like sweaty balls on a hot day. That shits a turn off.
Also bringing a condom would be suitable. 

Last but not least. Mindset: go in there with no expectations of sex or anything. If it happens, it happens. If it doesn’t, so be it. Don’t get down if you get no action because a lot of females aren’t like that, and dudes tend to regularly take being nice as “She’s flirting with me” She could genuinely just wanna hang out you feel me. Don’t mess up a potential long term thing by going savage mode soon as you see her lmao.
Let her make the first move whether it’s through body language or words. 

Being prepared for both scenarios makes sure that you leave her house in a very favorable situation. 

Good luck my brother."

Get it in your head that when you think to yourself a false and distorted idea like ""I have low self-esteem,"" you'll believe it.  When you believe it, you base even more irrational beliefs over it, and you live your day battling negative thoughts about everything.

You see, you don't have low self-esteem, you're just overly critical of yourself.  Even though I'm pretty positive you haven't taken the time to do the assignment I gave you, let me give you another one:

Did it ever occur to you that you're just too harsh on yourself? I'm sure you did, but you didn't think about it more than that fleeting second it flashed in your head. 

Imagine a close friend of your's said one of the ""stupid"" things you once said.  You know, saying something so stupid you cringe on his behalf and try to eject from the conversation.  Then say he was to bring it up to you to ask you what you think of it.  Would you ever talk to him as bluntly and harshly as you let yourself think all those horrible thoughts that make you physically cringe?  

Think about it, you communicate with yourself in a way so harsh and inhumane that it elicits a physical reaction, even though the cause is literally in your head, is nonexistent anywhere else. 

Your answer most likely be no.

I dunno man I feel like I'm rambling and losing you.  Anyway, stop thinking in terms of self-esteem.  It's wrong."

Ever since I decided that I would be as authentic as possible and not change myself to please others, I probably annoy more people, but its so much easier to meet people that you truly connect with when you're not constantly trying to twist your own sense of humor just to please them.

Yeah I'd say I definitely have a ""march to the beat of my own drum"" personality, which probably attracts attention from these bullies who don't like people who don't fit their worldview. I am trying to work on ""suppressing/conforming"" my personality in certain social settings.

Your ""friend"" bullied you in a pretty direct and aggressive way. One other form of bullying I struggle with is when I feel like the other person is bullying, but it isn't direct. Things like patting my shoulder when talking to me or referring to me in the 3rd person while in a group aren't directly aggressive. I feel like if I called out the other person on these actions they could easily gaslight me that I'm overreacting since they're not obviously being antagonistic, yet I do know that they are trying to bully me in a high-level way, if that makes sense."

In my case, my pent up emotions were trapped within the tension of my body. By relaxing the tension surrounded the traumatic memory, I was able to let out the emotional pain and process it. Over time, the emotional releases became smaller and less traumatic.

There's a saying that goes, ""You have to feel it to heal it"". What that means is you need to feel the emotional pain that led to the defensive coping behavior. And as you're feeling, you want to let it play itself out, and then use your adult brain to process it and put it into perspective; essentially tell yourself it's alright and you're safe now.

And as you go through this process, you stop thinking about your trauma as this thing that has a hold over you; you realize that the past is the past and it doesn't have to define you."
soc_915719,socialskills,reddit_comment,300,"I think you should distinguish between 1) ""this person feels like this/does this"" and 2) ""this person is having this feeling/doing this deliberately at me.""  The first may or may not be a correct perception of the other person, but let's assume you're right 100% of the time.  The second will still be a wrong perception, almost always.  People have a hundred reasons to be a little less warm than usual or forget to greet someone.  They're stressed, distracted, feeling low, etc., etc.   It's not about you, and yet you take it all personally.  You do not accept interactions that don't go perfectly as you envisioned, so you never get practice in building relationships up.

To get over this, frankly self-centered, view of other people, you will have to stop ruminating.  When those thoughts come up, say ""I don't know why this person acted this way, but I know it wasn't to hurt me,"" and set the thought aside.  You may wish to have a mental box to put such thoughts away - literally, imagine a box, in as much detail as possible, and imagine putting the thought in and closing the lid, even locking it.  

More than that, you will have to make yourself vulnerable at the moment this less-than-perfect interaction happens.  Say hello to people even after they neglected to greet you.  If they don't sound warm, ask them about their troubles.  They may or may not wish to open up to you, but I think you'll find a lot of the time, they become much warmer when you put that small effort in.

Keep also in mind that keeping score like this, being nice only because you expect to get it back, is not actually nice at all.  People can feel falsity in you, too, you know."

The issue is that it's really hard for him to embark on those experiences at this stage of his life as he feels he is behind on what most people consider ""normal"" experiences. His confidence is in the ground and his outlook of himself and on life is very likely to be the source of his issues.

As someone who is in a similar situation and has made progress, you have two solutions. Either be truly ok with your life and go forward looking for people who can understand you and vibe with you...or you can fight and try to create those experiences for yourself. Both cases are going to suck, big time. It's not at all easy. It might also be unlikely that a therapist can help out. At the end of the day, it's your choice.

The reason is because only you know what's going on in your head, and even if I were to be the greatest psychiatrist/psychologist in the world, chances are, you might not believe the things I tell you even if my analysis were perfect. 

The only thing you can really do is ask yourself why. Why do you have these views, why do you want the things you want, why do you feel frustrated when people don't respond the way you want them to. And so on. I think just as far as the ordinary person goes, at our most primitive level we just want to eat, have a sense of community, and - at least while we're still young - have offspring.

You can have social media and always be on it and you can post a lot or you can never be on it and never post or update your status.

soc_718451,socialskills,reddit_comment,345,"Asking questions is likely not the problem. Asking close-ended questions usually is. Open ended questions let the other person keep talking and elaborating on what they truly mean and what they are feeling. You end up learning a lot about the other person, instead of just getting one word responses. Show the other person empathy, be fully engaged in the conversation. Don't think of what to say or reply. Instead get the other person to expand more on what it is you want them to tell you more about. The more you do this the more the conversation will head to more interesting things and ideas. You can learn their motivations, their passions, their thoughts, feelings, likes/dislikes, hobbies. You can find that you share a lot of the same things that this other person likes and engage in those conversations. Most importantly, being more genuinely interested in others and really listening will show the other person you truly care about what they are saying. This will make them more likely to open up to you and to also want to hear your opinions, you ideas, your thoughts. Sometimes even repeating the last few words someone says can help them keep elaborating on what they were talking about. Keep in mind that the thing that most people want to talk about is not surprisingly themselves! So use that to your advantage and let them be able to express themselves more. They will appreciate it and want to talk to you more as well. I've had conversations where I don't really say much, but using this approach i've had them be more interested in me, want to do favors that they usually didn't want to, and genuinely care about how i'm doing or what i'm thinking of. It was a huge shock to me when i started realizing that letting others have someone they can genuinely talk about anything about makes them want to hear you more as well.

I think you have a pretty warped view of these traits, and would do well to recognize that neither is where you want to be. There's nothing wrong with being shy, and weird is hard to call because it's a loaded word that can mean many different things. Why can't you be kind &amp; pleasant?"

soc_178672,socialskills,reddit_comment,281,"This is the right sub.

First, you should decide if you would prefer neither of them going to having them both go in the manner she is suggesting. You want to know this because you want to know the range of possible outcomes before you say something. 

Once you've decided, your choices range from a) doing nothing, and taking the good with the bad, b) continuing to hint at things and hope that she acquiesces (but it sounds like she won't) or c) being direct.

In my opinion, it's better to be direct. Start with compassion, don't make it unnecessarily confrontational, but state your thoughts. If you don't want him to ride with you, then don't. It's your gig, so it's your call. The worst thing that will happen is that neither of them will go.

I must stress that you want to start with compassion. Tell her how important it is that she goes with you, that you really want her to be there, but you aren't close enough with her boyfriend to have him ride with you. You can tailor this to the specifics of the situation, but that's the general idea. 

I wouldn't address the fact that she invited him without asking, because it's pretty hard to uninvite someone after that happens and the most likely outcome is that they'd both bail. You can discuss that later. Yes, she shouldn't have done this, but on the other hand, you should have been sensitive to the fact that she has a boyfriend in the first place. If you didn't want him to get invited, you should have explicitly stated that beforehand. It's water under the bridge at this point."

Something really important to note is that ""being super smart"" or ""having really good ideas"" (according to some sort of measure of ""idea quality"") - has nothing to do with how people feel about you or about an idea.

People's thoughts/feelings about you or your words have much more to do with their internal world than the actual ""objective quality"" of your ideas.

soc_83364,socialskills,reddit_comment,256,"Oh man! It's more normal than you even know! SO so many people go their whole lives feeling awkward and lonely.

Talking with strangers is easy if you can jump into it the right way. It's so easy to fuck up if you don't approach them the right way; you get rejected before you even open your mouth.

But if you know how to talk with people, all people, then you're loved immediately wherever you go. People are just coming to you and inviting you to shit, it's great!

The key, if you want strangers to turn themselves into friends, is to get into the habit of giving instead of taking.

So for example, if you see something that you appreciate about someone, tell them! If they're wearing a cool shirt, or if they said something great in class, or if you like something about them, you just tell them without expecting anything in return.

Another way is to genuinely listen to, and care about people when you talk to them. If you ask someone ""How's it going?"" really care about what they say! Listen to them. If someone knows that they're not being judged, they'll open up to you and tell you what's going on.

Genuinely caring about someone, listening to them, and being honest with them is the absolutely quickest way for strangers to want to be friends with you. You won't even need to do anything else, they'll just seek you out in anyway they can get you.

Engage in proper communication and stop thinking everyone is a fucking racist. Some people do not understand that what they're saying is offensive to some and funny to others.

**You have to be confident and bring positive vibes to your interactions**. Your overall positivity and high energy are what attract people. Consistently lacking in this department will make people avoid you.

**Take initiative and leadership**. Don't wait around for other people to invite you. Why don't you invite them to your own activities ? Instead of texting, why don't you do a Zoom call and invite people to that ? Trust me, a lot of people will remember and appreciate you doing this.

**Make conversations meaningful, memorable, and purposeful**. Don't merely do polite small talk. Exchange ideas, interests, and hobbies with each other. Talk about yourself, and get them to talk about themselves as well !

**Find ways to consistently bring/provide value to other people's lives**. What are your expertise/services ? Offer to use them to help other people. People love it when you contribute to their lives. They look up to you as knowledgeable and wise.

**Don't be needy.** Neediness is repulsive no matter what connection you have with other people. Don't do things such as contacting the same person or few people over and over again out of desperation or thirst. Don't freak out and confront people when they become distant towards you for whatever reason. In general, don't get hung up on one person or a few people.

**You have to be willing to give people space from time to time**. Life will get in the way of your connections and put everything on hold. People are not always going to be available to you. One day, they might respond to your text/call. Another day, these same people won't for whatever reason. When people are distant, remain cool, calm, and collected. Go do your own thing, live your genuinely busy life pursuing your hobbies and goals, and talk to other people on the side. Always keep moving forward. You will earn a lot of respect that way."
soc_196590,socialskills,reddit_comment,301,"Just ignore her for a while, and give her her on treatment.
Silent treatment works pretty well.
Sometimes the other person will calm down and wonder what they did.

There was a guy who lived on the same floor in a uni apartment place with me. He never said a word. If he passed me on the way on the corridor towards the kitchen or vathroom, he pretended to not see me, and never returned a ""hi"" if i greeted him. So i learned to ignore him, and he was nothing t dead air after that.

Now it's getting a bit more frustrating. I recognize people by voice. So when there are occasional people in places that I frequent and that talk with everybody else but not me... Your choice. If people don't want to talk with me, it's ok. Silence has never bothered me, but since I miss the visual nonverbal cues - sorry, it just means you are not there for me to even notice. ""Out of sight, out of mind"". Oh, sorry? Standing right in front of my face silently? Nope, still don't notice you. Try hiding in ""plain sight"", ha ha. (Downside: can't do funny faces or express much emotion because i never know who's around me)

There are so many reasons a person might not like another. Opinions on something, nonverbal (visual) cues, sounds, habits of the other person, or the other person could remind of someone else that was unpleasant. Or they may just avoid talking to the person because they don't want to talk about something that they really want to talk about (in case of shared apartment, things such as cleanliness of common areas, noise levels, leaving that one thing no one but her notices in a way that annoys her OCD etc)."
soc_17798,socialskills,reddit_comment,115,"It's only creepy because you're allowing society to tell you it is creepy. As long as you respect the other person then it's fair to talk in almost any situation. Make sure they are comfortable.

I have chatted with people at grocery stores, on the street, at coffee shops, and other places to prove to myself you can meet anyone anywhere.

Just be respectful, if they aren't in the mood or just want to do their exercise at the gym or whatever, tell them it was nice meeting them and go onto the next person.

I would say the only situation to not talk too much is when you're at work but that's personal preference."

soc_3496,socialskills,reddit_comment,915,"I can’t tell you guys how to just be happy but I can you a few tips that I use every day after having severe depression for my teen years, plus a few after. Anyway here are a few tips:

*Set goals - Have an idea of what you want. Want to lose 10 lbs? Win a marathon? You have to take a first step regardless of what your goal is. If you want to run a 10K and the first day you only walk 1 mile then guess what? That is still 1 mile more than you walked yesterday. Set a goal for every day, no matter how small. Accomplish something so you can say you have done something that day, or as I say build momentum.

*Monitor your self-talk. Confidence is key - Use words and phrases like ""I can"" and ""I will"" instead of ""I can't"" or ""I'd like to."" Speak and think like you will accomplish a goal and surprisingly you will easier than just wishing you would. If you take on a goal with the mindset that you WILL accomplish it, then you will most likely achieve your goal. You need to be confident, not an egotistical ass that thinks because he has a penis he's the greatest gift to the world.

*Be honest with yourself - If you had a shit day and just want to chill and watch bad movies and throw a few beers back then go for it, but don't make it an everyday thing. Get back on that horse tomorrow, just keep building that momentum. Everyone needs to rest and reflect. It helps you learn and grow.

*Try. Give it your all - Here is why I am so focused on pushing myself. Four years ago I was a senior in high school getting those little brochures from schools like West Point and Brown University. My test scores always hit the roof but I never applied myself because high school sucks ass so my GPA dropped two whole points from my freshman to junior year. I decided instead to enlist the military. It was the best decision I ever made. Gave me stability and a standard to live up to. Now if I had applied myself I could have gone to Brown University and been the class of 2012. Now who else went to Brown U in that time? A miss Emma Watson. I could have gone to school with Emma fucking Watson. This shit pisses me off because I didn't take an opportunity and could have had a completely different experience in life because I didn't apply myself and just try. I missed an opportunity because I failed to apply myself. I would have met Emma Watson if I tried. In no way do I regret the path I have chosen because of who I am today which leads me to my next point.

*Accept your failures and learn from them - I honestly do not understand why people search for a meaning to life. I don't know why I am here and I don't care. I am here. I am me. What can I do? What do I want to do? You are going to try to meet a goal and eventually you will not. You can dwell on it or, and this is a big OR, you can move on, see what went wrong, and try again. Think of how many times it took Edison to create a light bulb. He refused to quit. Now he's dead and people still know who he is because he did not let his failures define him, he defined them and learned from them to meet his goal.

*Don't quit - It's a simple as that. Don't quit. Don't ever quit. Don't ever think about quitting. You might want to quit. Things might not be going the best but you cannot ever quit. Life never goes to plan so prepare to face the unexpected.

*Love yourself and others -I'm not talking about that bullshit Hollywood running through an airport to catch someone. Hell, everyone has a cell phone these days, just call them because you'd never get past security anyways. I'm talking about a basic, low level, background noise type of love. Help an elderly person with groceries, pull over for a stranger stranded on the side of the road. SHOW COMPASSION. Give others the smallest act of kindness because you do not know how it will affect them. It could save their life, it sure saved mine. Basically a stranger to me bared her heart and soul in front of about 90 people about she had been sexually abused by someone close to her. Through her my mind was set in motion. I asked myself why I was miserable, why am I living the lonely, fruitless life I was and I could not come up with an honest answer. She set off a spark in me that is now a roaring fire...sounds really cliché but I have energy flowing out my arse now.

Laugh when you do something stupid, help others when they're down. Be yourself but first find out who you are and what you are made of (mettle because I like that word). Try. Don’t quit. Smile and have fun. I can't guarantee this will work for you because it is up to you to take that first step. You are here, no one is stopping you. So what are you waiting for?

soc_483574,socialskills,reddit_comment,420,"This is a perfect example of why its a bad idea to go into a discussion just expecting the other guy to wholesale accept and praise you for being right. You tend to disregard what the other guy says, missunderstand it, and then be no better off at the end of it.

Because if you're right, then you're the same fool that started the discussion. You've probably also alienated the other guy with your shenanigans as you attempt to ignore parts of his arguments for your own convenience. If you're wrong, you've robbed yourself of improving your understanding of it, and then becoming slightly less of a fool. 

I've told you what I agree about, what I dont, and why I dont. What you do with that is up to you.

But it was interesting to hear your thoughts.  I do not agree with truth relativism, your most topics dont have a clear truth statement, one bit since you are confusing the concept of truth with the concept of understanding. Objective truths clearly exist, otherwise our world would fall apart at the seams, but having a philosophical discussion on knowledge would take weeks of discussions. First I'd have to get a grasp of what your understanding of it is. Then I'd have to go get the sources, you too. Then we have to both engage those honestly for weeks on end. Maybe at the end we will both have a slightly better understanding of it but it is not something I can afford right now.

But sharing and comparing understandings is something you can always do. Just be careful of people that are doing it dishonestly. You should stop trying as soon as they start pulling shenaningans if you value the relationship. Because they will get angry and burn the relationship to the ground in a vain attempt to be ""right"" and damn the consequences.

They'll ignore what you say and reply something like this: 
&gt; Fine. Ignore the advice then.

I'm sure you can see how this can alienate people if you go into discussions trying to be right all the time. Other people will simply stop trying to engage you. That is how you rob yourself of the opportunity to improve your understanding on important things with the help of your social network.

If you paid any attention to what I wrote then you'd know that I didnt ignore your advice. I took it seriously and made an honest reply on it. You've written what you are doing. "

That said it is a little odd that you guys discuss your height in relation to each other so often, but who am I to judge something like that? The best advice I could give is to simply not engage when your brothers get argumentative about each other’s height, and maybe mention that wearing lifts to make yourself look taller is only acceptable if your name is Tom Cruise and just leave it at that? Having an argument with my friends or even my siblings about height is such a foreign concept to me, so that’s the best I’ve got.

soc_640606,socialskills,reddit_comment,375,"Honestly, I can kinda relate to this. My inability to share and show my emotions and feelings was never this bad, but I always had trouble with it, especially during my childhood. I was always very shy and I separated myself from everyone. Nobody really seemed to like me since I was antisocial, so my ""friends"" drifted away from me; they couldn't accept me for who I was. Not only did I have trouble with making friends, but it was also difficult to interact with girls. I could never muster up the courage to talk to them. And I even heard one time some girls saying I was ""ugly"" or some shit like that. Things like that killed any level of self-esteem I had and drove me deep into depression. But anyways, that's kinda besides the point. What I'm trying to say is that through these experiences and the way I grew up, I became an outcast and I could hardly ever share or show my emotions to anyone. Not even my own family. To this day, I don't think my parents know about the depression I experienced as a kid. They never saw me crying myself to sleep. As the years passed, I taught myself to be more open by simply being honest with myself and just going for it. The first step in forming a relationship with someone is to just go over and talk to them. Do or say whatever comes to mind. Four years ago, I met a guy who eventually became my best friend and he really helped me open up. He showed me that I could trust him. We both bonded over each other's pain and secrets. We just have so much in common.
My advice is pretty simple. In situations like this, go over to someone and do whatever you think they'd want or say whatever you think they'd want to hear. I'm pretty sure you know plenty about your family, so you should appeal to their personality and go on from there. Take a chance, mate. You won't get anywhere if you don't take a chance. Maybe you can practice with your friends or something. Train yourself to open up and demonstrate empathy. I hope this helps"
soc_1731647,socialskills,reddit_comment,239,"I agree that therapy is going to be invaluable to you. I experienced emotional instability coming out of an abusive relationship and found that simply being in a safe space and bring heard allowed my brain room to process emotions.

But apart from therapy, I would recommend the following immediate actions you can take in those moments:

- Hug yourself. Literally. I forgot where I read this but it is science that when you wrap your arms around yourself in a self-embrace it releases certain chemicals in your brain that can help you calm down and or feel better. Try it. It’s great :) one hand across the chest grabbing your shoulder, the other hand crossing your chest grabbing the other. Maybe rub your hands up and down your shoulders. Stay there for as long as you need.
- Verbal affirmations: say em in your head, say em out loud, write them down, type them. Whatever. “I am allowed to feel this way. My feelings are valid. This made me upset and that makes sense. How I feel is normal and it will pass.” (Not verbatim but things like this. Your feelings are valid!)
- Journal! Writing pen and paper, typing, dictating into a voice note. Whatever works for you. Give your brain an outlet for all of those emotions. The good and the bad. 

You got this, my friend. But definitely look into therapy :) Rooting for you!"
soc_1516876,socialskills,reddit_comment,1009,"I come across as a decently social person. People typically like me when they first meet me. As they get to know me better, the majority tend to dislike me and the few who don't tend to become friends. I don't know how normal this is, but it's always been my situation. I think it's probably pretty normal to the process of making friends but I'm not sure.  


Anyway, I used to have a lot of social anxiety around this. I will tell you how I got over that but I don't know if this is good advice for everyone.   


First, the reason people tend to like me in the beginning is that I'm very private and I don't want attention, but I need something to say and some way to act when I'm in a situation in which I must interact with others. Because this does not come natural to me, I studied it very early on in high school. The solution is very simple actually. You focus on breathing and standing without fidgeting. You make decent eye contact. You ask the other person a lot of questions about themselves and you listen to them talk about themselves while nodding and saying things like ""wow that's interesting"" or whatever thing is appropriate to what they say. People love to talk about themselves and they like people who let them talk about themselves. You do not think about how you come across at all and you do not attempt to show yourself in any way. Just ask questions and listen to them. If they ask questions about you, you keep it simple and impersonal without being evasive. I have a typical ""gist"" that I give about my life (where I live, what I do, etc) and I give no details about myself beyond that. When there is a lull in the conversation or you feel the other person might not wish to continue talking about themselves, then you shift the conversation to the topic that brought you together in the first place (like if it's a work situation then what the work is, if it's a hobby situation, then the activity you are doing together, if it's a social situation or a chance meeting in public then usually the immediate setting works.)  


These tips will get you through basically any social, hobby or work interaction in a way that makes people like you in an informal and casual way. If you are actually seeking friendship or you need to have a real in depth conversation beyond that, then you move on to number two.  


Second- you will never see most people you meet again. No big deal. You have to work on yourself not caring about that. If you are in a scenario in which you do see the person again, you have to decide if you like them enough or if you are compatible with them enough to actually pursue a real friendship. I've found that if I'm really honest about this, then I only actually like most people to the extent that we do things together or have a shared interest. I don't really want to know them as an intimate friend. Therefore, I just do the steps listed up in number one again but in more depth. Ask them more about themselves, take an interest in their lives, but mostly I focus on the thing we are doing together. Hobbies or work usually. Most people will ask you questions about yourself too, and if you keep your answers brief and don't go into too much detail, you will fall into an easy rhythm and the friendship is mostly focused on whatever common interest you have. This is also a good way to avoid drama and burn out.  


Every once and a while, someone like this will turn out to be someone I really genuinely like, and then I will slowly start to open up to them and be more natural around them. I'm old enough that I can tell you with certainty that around the 6-8 month mark, every single person I get to know like this is suddenly surprised by something I do which seems really intense to them. The intensity of my opinions about things or else the fact that I do things which are outlier behaviors (apparently) or the intensity of my emotions, whatever. It's always fascinating to me because I will tell people anecdotes before then about things that have happened in the past and they laugh and tell me I'm funny and that they like my attitude and sense of humor, but then when they are in a scenario in which that is put into action for the first time, they are always surprised. At this point, most people stop hanging out with me. This used to really bother me and I'd lay awake at night thinking through the scenario over and over again trying to figure out what I did wrong and how to handle it better. But then around my mid 20s I just realized that the friends I did have were very good solid friendships with lots of reciprocation and trust, so I decided I'd rather have a handful of those than a big social group. Since then, I've just accepted that most people won't like me as much as they get to know me and I'm more selective about who I let get that close and likewise I expect that many will not like me after that 6-8 month mark. The ones who do become intimate lifelong friends.  


In short- number one gets me through casual interactions which are most of them, number two gets me to real friendship though it is often awkward and I accept some level of rejection. Having this strategy and making peace with the rejection have solved the anxiety problem with regards to talking to people.

When I or other Indians say you look cute like a something it's usually they perceive them to resemble that thing.

soc_516544,socialskills,reddit_comment,206,"It seems like he's stuck in the ""acquaintance zone"" when he should be a little more in synch with you and at least some of your other friends by now...
So, you need to decide whether he's a friend or a friendly acquaintance.
If he's a not a friend, then it's ok to let it fizzle regardless of how nice he is. He should have a vague idea of where he stands within your social circle.

If you do see him as a friend (which seems likely to me given you care about him enough to pose this question and he has been happy to attend your shindigs for years) then you need to accept him for who he is REGARDLESS of what your other friends may think of him or help him with this problem

I reckon there's a good chance he's not being ""real"" or at least a little more forthcoming with his actual self to you and your friends, which is why you're not gelling. Push him out of his comfort zone next time and see how he reacts. I think he would value how caring and kind a person can be, but not how ""nice"" they are. Niceness is a social veneer."

I was trying to help this girl out earlier who lives in LA. She claims she's an ex-lingerie model who looks like a curvier Megan Fox, graduated in a STEM field, and now has a high-paying job in healthcare. She's been on the subreddit for about two years now and as such now has a history: Why do my relationships with men never work? Implicitly her language puts the fault on all of the men. She's gotten so desperate, in fact, that her recent post was asking whether she should consider lowering her standards to men who are chronically unemployed or who make less then $5,000 a year (which is a personal preference you need to determine for yourself). 

  
So I put it forward to her: If everyone's the asshole except for you, maybe it's worth considering that you might actually be the one to be the asshole?...  


*''No, I'm the nicest person. I work in healthcare''.*

Think about it: You can't hold down a relationship, you always go on about how beautiful you are, how you used to be an ex-lingerie model, how you're curvy and look like Megan Fox, you always focus on your accolades (and never your flaws). And you're based in LA of all places. I don't know a single bad thing about you! Tell me one flaw about yourself. You want to know why your relationships never work despite you claiming you've dated every type of guy out there and that looks don't matter to you? The issue here has to be your personality. You're most likely a narcissist.   


*''No, I know I said I'm beautiful, but by LA standards I'm more like a 7, so people have never praised me or told me I'm beautiful throughout my life. Being beautiful is just a normalcy here so I've never been made to feel beautiful so obviously I can't be a narcissist''.*   


So you were a lingerie model in LA, but nobody ever validated you for your beauty and made you feel like the modelling industry was something that would appeal to you?...  


*''Correct''*.   


Girl, you still haven't given me a single flaw about yourself. That would be really helpful here.

She's doomed because nobody can help her but herself, and she doesn't want to help herself. "
soc_75581,socialskills,reddit_comment,215,"When I'm at a bar or a social scene and I'm talking to someone who has completely different tastes and likes than me, I'll ask questions about what it is they do. I think eye contact and a nice smile is enough for them to open up to you and realize that you are being a genuine character with honest intentions - once you get people to realize that, conversations tend to lift off. That's just my personal experience. 

I tend to be quite a moody person, however. So some days I'll be at the bar without any desire to go out there and socialize. But other times when I truly feel like talking to people I tend to be the type of person who will have an amazing conversation with almost anybody, regardless of commonalities. 

Edit: One thing I've noticed is that you almost have to sell yourself when meeting people. You have to instantly (within the first few seconds) let them know that you offer something genuinely fascinating to a conversation. It's just human nature to make an instant impression, so even if you're open minded and willing to connect with people, you have to be energetic and show true interest in not only what you say, but what others say as well."

What I did that made us friends is I usually just kinda watch then quietly and i observe them. This dude named Nathaniel loves drawing and painting. So whenever I pass by his area and see him doodling, I ask him about it like “What’s that?” and he usually gets surprised and says “Nothing. It’s just a drawing.” And I’d start the conversation there. I would compliment his art and say how he could be an amazing artist/painter. I ask him how he learned to draw, what inspired him to continue drawing, where does he learn to draw, does he use expensive art materials or not? I just ask anything art related and he usually brightens up and seems more confident since it’s something he knows; it’s a known and familiar area to him and makes him forget about his social anxiety. He doesn’t make eye contact with me though, which I understand, but it’s so nice to see him talk confidently.

tl;dr learn about their interests (i dont recommend specific shows like Avengers since you wont really get much to talk about) and ask them things about. They’ll slowly warm up to you and boom you’ll have a friend with social anxiety and they’re surprisingly very friendly :))"
soc_1248,socialskills,reddit_comment,569,"Yeah, attitude is another discussion entirely and difficult to sum up without sounding condescending (""it's all in your mind blah blah *punch* ow ow ow""). Bear in mind that I'm no social genius; just a guy trying to get better and having enough success to share a few ideas.

Something I see discussed a lot regarding confidence is how difficult it is to ""fake it until you make it"", and that's very true. It feels like lying in a lot of ways, and it's incredibly difficult to do when you first start off, but like any skill, it gets easier the more you do it, and eventually it turns into legit confidence. Not so much the cheesy bravado kind of confidence; that just annoys people. But that sense of feeling relaxed in your environment, like you belong there, and you're at least moderately comfortable in your own skin, that's the kind of ""attitude"" you want to work toward and convey to others. It makes you approachable without giving the impression that you're trying too hard to fake it to the point where your efforts go over the top and backfire. I realize this is more of a general life thing than a simple incidental social interaction thing, but hear me out.

When you first start talking to strangers, it's going to be awkward, there's no way around that. This is why I advocate these sorts of ""pointless"" interactions with people you're unlikely to see often or ever again, because they're really not pointless at all; they're good practice, and a lot of fun even in the beginning. You start feeling like you're making progress. People you see often, like the hot dog vendor, start to remember you, and that paves the way for better conversations.

Getting back to attitude, it helps to know exactly how you want to be perceived by others. It gives you something to work on, and once you internalize it and make it who you are, it feels less like you're putting up a front and more like this whole ""being yourself"" business that gets thrown around like it's really that easy. Once you have the outward conveyance down, people start treating you as if your relaxed confidence is legit, and isn't that most of the point? :) Eventually that attitude transitions into the real thing and you don't even have to try anymore to maintain it. I still have a lot of work to do on myself, but I find myself having to ""try"" a lot less now.

As far as interactions being detrimental, you'd be amazed just how rare that actually is. As long as you're not being rude, other people can handle someone being a little awkward, it's not like they're going to rip you a structurally-superfluous new behind just for not being The Fonz. It may not be the best first impression, but if it's someone you never see again, no harm done. If it's someone you end up seeing a lot, you make up for it later, and assuming they even maintained their impression of you (also rarer than we think it is) they'll eventually warm up to you as you make progress and think ""huh, maybe this dextroverted character is cooler than I thought"".

tl;dr: get to know yourself, how you want to be and be perceived, and remember that this is a marathon and not a sprint. :)"

I experienced an overwelming amount of death and it actually caused me to be diagnosed with PTSD, which i was treated for, so i can relate. I think that instead of worrying about these deaths affecting your social behaviors, focus on taking care of yourself first and everything will fall into place. Everyone experiences grief differently and thats ok and perfectly normal for you to go through the stages in your own way. Find healthy ways to cope, build a strong support system, and think of maybe seeing a therapist to help sort through your emotions. Death is a normal but a very painful part of life. Its hard to accept. Dont be hard on yourself,  youre human. You are entitled to not be functioning at your full potential right now. You've been through multiple tradgedies and you're hurting. Stop apologizing, you have nothing to apologize for. Little by little you will find your happiness again, i promise. Dont try to bury or run away from your emotions. You have to go through it to get through it. I promise you will be ok. Sending lots of love your way, you are stronger than you think."
soc_966932,socialskills,reddit_comment,695,"Having a blanket rule for anyone even remotely aware they are upset disclose their emotional state to someone they meet up with can seem so much more complicated in practice.

Let's take a look at this in an example.

Let's think of the upset person with their touchey emotional state as having a sprained ankle. An upset person would prefer to stay home than to meet up with a person, but as adults, they've committed to a prior obligation and find themselves facing someone with their fragile state of mind / ""sprained ankle"".

Now, having Mr. out-of-touch suddenly grab you and insist on doing sprints with him, or worse, ridicule you for having a damaged ankle, is catastrophic. Mr. Out of touch?
In an undesirable scenario, someone ""out of touch"" could be taken aback and lack the appropriate empathy to manage someone's up-front ""upset""/emotional state. 
I'd like to think that we all know this kind of interaction, it feels invalidating, especially so if we aren't even at the point of ""acknowledging"" our own turmoil yet (as others have pointed out in this thread).

Whether this reflects on the out-of-touch person's general way of thinking, or their particular train of thought, in that moment - on that day, it's important to put yourself in the shoes of the person walking into the conversation ""upset"".

People need time to process. They aren't robots. It's reasonable for them to walk into an interaction and understand that the ""something-elusive"" they are being bothered by, may only benefit from clueing in the person they are meeting in a kind of best-case-scenario.
And again, that's if, a big IF, they are even aware of why they are upset.

The chances of someone knowing what they are feeling are no different than the chances of someone observing and recognizing the person they met is acting upset for reasons unrelated to the interaction. If one person takes the ONUS for caring for the other person's mental and emotional needs, wouldn't it make more sense for it to be the person that's not strained with an upset mental state?

What I'm trying to say is, if you would find things easier for you for upset people to acknowledge the source of their feelings, can't you also acknowledge that people sometimes bring unrelated emotional baggage into an interaction that doesn't reflect on you?

Ninja edit: that best-case scenario I mentioned, the best case scenario for a person with an upset or fragile mental state to clue in a person they met is probably going to be when that other person is also NOT distracted, if that person is naturally empathetic, and if their relationship is even the type that warrants that kind of consideration. THEN they might find the care and support they need.
That's tricky, because what they need depends on them, not their state of being upset. Everyone is different, so one upset person might need to vent, another person might need to change the subject, another person might want consteucti e advice, and other might not need to talk about it then and there.

That's not to say a stranger can't pick up the signals and step in selflessly to find what the upset person needs. The person might recognize this upset person is upset but pick up that it wouldn't be appropriate for them to chime in about it. It's not personal.

Tldr;
Being able to read another's emotional state is as difficult as it is to read your own emotional state.
Someone caught in the turmoil of their upset mind might not yet recognize that they are upset, let alone communicate that to someone they run into.

Wouldn't the better solution be to try to hone in on other people's emotional needs, and if you notice your friend or partner is distracted or acting upset, to *ask them or call them out*?
E.g. ""hey, you seem kind of different today, is everything alright? You don't have to tell me about it, I'm just concerned.""

Kindness goes a long way. That mental pressure you feel from your upset friend is a signal for you to act, should you accept the challenge."
soc_1532286,socialskills,reddit_comment,270,"sometimes I feel like I get socially in the zone. It happened to me before, when I would initiate conversations or I would get out of my comfort zone. Then yoh realize people also want to talk, who doesnt like a friendly conversation, really. Like try to talk to strangers (depending the circumstances of course) like they are your friend even if they are not. More likely then not they will apteciate your openness and share personal experience as well. Realize how much you care about an other person looking unsecure or weird and how fast you forget about it even if you think about it. Most of the time you realize you dont care at all. Same goes for other people even your family, everybody only cares about themselves really. And if they criticize you its usually only a reflection of their own state of being, not yours. What I'm saying is live is short and we will all die and we all just want to meet people and be happy. Just go out and comment on things or make a remark, that way you will see if a person is interested to talk or not. Now that I poured my heart out I wish you all the best and the reason because I wrote this is not because I care about you, but rather because it makes me feel good about myself giving this advice, see I dont care either. Its your life and only you live it and experience it, its all up to you, lets get proactive and start living life with peace and happiness :))))))"
soc_938466,socialskills,reddit_comment,115,"I'm pretty sure I'm the one reaching out first in about 90% of my friendships and acquaintances and it used to upset me too. I'd give everyone the silent treatment just to test who'd reach out. But as I get older, in honesty, I just don't feel like being petty and spiteful at my own expense. When I want to communicate something to someone, I'll do it, even if it's a double text on my side or whatever. When I want interaction, I'll get it. No second guessing, because it won't affect anyone but me. I do want people to care about me, but I want more to care about people. If that makes sense."
soc_1403650,socialskills,reddit_comment,1085,"Traditionally, that is around the age to where most people socialize, mingle and gain many of their social skills and habits. Fall in with one group and you start doing X, fall in with another and you start doing Y. Normally, most adults make friends at the places they work at, then by extension get introduced to some of their friends- from outside the work place. Thus your circle expands. I, myself, have fallen in and out with many friend groups and social settings over the years. Every so often I’ll pick up a friend or two that stick with me throughout the duration of a few friend groups. I’ve have a couple friends that I’ve had since childhood, but we barely speak anymore. They’ve moved off, or I’ve moved off- and we’re all living our own lives, doing our own things. When you’re young, having a large group of friends can seem priority numero uno- for others, they seem not to care one bit. Some people are built different, so the insight people have on life will be just as varied. No one way of living is the correct way, but I do acknowledge that for some, they need certain things to maintain balance. 

When you’re young, you naturally want to socialize- one theory is- is that humans are evolutionarily hardwired to have social interactions as a catalyst for tapping into the greater collective wisdom congregations have. We do this so that we may learn about our environments, and how to interact with it. The knowledge helps us learn by other peoples examples. Its basically just a survival mechanism. 

Since we have fair-ish life spans, the successive generations grow and adapt to the environments of their time- something that’s made us so versatile and able to adapt(ice age/famines/wild animals), as well as something that’s made us fervent and neurotic(wars/subjugation/ mental illness). 

So while you’re growing up, maturing and getting all those new life experiences, no matter how mundane- it will inadvertently and irrevocably, morph and mold you into someone new. You’ll barely even notice it at times. 

One thing I frequently try to remind myself, besides keeping things short😅, is that pick any aspect of you. Your political beliefs, religious, your fears and concerns, irritations, stresses, hopes, dreams, understandings, yearnings and loves- each and everyone of those are nothing more than a mere aspect, a sliver, of who you are. “For I am man, and I contain multitudes.” You are the composite image of all those things. You see people clinging to the titles, cliques, and teams- they allow something that is only an aspect, to consume their very being, adopting all means of characteristics. They restructure their lives to conform to what their understanding of a person dedicated to this aspect ought to be. They lose sight of themselves. Humans are social chameleons, we generally tend to match the traits of those around use in our social spheres.

There’s a phrase in law- I’m gonna butcher this because I forgot the phrase, but it was something like “inclusio una, exclusio alterum. Include one, exclude the rest.”

By absorbing and dedicating your time to any one pursuit in life- you thereby exclude yourself from doing any of the other endless possibilities during that time. Cause sadly, the one thing we have next to none of- is time. Side note, Dr Phil(yeah, I know) once said “ that no matter what you do, whether you spend this next upcoming year doing something to actively improve your lot in life, or do something to actively destroy it- this next year is going to come and go regardless. You just have to determine if you want to be in a better place, or worse place, this time next year.” Kinda in your face obvious- but it does help to just hear things like that, said allowed(typed). That’s a huge benefit to being around people. You glean some of their collective wisdom.

This life, and this world- they’re fucking beautiful, and it’s an incredible adventure. It’s also a dangerous one. A life wrought with many pits and folly, attempting to bear down and  ensnare you. This means you need to keep your wits about you. When you find yourself stressed, depressed or lonesome- remind yourself of the limitless and unbridled potential of what humans are capable of. We are an incredible species preforming incredible tasks, all the while with the ridiculous ability to comprehend our places in life. To remember our places amongst this world, it’s inhabitants, and the point and period of our place in time. Cognition alone is, dare I say- miraculous.

I once heard a saying, “life without friends, is like a long journey with no inns,” can’t remember the origins, but basically meaning that while you’re grinding through life, you need time to decompress care relax- and to tend to your own needs. Friends have historically been a means to help decompress, relax, and to help keep the ole noggin’ in tune with the benefits of having social groups. They can also be a burden. Selective friends is important, but it should happen organically. It’s also important that not all friendships that can happen organically- shoulda it’s up to you to discern the difference.

Allll this said, you honestly don’t need many friends. One, two, or even four is probably enough. Remember, friends should be 100% about quality, not quantity. Anything beyond that, it’s quickly becomes a matter of time management and prioritization. How many people will you actually have time to hang out with anyways, while still tending to your own needs? While you might tend to a friends needs- you can’t always rely on the to tend to yours. Self responsibility and account come into play here.

Sorry for the long ass ramble but had a few minutes and wanted to write something. Just wrote more than I had intended. 

Sincerely wish you all the best as you fumble your way through life. Enjoy it!!

P.S. sorry for not proofreading. Too much and I don’t wanna bother

P.P.S covid is also playing into a fair bit of isolation for many people, dunno if this impacts you directly- but it impacts everyone indirectly. You’re just 21, so 19 at the onset of the pandemic. Life was drastically different pre-lockdowns. So you’re experiencing a different social climate than I did at your age. Take everything with a grain of salt and use all the extra “you” time to learn some shít and improve yourself."
soc_94067,socialskills,reddit_comment,314,"&gt; Imagine if a complete stranger came up to you, introduced herself and started talking about the weather or something...

I've had that happen quite often actually haha.

Anyways, you shouldn't worry about exactly what you're going to say. Just focus on finding out more about her, finding what you have in common. What she does, who she is, how she thinks and feels.

And this has something that's come up a lot in these comments and it shows a failure on my part to explain how much of a numbers game dating is.

To be frank, you're probably going to crash and burn. How much of your life have you spent talking to women with the intent of asking them out? Less than an hour total?

Would you expect someone picking up a pool stick for the first time to be able to pull off amazing trickshots and score when it should be impossible? No.

The goal is to not care if she says no, to recognize that if one amazing girl says no, that there are literally billions more out there waiting for you to talk to them, and that no matter who you are, plenty will want you for you. In doing this, you remove women from the pedestal you've put them on and treat them like people. Because they are.

I struggled with depression and anxiety for years before I did something about it. Basically, I got a job in customer service to get better at talking to people at all, then I focused on girls. I started going out 4-5 nights a week and just meeting women. I made a rule to myself that I'd talk to 10 girls a night. Getting rejected &gt;40 times a week kills your fear of rejection hard. In addition, one would say yes, so I'd end up on a new date every week."
soc_1214903,socialskills,reddit_comment,205,"I second you. Such friends got me into a life altering accident with their irresponsibility. I would never hang around drunkards who try to force you into their behavior. I had to curtail many of my life goals due to their antics. While I will no doubt fight on, thanks to God's and my parents blessings, I wouldn't have faced any of it, if I didn't have irresponsible, selfish ""friends"" who were totally caught up in the booze culture. Stay far far away from such idiots. Cut them away if you must. 

Mind you, when stuff happens, these aforesaid friends will dump you and run far far away. Just stay focused on your goals, away from these drunkards and be crystal clear, that your life, your health matter to you more than such transitory ""friends"" who are likely too immature to even care about the excellent decision you've made. The insults they are using against your decision are not acceptable either. They are literally pressurising you to do something that you decided you wouldn't do. The same kind of pressure will be used against you when you are in a weak frame of mind, and if you crack, you'll be in trouble. Take care, disassociate."
soc_770223,socialskills,reddit_comment,180,"Good, you need to give your goals to achieve. You want build habits to achieve these goals. 

 you need to build a plan. You first need to know what triggers your out of control feelings. Once you understand those you start  by trying different ways to stabilize yourself. Like exercise or different types of music. It would depend on the situation you are in and how to handle it. Remember You know yourself best. Also if it doesn't work out every time know it's okay to be frustrated but you  don't want to give you. Be confident you'll find away.

With procrastination. It about time management. Everyone is different so people study 30 minutes and play 30 minutes. Others do better with 2 hours and 2 hours. The trick is being disciplined enough to do it because you have built the habit. I recommend studying for an hour and doing something you want after or and hour on and hour off.  Do this every day. It's not something you just pick up out of nowhere. Better yet set a time"
soc_311354,socialskills,reddit_comment,120,"See it from their perspective. If your teacher walked up to you and did that it would freak you out. Your brain would automatically sound alarm bells to stay away from the person. You're violating social norms with your eye contact and lack of reason to talk (you don't know each other). To talk to strangers, you need to start with a conversation point, e.g. comment on the lesson, ask whether they found the exam difficult, etc.

On the other hand it's find to say hello if they are by themselves and you walk in, but not in groups since you're violating their private conversation. Of course it's on you to continue the conversation and make it interesting and engaging."
soc_399937,socialskills,reddit_comment,287,"I used to be in a similar situation like you. I had very few friends, low confidence, no gf and so on. I've improved since then a lot. What really helped right from the start was nofap. No kidding. I was a heavy porn addict and getting away from that shit helped me a lot to gain more confidence and become a more stable person. So if you feel like you have a problem with porn, then carry on with your nofap. My second advice is: healthy lifestyle. Gym, regular sleep schedule, healthy food, all of that can improve your confidence and help you gain a lot of energy for the day. I also recommend meditation a lot. It clears your mind and decreases your stress levels throughout the day. After you've taken care of these things, the next step is to go out and meet new people. The best thing you can do is to meet someone with a lot of empathy for you. My sister introduced me to one of her friends who understands me. She has a lot of empathy for others and always helps those who need it. Since then she has helped me to meet more people and make more friends. I still have no gf, though. I'm still working on that one. But remember that Tinder is more for short\-term relationships so I don't think that's gonna help you a lot. If you want to hear more from me, either my story or my advices, feel free to message me. I won't judge you for anything. I've been there. I know how hard your path is.

soc_977024,socialskills,reddit_comment,627,"I don't think it's necessarily done to create an aura of enigma or to justify toxic behaviour.

I think that some people, serious personality or not, can be very unlucky with the people they meet, and they don't have the same social skills or confidence as someone like yourself does to own it without getting themselves into trouble.

For instance, if you were feeling insecure, you might say something like, ""people tend to break up with me"" even if you knew full well it was them who were the toxic or insecure ones, because all but the most obvious forms of toxic behaviour can be justified to members of the public, and it can be very hard to convince other people that a problem is either due to a personality clash or a misunderstanding or due to the other person being in the wrong when everyone is on the opposite person's side and make it look as if you are the one in the wrong.

I also think that some ""toxic"" behaviours that really are a person's responsibility aren't easily solved, because the issue isn't being toxic, but how the person is perceived and taken. To use an extreme example, if you constantly face sexism with different people because you're a woman, it may be a ""you"" problem in that they wouldn't judge you if you weren't a woman, but it's obvious that it's them who shouldn't be sexist towards you, rather than you who needs to pretend to be a man or a submissive woman.

To use a more realistic example, in my case, I have a loud voice, and some people are intimidated by that. This isn't something that's a crucial part of my identity, or would be unrealistic or impossible to change, and it's not a bigoted prejudice, so that makes me toxic, right? 

Except that there are other people who have no problem with hearing me speak at a higher volume, and don't take it as a sign that I'm trying to intimidate them. So, I *could* talk at a lower volume, and probably should, since it's a toxic trait overall (although to be honest, I struggle with doing that), but there are other, similar things that people will judge me for which aren't really toxic at all, like having curly hair, or things might be bad but that they take the wrong way, like making assumptions about me because of how I breathe as an asthmatic or carry my things as a dyspraxic.

Eventually, I have to decide whether it's really worth changing these parts of me or not - whether the thing that people feel is toxic is harmful or scary to people, and thus worth changing (even though it has no bearing on my personality or ethics), or whether it's nothing to concern myself about and shouldn't be something I should have to concern myself with just because some people take an issue with it (like my hair).

I imagine there are also things that might not be anyone's fault, but attract the wrong sort of responses. At that point, one can either decide to adapt how one acts in order to avoid a negative response, or continue the same way because the negative response is wrong. For instance, if people judge you for what you wear, you can either reluctantly decide to wear something different, which will prevent the negative response, or continue wearing the same things, because it isn't your fault.

I imagine that this is probably a dilemma that a lot of people have to put up with; for instance, if someone smokes or is overweight, is that something toxic they need to change, or something that's their own personal decision and other people should deal with?"
soc_139735,socialskills,reddit_comment,211,"Honestly, just talk to women with an open mind? I know if for whatever reason me and another woman are only discussing one or two topics (like dating and shopping I guess?) then it's because we are acquaintances, maybe don't like each other too much and very much want to keep it that way. Perhaps you're giving off a vibe that you're uncomfortable or possibly judging them and it makes other women just not want to bother opening up to you. Most women I know, whether they're friends with me or not, have pretty biting wit and are capable of some messed up humor beyond whatever proper feminine attitude they might portray. I even have a few friends who are very feminine and... gentle I suppose, but they can handle me alright even if they're slightly horrified/embarrassed by half the shit I say. 

I mean I can't imagine you go through some special ritual of masculinity and sarcasm to be friends with guys. You just talk to them right? Do that with women and eventually you will find friends. Everyone is different and there is no magic formula to clicking with people. You just have to be open to it and not shy away just because they appear different from you.

I would suggest just being there for her in other ways until she opens up to you. Maybe bring home her favorite snack, or offer to watch a movie with her in silence.

I moved to a different state several years ago away from a bad situation. I was at low point with no friend circle. Then I found a program and it helped me approach people and become more outgoing which lead to more friends. Learning about social interaction is doing socializing on purpose instead of wading through the deep with blinders on wondering why things aren’t working. Kind of a similar concept to mindfulness in therapy. When it comes down to it, you can’t be afraid of putting in the work, because if you don’t, what other option is there but to stay in the bad place you are in. If you are having suicidal ideations, it sounds like you need to make a decision to do something drastic to change and you want to live because you are here. We want you to live too. Good luck."

Some folks, whether through personality or their own deficit in social skills may see cold call conversations unfavorably but for those folks you just need to respect the vibe and back off.

Try it once or twice a month and other people will start to bring in food as well and you will have something to talk about. 
Also, if you can, listen to them when they talk about something they like (TV show, craft, sports team etc) and ask questions about it. People love talking about themselves and things they like.

soc_1358582,socialskills,reddit_comment,261,"Just to use this an example, you talk about your feelings and thoughts about this, and I shared mine as well.

I feel like this is the best approach because it allows us to bond over it.  


You're right that everyone is different so it's hard, but to be fair, it's an issue on them for reacting negatively I think. A lot of the responses I see here just seem to be negative assumptions and points being made and ignoring the positive aspect of things. Unless you are constantly trying to one up someone or just talking about yourself only, it seems like a poor assumption to react so harshly, and benefit of the doubt should always be given otherwise.  


Some people may not want help like your example, and yeah it is a struggle. I think what you are doing is 100% okay, and no matter what we do nothing helps. But don't change either, however it doesn't hurt to try to practice other ways approach your relatability.

Edit: although actually, if you're in a group and you're all laughing at something, maybe on tv or whatever, I guess it's natural to look at the person you are closest to to see if they are also laughing, or if there's someone in the group you are interested in, you might look at them to see what they find funny.

To be honest I'm too old to be bothered trying for too long with someone who isn't in the same place as me.  I've also had some really amazing friendships with people who talk just as much if not more than I do.  

My only advice on people talking about themselves is to look at how organic your questions are coming across.  Simply asking questions one after another is going to put most people a bit on the defensive.  Today we constantly hear about the negatives of sharing too much personal/identifiable information online so sometimes less is more. 

There's no right way of building a meaningful connection but as a starting point/suggestion, perhaps try finding a couple of cool articles on common interests and just talk about that stuff for a while?  Maybe at the end of that they'll as you if your a musician/scientist/bio-mechanical engineer because of your view on the subject."

If there is a power differential, trust me that's only in the other person's mind. Even then being direct will eliminate the need for translation of what is being communicated. If it's a threat, directly communicate that threat so there is no doubt. Why be deceptive? Why live in fear of being offensive especially if you do not intend it? 

I get that people are different. I personally like the diversity of our world's people. I dislike the deceptive, passive nature of our languages. I find it cowardly, untrustworthy and disgusting.

I understand that to some I may come off as arrogant but, at least you know exactly where I stand on the issue. Whether or not you are offended by what I have said is merely your choice."

It seems that in any grammar school class there was always the one kid that was mercilessly picked on, who never learned how to protect or believe in themself. I was that kid. To this day I can’t remember anyone’s name that I don’t sit right next to and work with all day long. Know why? Well, when I was a young boy being introduced to someone for the first time I was so scared, so focused on smiling the right way, looking the right way, wondering if they were laughing at me on the inside already or how long it was going to take before they started being mean to me like the other kids- that I literally didn’t pay attention to their name or whatever they were saying to me. I was so focused on giving “the right answer” to whatever they said that WHO THEY WERE became irrelevant. That’s why today there are people I’ve worked with in a large office of over 80 people for over TEN YEARS who’s names I still do not know. They walk by me each day and say hi. They know my name but I don’t know their’s. Sad. But I understand, believe me."
soc_1463329,socialskills,reddit_comment,199,"That's the hardest part of all in my opinion. What happens when you inevitably collide with a challenge that is too great? How do you get back up? Should you even get back up? Why keep fighting? What's the point?

It really depends on you. You will be unlikely to find a purpose that will matter to you from someone outside of you. Others can influence you or give you guidance, but the final descision on what to pursue is made by you. You are likely the person who knows yourself best and what really fires you up. You need to find a reason why you continue to get up and keep moving forward. 

This might not happen right away, it may take weeks, months or even years. I understand this may be discouraging. I bet when you do find that reason, you will feel more alive than you ever felt before. Until then try to be kinder to yourself even if you don't feel like you deserve it.

In the mean time forgive yourself for not being able to overcome the trials you encounter. Either try again with tempered expectations or try something else. Take small managable steps."
soc_195904,socialskills,reddit_comment,220,"Ive been in a similar situation, but with a group of them. Personally i think its better to be alone than to hang out with someone that you have a toxic relationship with. Because you'll end up super unhappy since he will be mean to you rip you off, Put you down, Etc, And friends dont do that. You may also become just like him, like the old saying goes ""you are who your friends are"".  Just think about what you typed in your post ""Dave draws pleasure from making others suffer."" Do you really want to be around someone like that? I know It hard making friends  while being socially awkward but you eventually will find people you just mentally click with and you wont feel awkward at all. Okay maybe at first you will but building good friendships takes time. And it is well worth it you just got to tough out the awkwardness. Also none of my friends are douche bags. And this can be a issue because when your only close friend is a terrible person it warps your perception of what a real friend. Thats just my two cents.

I feel as though this is coming from a place of spite and not looking at the grand picture. All mental health is important. Just because someone is able to afford therapy in a country without universal health care doesn’t make their issues less important than someone who can’t afford it. 

Both of the scenarios you put out are important, it’s unfortunate that the later is a common issue but that doesn’t mean the first issue is any less valid than second."

soc_37717,socialskills,reddit_comment,437,"More than happy to give any questions a go!

To me, it all depends on how much you actually remember.

If you don't remember anything about the person - as if you might as well never have met them - then there isn't anything you can do. You will only notice when it is too late, so don't worry about it. The reason it happened might be because caught you at a bad time (like you groggy period) or it has been too long since they were relevant. If they caught you during your groggy period, you have a good excuse. If they didn't, well, apologize and ask them what they've been up to. Get to know them over again.

Lets say you have a hunch that you've met them before, but you can't remember anything. No name, no details, no idea of when or where, but you just have a feeling that you've seen them before. You could say something like

&gt; Hi! I am sure i've seen you somewhere before, but i just can't put my finger on it. 

From there it's up to you to choose how to approach it. Do whatever feels more comfortable. I usually take a pretty open approach and go ""Could you freshen up my mind a bit?"" or something like that. Leaves them open to talk about whatever.

The final is if you have forgotten their name. This is a bit trickier if you've known them for a long time, but there are a couple of ways you can do it. Firstly, if you haven't known each other for very long (but you remember something about them - like where you met), you can take the same sort of approach.

&gt; Hey, nice to see you again! I'm sorry, but i've forgotten your name, what is it again?

On the other hand, if you've known each other for a long time and you for some reason just can't remember, there is still a way, but you'll have to trick them a little. You basically find a way to tell them to send you a text with their name in it, so you can add them as a contact in your phone. This trick is situational, so i can't really give you any useful instructions there.

The important thing, if you actually want to tell them that you've forgotten them, is that you're sorry you did so. Be apologetic and show them that you are genuinely interested in getting to know them better, but it just slipped you mind.

I apologize for any grammatical mistakes. English is my second language."
soc_680379,socialskills,reddit_comment,165,"I feel the same. Recently graduated but didn't make any friends. Though I know many people but all of the are acquaintances. With some it was better than with others, but still no close friend. But i think the problem is inside us. Somehow it's hard to be friends with us. I'm thinking that it has something to do with trust. Because when you're making friends it means you're letting people close to you and to do that, you need to trust them. Majority of people don't have this issue, but for some of us it's really hard to make deep connection with people because of trust issues, not letting others close to us. But at the same time we're great at conversations, we're good listeners but we don't tell our own stories, we keep it to ourselves. Just my two cents to which I came after months of introspection.

soc_1555587,socialskills,reddit_comment,317,"Oh. Well you'll grow out of that fairly quick. Time flies and children grow to be adults. Some may think you become an adult when you turn a certain age to be ""allowed"" to do things, but if you wait to turn that age, you will learn instead that you become an adult when you decide to take on the challenges and responsibilities of being an adult, and that can happen at 12, 18, 30, or never at all.  

The fact that you posted this shows that on some level, you're curious about taking on some of that challenge.

To a woman, being authentic with your inner thoughts and feelings and putting them out there without shame or need for validation, now THAT is more attractive than any gift you can give her.

Being able to lay your truth in front of her, saying ""Hey, you seem interesting. I'd like to get to know you more. I'm thinking of eating ice cream in the park and I'd love for you to join me."" and then doing exactly that while getting to know her and enjoying good company. Or if she rejects you, you take that plan and go eat ice cream with your bros instead. This follow-up on a rejection is very important.

This is contrasted with something like ""um um I like you and I hope you like me back... do you like necklaces? Can I buy you a necklace? If you get a necklace from me will you love me?""

Notice how the energy is completely different. One is from a man and one is from a little boy. Girls love Men.

But if you ever do want to talk more, feel free to PM me as this thread's getting unwieldy :-)  I apologize in advance that it sometimes can take me days to respond.

And thank you for your kind offer!  The thing I need most right now is some way to get the birds outside to stop squawking piercingly exactly when I'm trying to sleep. I fear no method exists, but if you know any way, let me know!

My personal feelings on guns is no.  It's your decision, of course.  I just want to point out that the gun is often more of a danger to the owner and innocent bystanders than to any burglar or threatening person.  It is only safer if you 1) practice gun safety religiously, 2) spend a lot of time and money on the shooting range keeping your marksmanship skill high, and 3) are actively prepared to kill another person in the event you have to.  For that last, most people, even soldiers, are not actually prepared even if they think they are and therefore spoil their own aim at the last instant.  There have been studies.  Even with modern-day army training designed to overcome this natural human reluctance, a good percentage can't be trained out of it.

And this isn't just about killing.  Violence itself is not as common as media would have you believe.  Sure, there are lots of songs glorifying violence, also movies and videogames and etc.  But what that is is posturing.  Even animals in the wild prefer to posture when they can rather than engage in violence.  Do you have pets?  You can see that they growl/hiss at each other far more than they ever fight, and even in a fight it tends to be a swipe of a paw and then run away instead of a full-on brawl.  That's because getting in a fight means the risk of getting seriously hurt.  *Any* fight - look up, there are videos for example of rabbits, seemingly ultimate prey, chasing snakes up trees and beating up dogs.

Getting back to humans - this is why I said from the beginning that the actions of the guys you were living with seemed more like posturing, designed to intimidate you at most (and perhaps just to impress you with how tough they are).  These details you've added here confirm that idea.  I mean, they waved *pictures* of their guns around, rather than waving actual guns.  They invited you for that beer in the first place, and in my experience, guys don't do that unless they're feeling friendly.  Sure, you were nervous and shaking, but they would be interpreting that on the social level - ""guy won't relax despite the beer, do we really want to hang out with him again? Nah"" - than the threat level of ""must be hiding something, must be a rat."" Remember that none of your actions have been any threat to them, and the unkind words as just confirming that they managed to intimidate you (if they heard those words in the first place, which again, $100 for a bug is not pocket change).

But let's say they did hear, and are hopped up enough on ideals of violence and their own insecure masculinity to hold a grudge against you.  People like that, *would not be waging covert psychological warfare against you,* whispering threats in the hallway which they couldn't be sure of you overhearing (what if you had your headphones in? A good threat all wasted!)  No, wrong style altogether.  They would psych each other up as a group that something must be done about you (the fact that they're a group and you're alone would embolden them).  They would go in their group up to your door, and punch you, telling you to your face to stop talking to anybody 'or else.'  They would want to leave you in no doubt that it'd be better to keep your mouth shut.  In short, you wouldn't be wondering if they had a grudge, you would know while nursing some bruises right now."

I’m going to say some things that you can ignore if you want, or chew on, or whatever. If you want to shout at me, that’s OK too.

I feel for you, man. I hope you manage to work through this. It won’t be permanent. 

First, you’re not ugly. I know you don’t believe me, but just put that to the side for now. You don’t have to deal with that.

Second, yes, I see that you have a negative outlook. I don’t know your life or what you’ve been through so far to put you in that mindset, and I’m not invalidating it, but you can overcome that. It’s not going to be easy...in fact it will be super difficult, but you can do it. 

Third, even if you’re a complete asshole who argues with everyone and smells bad and has a vestigial purple tail covered in pubes, there will be someone who can deal with all of that and like you. It will be difficult to find those people, but they are out there.

Fourth, therapists are humans with all the inherent flaws, but they’re doing a job just like a house painter or a car mechanic. There are thousands of them. If you don’t like yours, see if you can get a different one. 

That’s it for my “uplifting” comments, so I’ll answer your questions:
Everyone matters at some point. I very much don’t matter to most people, but there are a few people’s lives I’ve impacted for better or worse over the years. Plenty of things I would love to erase, but I can’t, so I have to live with that. Thee are people I think would have something positive to say about my existence, but wouldn’t if I hadn’t been around as long as I have.
That said, I think it’s OK for people to give up. I don’t want to, but I’m not going to impose my personal choice on anyone. If living is intolerable, I think people should be able to quit. But, I would say you should give life a really deep investigation before you pull the plug. You can quit life anytime, that’s easy to do, but you can’t revoke that decision once you make it, so be absolutely sure there’s not something in it for you.

I’m not a therapist or anything, but I’ll talk with you if you want. I can’t check DMs because I use this shitty app, but you can reply to this thread if you want to engage. I’m a bit slow, but I do respond eventually."

Many guys see the gym as out of bounds for approaching girls, it's really up to you to ""accidentally"" bump into him outside and see if he fancies a post-workout coffee. Guys are paranoid that we come off creepy when there's a girl we are attracted to and can't keep our eyes off. 

I've known a couple of people without filters and they haven't changed. They're oblivious to the social cues which would tell them to STFU. One in a professional context I have simply had to avoid, she's too much of a liability to my career. She's happy, friendly and had no problem going on and on about how I sounded hungover after work drinks in a meeting when I was seeing some senior managers for the first time. She's not going to change, so i can't afford to be around her.

You should have a word with your housemate about slamming doors. That kind of behaviour is much easier to modify than not being able to pick up on social cues. 

As for the rest, she sounds human. We all get crabby and snarky at times. If I haven't had much sleep, followed by a rough day, I'll tell people that I'm not good company right now because I know that I get irritable and actively trying to not be irritable, well, it makes me irritable. If she needs some space, then give it to her - unless she's monopolising a communal area.

Some people are best at a distance. Someone can be and absolute riot, but you wouldn't want to have that 24/7. That might be why your friends like her better, it's in small doses for them and you can forgive eccentricity when you don't have to live with it.

In short, I think you might be able to modify her actions like slamming doors, but not her filterless personality. You'll either have to find peace with it or get distance."
soc_534209,socialskills,reddit_comment,689,"Being a father is a very thankless job, I think some fathers get hung up on that. The kids always run to mom for everything and see dad as just the ""house provider"". It doesn't excuse his behavior but it might explain it. I feel like I would have a tough time being a parent as well. Even planning events to go to with friends, they never offer to pay for things like gas, parking, etc..I feel like I have to babysit them the whole time, and they always complain about everything that's ""wrong"", like having to walk a little far or having to carry something, instead of showing appreciation for being somewhere cool and doing something fun. I feel like having kids is really hard because they just don't tend to show any real appreciation for what you do for them , but at the same time they don't really know any better.

When I was your age, I was very angry at my dad as well. He was always getting pissed off and fighting with my mom. We have exchanged some really hurtful words between each other and there were times when I couldn't stand to even look at him. Yeah, I said I hated him out of anger before. Your post sounds similar to how I used to feel. But I didn't really mean it. When I look back on it, I am thankful for everything he did and still does for me. He provided me with a roof over my head and helped me out financially. He didn't come from much money but he built himself up and worked extremely hard so he could buy a house and raise a family, and give his kids a good life. But I always took it for granted, because it was just 'my life' that I was born into, and I didn't really know any differently. I was never really able to conceptualize the amount of time and hard work it took to be provided with the life that I have.

Parents aren't perfect. They're just people. Sometimes your parents are going to fight with each other, sometimes they're going to have rough patches and hate each other for a while. Sometimes they're going to get pissed off at their kids and yell at them. It doesn't mean they don't love you. My dad was always trying to ""toughen me up"" by arguing with me and picking on me. I feel like he had good intentions but he just didn't know how to do some things properly. Just try not to take sides...there could be a very legitimate reason why your dad might be angry that you just don't know about. Let your mom and dad sort their issues out on their own and try not to get involved.

My dad still gets mad sometimes, and he still annoys me sometimes. But now that I'm a little older, I can understand it better. I have a much better relationship with him now compared to when I was a teenager. When you're a teen, your parents are just really annoying, and you might be really annoying to your parents..no offense, that's just the way it is with many families. My advice when he's mad at you, is just try to reason with him and don't resort to getting angry and fighting with him. Try to understand more of where he's coming from, and appreciate the good things that he does and don't focus on the bad. He probably just wants to feel loved by his family, and maybe he feels like he's not quite getting that. I'm sure he has some good qualities as well...just try to show more appreciation for those good qualities and I'm sure you'll start getting some of it back.

Also, you might regret it someday talking about how much you hate him. Just try to be careful with your choice of words because they really do have lasting effects on people. Don't talk about wanting to threaten your dad with a knife..that kind of behavior and thinking is only contributing to a dysfunctional household."

soc_234713,socialskills,reddit_comment,302,"Honestly, I think if you're a co-worker and you generally do your job decently and you're not an asshole (super aggressive or inconsiderate), you'll get along with people for the most part.  You don't have to be super social.  If I'm kind of slacking off or I'm a bit moody one day, it's not too big of a deal as long as it's not a routine.

When you're at a new job, you don't have to immediately open up to everybody.  Be pleasant, smile, do your job, and your co-workers will slowly open up to you.  Unless your boss is an asshole or you really fucked up, you probably wont get yelled at.  If you do get reprimanded or criticized though, 9 times out of 10, it's best to just apologize, take responsibility, avoid excuses, and say it won't happen again.  Having a difficult co-worker though can be a tough situation but that varies from case to case.  

Most office environments aren't like high school (thank god).  People have more important things to do with their time and they have their own job responsibilities, families, kids, social lives, and mortgages, etc. to worry about to be gossiping about your quirks.

It's always nervewrecking to have a new job but I'd worry about the things you can control first, namely your new job performance.  Even though the new position sounds more competitive and younger, I think you'll find your co-workers will probably be similar to your old job once you get settled in.

If you do want to get closer to your co-workers, ask the older people about their kids.  Maybe go with your younger co-workers to happy hour sometime, which is always fun.  Ask about plans for the weekends, vacations, sports, weather, work even, etc. and eventually you'll find some common ground.

I first started to get past some of my shyness by switching my way of thinking of it as *specific things* I had to do or say, and instead trying to find the root of the problem and different ways I could change that. 

I was kind of like you, just found it hard to make conversation or to contribute. I had to ask myself why, and it was just the pressure of trying to make conversation made me build that up so much it was almost impossible and I found myself second guessing myself all the time before sharing or adding anything to a convo. 

The first major changes for me came when I started reading about body language, it was a huge self awareness boost for me because it made me notice how my thoughts were affecting me physically and vice versa. Rather than starting with my thoughts, I noticed when I'd be doing awkward things with my body which would tell me I was feeling anxious or distracted and this was a huge help because thoughts are so hard to pinpoint or recognize when you are trying to change something in your life, but your body language tells everything and you can notice it right away, then you can address your thoughts and get into a better pattern. Even just adjusting your body language from looking uncomfortable will make people enjoy having you around more, even if you aren't saying much, I noticed this almost instantly. When your body language shows you aren't into the convo, everyone feels uncomfortable.

Here is a good youtube video on that: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zpf8H\_Dd40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zpf8H_Dd40)  


Secondly, to start contributing more I started listening to a ton of talk radio and podcasts rather than music. For me, I had a challenge with speaking and articulating the things I was thinking in a way that felt natural to me. I had to find my voice, and I found listening to other people talk a lot and just having organic conversations helped me find what I liked and how I wanted to talk to other people. I would hear someone ask a question or make a response and I was like like ""wow I love how they said that"" or ""what a GOOD question"", and those are really the building blocks of conversations. Once you learn how to articulate your thoughts confidently by finding your voice it becomes way easier. 

My last thought is kind of just on track with what some others are saying, take the pressure off yourself a bit. Remember that **not everything you say has to be amazing or profound or funny**, sometimes people don't even need or want you like that, sometimes they need someone to listen, or validate, or challenge, or reassure them. People tell you things for a million reasons and you don't always have to respond in some sort of unique and special way, at their core they just want to feel respected, appreciated, or understood. "

However not everyone are like that. The people who have self awareness and aren't self entitled assholes usually gets the signal when you show it to them that you aren't interested in talking and for the people who go strike their conversation first time are probably really nervous and will make it seem awkward but the second or third time it's probably more smooth. 

Don't be angry at the social interraction but rather on peoples ignorance of each others privacy.

soc_434204,socialskills,reddit_comment,203,"It's a tough thing to work on.  You have to find a way to stop chasing girls.  Force yourself to do it at first, then eventually as you figure some other stuff out, it will become natural.  The odd consequence is that once you legitimately stop caring about chasing girls (and aren't just faking it like at first), they'll be more likely to come to you.  


Figure out what you're in to.  What are your hobbies?  What are you good at?  If you think hard enough and don't give up, you can probably come up with a list of things you like about yourself.  Focus on improving those or setting new goals for yourself that have nothing to do with getting approval from others, things that just make YOU feel good for achieving whether anyone else ever knows you did it or not.  Try to force yourself to keep your goals and personal work to yourself for a while, that way you know if you're still getting enjoyment, they're truly being done for you and not for the approval of others.    


I can't tell you what to do specifically because different things work for different people, but it will go a long way.  "
soc_1568606,socialskills,reddit_comment,941,"You clearly were offended by my post. Otherwise you wouldn't respond with an entire essay trying to prove your supposed superiority. Maybe you're insecure about something and that's why you're lashing out at me for a harmless response.

&gt;That’s your personal choice, I have no interest in people who obsessed with “trying to be youthful” but also age doesn’t have anything to do with that. Unless your just talking about living pay check to pay check, partying and living like you’d be ok dying. Then I really don’t know what makes dating people who are your equals in total time life experiences has to do with whatever a mature lifestyle is.

I'm not ""obsessed with trying to be youthful"". Last time I checked 28 was still young. Anyway, never said anything about ""living from paycheck to paycheck"". As far as partying goes, what's wrong with that? There isn't an age limit to that.

&gt;Most men I’ve lived around date really young girls because the girls are naive in that they don’t have their level of relationship experience and ability to see these guys red flags. Doesn’t mean that’s universally true, just what I’ve seen with my own eyes.

Yeahhhh, I don't think your anecdotal experience is enough evidence. Besides, I think you need to be more specific with the age difference between these men and these ""really young girls"". If you're talking 40 year olds dating 18 year olds, that's one thing (even then I think it's well within the right of consenting adults to do what they want).

But if it's say, a 28 year old dating a 23 year old, they're practically the same age. As a 28 year old I would not go as low as 18 for relationships. My range would probably be from about early 20s-early 30s. Is this acceptable to someone like you (I really don't care whether it is or not, but go ahead and humor me).

&gt;I’d call my life mature. I own houses, I have investments, I’m at a professional level for employment, I’m a parent, and I take care of myself.

Good for you. Though I do find it funny how you use being a parent and home ownership as a measurement of maturity. Not everyone wants to have kids or even get married, and not everyone is able to purchase a home by a certain age, especially in 2022.

Really the only requirement for an adult is to make a living and pay the bills. Everything else, such as like having kids, owning a home, and being at ""professional level"" for employment is all arbitrary.

&gt;I also routinely go to raves, concerts, festivals, trips, and my most recent fun was hopping out to Hawaii last weekend to go learn to surf and go to a rave because electric daisy carnival isn’t my scene, if there’s no nature or a lot of concrete it’s not really a festival I’m into. Prefer a bit of a natural vibe with the feeing of nature being alive instead of a 100% man made area.  
My next big trip is to go to tomorrow land in Belgium in July. With my “mature lifestyle” I can do the things I want in life, and any one I date needs to be close to my level of responsibility. Mature people don’t OD on drugs that aren’t laced because if you are mature you know your limits and are mature enough to indulge sparingly instead of chasing dragons.

Again, good for you. Though I assume when you are not on those trips, you're pretty much living to work. IDK how demanding your job is, but usually people higher in the corporate ladder have less free time and more responsibility. I'm not talking ""routinely taking trips"", I'm talking about having a work-life balance. 

Personally I value a good work-life balance, and if that means going on trips less often, so be it. Granted if you enjoy your work that's different. I just have no desire to work up the corporate ladder. 

Also I never mentioned ""OD-ing on drugs"" or anything like that. I'm not a fan of drugs, heck I don't even really drink. But continue to put words in my text.

&gt;If you are mature you can plan your future and save you finances, you can make commitments and. Follow through. Kids not so much lol, there are outliers but it’s not worth hunting them and frankly I find younger people sexually unattractive as well, so there’s a lot im not into.  
The only kids that can do what I do are spoiled, or racking up massive amounts of debt. Which is not mature. Mommy and daddy giving you money, or borrowing from your future for a fleeting good time is way immature.

Depends on what you consider ""kids"" and ""younger"". As far as planning your future goes, not everyone maps out their life like that. Sure I make short term plans, but I'm not one of those ""5 year and 10 year plans"" type of guys. 

I'd rather work to make a decent living, and then enjoy my free time doing the things I actually enjoy doing. I have no interest in climbing the corporate ladder. I've discovered somewhat recently that I'm not career-oriented. And that's perfectly fine. 

Oh and also, if we're going to talk maturity here, part of that is accepting that not everyone sees things the same way you do. Also, a mature person wouldn't write a whole wall of text trying to prove why he or she is so much better. Especially in response to a small comment that was a harmless opinion."
soc_1800371,socialskills,reddit_comment,355,"&gt;Anyways thanks I shall see what I can do.

Oh boy, you think 18-19 is not young. Damn. I am 28. Then what i am ? A grandma ?  I always complain about my age but i never let a friend or colleague to call me big sis kinda stuff. So 18-19 is still really young. You can consider yourself young til 25 probably. At least thats what my cell phone company counted me as young. But then you re being full grown up and like next stage of your life is getting old. Yuck. 

Anyway since you re too young there will be lots of opportunities in your life. Of course its up to you a bit. If you close yourself in your room for years you ll miss a lot. Try and fail, that why you can improve. That way one day you can be more confortable and might have a good friends. I like your mentality. I think you can make it.  

And dont forget, you should never give up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Note : My experience with therapist was not good but if you have a change, you should try it. Maybe yours wont be bad and it will work well.

Note 2 : Really. Check self help books. Depression (generally books related depression explains whats wrong with your thoughts and you ll see that your anxiety can cause depression, so probably you ll spot lots of sign of depression on yourself (maybe it was in the past) ) and any kind of anxiety will book teach something to you to help with your anxiety. As long as you understand and embrace the what you read, with time it will make a difference. I used to have a bad voice in my head telling bad things to me, but today i dont have it. I do believe that self help books help me to get rid of it :) 

Note 3: Writing really helps you to clear your head. As an example if i m angry i will write down and i m not that angry anymore.And i can concentrate on other things."
soc_897960,socialskills,reddit_comment,185,"Maybe she is more of a texter than a caller. I can relate because I'm somewhat in a similar situation/ friendship dynamic. I can't speak for your friend per se but I might be able to provide a possible reason based on my experience. I find it difficult to initiate phone calls because I fear that I will be a disturbance to the party on the other end. I will definitely and willingly answer the calls, as long as I'm free though. During the phone calls, I truly enjoy the conversations and phone calls we have. 

As someone who finds it really close to impossible initiating a phone call, it is something I'm always apologetic about to my friend. However, him understanding me and accepting me has made me ever so grateful and appreciative of him and this friendship we both have and it's something I'll never take for granted. 

Don't read too much into it and if you're really curious, casually bring it up during one of your conversations and she might open up to you regarding it. All the best for your friendship!"
soc_77091,socialskills,reddit_comment,417,"""But I care enough to let her hear me out, that's why I argue back""

You're an asshole.  If you honestly believe that you are giving the gift of enlightement to another person and only doing so out of you're own generousity, you're an asshole (or at least coming off as one).

If you're an adult, you have other options other than arguing back.  The most important first step is to tell her that you hear what she's saying.  From there, you can point out that this conversation is just going to be a bunch of pointless bickering that won't lead anywhere, so why not put aside the differences and just enjoy your time together as a family?  You don't necessisarily have to state all of this word for word, but if you know that you're going to have an argument and you're not going to ""win"", what's the point?

Being an adult means that you can look outside yourself and realize that other people have shit they have to deal with just like you.  It's not the same issues, but still.  Do you think that your mother enjoys arguing with you?  If so, that sounds like a much larger issue that would be worth considering directly addressing her in a 1 on 1 relaxed environment.  If not, then both of you don't like it so why are you continuing to engage in it?  You were the one who claimed to be an adult.  Suck it up and be a bigger person and both of you will be the better for it.  Yeah, it sucks knowing that you have a great strategy to approaching an argument and not being able to use it, but consider what your relationship with your mother is worth.

I know it's hard to imagine, but in a few decades your mother's going to be dead.  I know this is a bit blunt, but bear with me.  Do you want to look back on your time with her and think that you spent all your time arguing or do you want to look back and see that relationship as a beautiful thing?  Again, imagery, but when your mom gets up there in ages, do you really want her memories of you to be arguement after arguement?  Do you think that's really the person that she wanted you to be?

Suck it up.  We have a limited amount of time on this earth.  Think about what really matters to you and make your choice."
soc_1189337,socialskills,reddit_comment,206,"Everyone is different bruh. Maybe she didn't like the question. Maybe she didn't like the question coming from the new person. Maybe she was busy. Maybe she had other things on her mind and didn't want to make small talk about her dog at that time. 

What if you thought the question was nice but for whatever reason she thought it wasn't nice? I mean who knows, that could be the case. And if it were the case you ought to respect that, and if you don't respect it then you aren't being nice anyway. Asking what you consider to be a nice question and then expecting a nice reply could definitely be considered a rude and entitled attitude. And I mean it sounds like you're now doubling down on that by ignoring her now. 

So yeah my advice would be to be nice. But by nice I mean be open minded and flexible. Try not to get twisted up over small slights. How you feel is largely on you, and how you react is absolutely 100% on you. People aren't like vending machines where you put in a nice question and get out a nice response or something.

Rarely will anyone ever say to your face ""I dont want to he your friendh"" to your face.  But what you CAN do is work on ""reading between the lines"".

As with the social awkwardness, you worrying too much what people think of you which is the foundation of your awkwardness.

soc_1475858,socialskills,reddit_comment,236,"Sorry, I thought it might cheer you up. Okay, here goes:

I didn’t do much partying in my senior year, either. I found my crowd in college and we still didn’t do any wild partying, we just hung out and had a good time and everyone was accepting and accepted.

Have you heard of self-fulfilling prophecies? Well, if you believe you‘re “gonna live a boring life and be depressed most of the time”, it’s most certainly going to happen. However, if you imagine something different for your future, that’s just as likely to come true, because you will make steps in that direction.

Right now you believe what other people have said about you, that you are wasting your senior year, that you have to party etc. I suggest that you look into your heart and find out who you really are and who, and how, you want to be - apart from the standard “I want to be like the others and fit in”.

You can’t be “like the others” because everyone is different, we are individuals. But you can be yourself, and by being yourself you will become happier.

Example: maybe you don’t like big loud parties but you enjoy cooking for a handful of select friends and having a quiet dinner party where everyone feels welcome and safe enough to talk. Try new things, find out what you like and go with that."
soc_261881,socialskills,reddit_comment,288,"Yeah, I agree! 

I have no problems saying hello to her (I'll do this if I see her around, or at least respond to her very enthusiastic hello) but we only ever see each other in momentary passing so it just feels off kilter to stop a stranger in passing just to ask them how their week has been (when they clearly need to return to their department). 

I also usually only see her once a month. (Last summer I was seeing her around all the time, but she's since return to uni). So the social momentum is being derailed by long leaps of absence. When I do finally see her again, it's in passing, and I feel like she wants me to talk to her, but I also don't want to take up her time when she's actually being paid to work. 

Last Thursday I entered the store and she was stacking customer baskets right at the entrance I entered from. She looked up to see who it was, and when she noticed me she looked down again...

*''Okay... ''* I thought. She must not want to say hi so I decided I'd just slip by her, but then she quickly looks back up when she realises I'm not going to say anything and says hello to me with the biggest smile. 

When she's meant to be returning to her register and I'm meant to be starting my shift in my own department, it just doesn't seem like a fitting time to start a conversation about the weather. And since this subtle game of back and forth has been going on for over 6 months, it feels like it's reached a point where introductions are now unnecessary. "
soc_55014,socialskills,reddit_comment,299,"The kind of person I'm talking about isn't that common.  I've only met a handful in my life.  If you're getting the same treatment from a bunch of different people, I think they're lording it over you just because they can.  I still think they're insecure, because it isn't an attractive way to behave, and they wouldn't expose themselves that way unless they were getting badly needed satisfaction out of it.  I bet you are getting picked on by people who are just barely above you in the social pecking order, people who don't get many opportunities to be dominant.  That would explain why their methods are so clumsy and aggressive.  Someone accustomed to social respect would behave more graciously towards you.

&gt; I guess I would like to find a way of making them know that I'm not interested by what they're saying without setting the stage for a confrontation.

They're hostile to you.  They don't care if you're interested in what they're saying.  Making you listen anyway is part of the power game.

How you should deal with it depends on your particular situation.  Social jockeying at work can be deeply important when management is involved, but among the lower ranks, it often means nothing.  (The most skilled and cruel bullies are often the employees perpetually stuck in low positions, watching more talented people get promoted past them year after year.)  If the social jockeying you're involved in has no power implications, then it should be meaningless to you, which will liberate you to ignore people or strike back at them with no fear of the consequences.  If the social jockeying is meaningful, then you should be more careful.  Stand up to them in small ways, nurture your confidence, employ humor and mockery, and look for allies.

soc_901925,socialskills,reddit_comment,221,"People make quick assumptions that they then just rely on because it's easier. And  it's more difficult to change an impression than to make a good impression to begin with. However, I DO think overall impressions can be changed. Believe it or not the problem resides at least as much with you as it does with them. This is how it goes: They ""know"" you're anti-social, so they (pretty much unconsciously) give you a disinterested or standoffish vibe. You can't help but pick up on THAT, and be affected by it, which further pushes you into a defensive anti-social mode. Thus reinforcing their original feelings. The only way to change that is by changing YOUR mindset as to who you are, and what you bring to any interaction. You have to completely shift your natural perspective of reacting to those around you to INITIATING with those around you and BRINGING THE VIBE to the interaction. In other words it doesn't depend on them and whatever reaction or impression they had. It depends on you and your confident presentation of yourself as giving off a Fun Vibe. But you can see it requires quite a bit of inner work on yourself to GET your mindset into one of confidence and bringing a fun vibe. But that's what has to happen. Good luck!"

If you are close with your family and feel supported and seen by them, then maybe you don't need to seek out other relationships elsewhere. Not everyone has that sort of relationship with their family, though. Coworkers, that really depends heavily on where you work and who you work with (I can think of some industries where coworkers have extremely strong solidarity with each other, but certainly none that I have worked in).  

Again, it's about balance. If life doesn't hand you a good family or a good community or a good working situation, you have to seek it out yourself to get your emotional needs met, and friendships are the most low-barrier way to do that."

Few people actually ""check in"" on the people they've screwed over since their own lives are a happy go lucky fuck others over and keep winning fest. And they're traveling witb ""eat, pray, and loving"" kind of life. ""Living well is the best revenge"" is just giving sociopaths free tickets to fuck people.

I won't confirm if I've done this but...hat, sunglasses, plus a guest entry at a library or college computer. Use USB to copy and paste a prewritten word document because you might only have 10 mins of guest usage.

Post to craigslist about Superbowl tickets and a friend who bailed and now you're looking to recoup costs at a huge loss just to get something back. Put your ex's phone number down...a number that will explode. A number that they will have to delete and go through the process of telling their friends and coworkers they had to get a new number.


And the little digging they do, will show they will know that SOMEONE probably did it to them...someone anonymous, no sure thing, and it's likely payback for something shitty they did, they just might reflect on being less shitty since there is literally nothing but shadows to punch.

Cops won't find it worth investigating, no strong enough ""crime"" to chase, if it can even be called that, and even if they muster the man power to track the IP, they'll see a grainy footage of hat and sunglasses person.

Telling me *now* that you'll be my friend after it is too late - fter the bran door is closed - is simply mockery.

I suggest to you, please stop browsing this subreddit. I found in my experience that it actually reinforced my negative mindset and held me back from making good progress. Pick up the books and learn how to become the person you long to be. If you want to do therapy, its up to you, but i personally did not find it necessary. The only problem you currently have is your mindset. You need to retrain your brain.

Google Cognitive behavioral therapy. Find a book that can help you self administer it and do it. I personally used CBT for dummies and it worked wonderfully.

Google books on overcoming social anxiety. Find a book that can help fix your distorted thought patterns and personal beliefs. I dont have a partivular recommendation for this book, you’ll have to search for one yourself.

Google books on improving your social skills.  I personally love the social skills guidebook by Chris Macleod.

I used to think i would never get a girlfriend. Then when i turned 25, i did. Dater her for a year and a half and broke up, however I’m still super close to her and now we are set to be lifelong friends.

Please, dont waste anymore of your prime years of your life living in a way that is not  satisfying or fulfilling for you. It is my biggest regret in my life, and i dont want you or others to make the same mistakes that i made. 

Read books, listen to audiobooks, whatever is more conforable to you. Learn and retain the knowledge and wisdom you need to improve yourself, so that you can do what YOU want.

Experience told me that we tend to put our position in the worst situation. Let's say, you are in this depressive state, thinking that if you talk to them, you'll be ignored, rejected, hated. This might happen, you might be rejected, but what really matters here is how you think about yourself. What do you think you deserve from social interactions? You're not thinking: ''I deserve to have friends and have fun in my interactions with others''. Your tendency is more like: ''my presence will be unnoticed, I'll feel embarrassed because the others will say...''. Your focus is on the others, not yourself. And there is a huge change here to make that won't come from your mind, but a blind faith in yourself.

I've been there too, and it's all so simple that's even stupid how we complicate things. How many times have you been thinking ''they don't text me, they hate me, they ignore me, I'll be alone forever'', and you just keep waiting for them to text you to feel better about yourself and, suddenly, somebody texts you and ask how are you, or if you should go for a drink together. And then, ''magically'' and suddenly, those thoughts you had a second ago become so meaningless that you even forget about them in an instant. It is never about the other's thinking.

It is about a false self-value we extract from the external world. You send information outside (your behaviour) with the expectations to create a response in others' behaviours, and then you want this results (feedback from others about who you are) to return to you, and you'll wrongly use this to fill the container of your self-worth. This way, you become a slave of what others think of you, to make you who you are. Rather, try to give yourself the permision to feel embarrased, to have fears, because those feelings are yours and so they talk about you. Look at them and, still, keep moving. You are afraid of being rejected, well, then go to that social meeting and invite your fear to accompany you and see how, despite those feelings, you are still there. Fear will think: ''Fuck, I don't control this guy anymore, he's too brave. Better chill in my hammock made of shadows while I let this guy live his life freely.'' Jus remember, your thoughts are not true. And if you are to get rejected, there's only one way to know anyways. And it's not by your thoughts.

Here's an advice that has worked to this 29yo socially shy guy. Never wait for the others to text you. Never. You text first, you make plans first. You take the lead of your social life. Eventually, these thoughts will come to your mind: ''but this plan I'm making is stupid, but these things I enjoy make me look like a fool, but I'm not that confident to organize this, nobody will have a drink with me, etc etc etc''. All of them are false. You gain confidence by stepping on the ground and saying: hey! I'm here and what I want is to enjoy a drink/meeting/game with my friends! I want that, and because of it I won't even ask for permission. I'll make it happen!

Another thing to add to diminish the energy of your negative thoughts is knowing that people who are used to socialize have 2 thoughts about those who don't join them:

1. They think you are busy and determined to do other things rather than going out with them. That's why they don't move a finger for you, because they think you don't need them right now. (This is very related to appearances. Because we don't want to look fragile, we show ourselves as OK and in control when we are not).

2. The most social/outgoing people believe there's no point in staying at home and might take it personally when you decide not to have a drink that day. But this doesn't mean you, as a person, are not worth it for them. Social isolation is one of the problems that are more misunderstood by others. Make sure you choose your people wisely.

That's it. Remember that whatever you think is not that heavy, and reduce its importance little by little, questioning those thoughts. For example: How many of those people know that you truly care for them? Why should I wait for them to text me, when I can create the plans first? Do I ask for help when I feel alone or I just trap myself in my desire of not being alone?

Wish you the best in your path. You are still young, remember the purpose in life is to enjoy, and the only way to have fun is for us to allow it to happen."
soc_1290438,socialskills,reddit_comment,362,"Hello! I was in a really similar position to you a few years ago. I lost several close friends as a result of me acting dumb during several years of drinking and they got tired of it it all decided to stop talking to me around the same time. I'm not gojng to lie, it was really hard but it gave me the push I needed to improve and life is much better now. 

1. I quit drinking - this was instrumental for several reasons. First, when you have an addiction and keep returning to it, you lose trust in yourself because you aren't following through on your decision. When you choose to quit something and actually follow through, it builds trust. For me, quitting drinking was the foundation for being able to improve in other ways because I proved to myself that I could stick with something. I would suggest you go to r/leaves and check out some books on how to quit weed to help you. This is the best decision you can make for yourself.

2. I deleted my social media. For this, I felt so hurt seeing my friends have good social lives online when I had lost them. Deleting my social media really helped with that! 

3. Accept that the friends are gone and build a life without them - this is easier without social media. I made new friends. I focused on the friends I still had. I tried to be a better friend to the people in my life moving forward. 

4. Read self help books about emotional intelligence, mindfulness, meditation. You need to see where you went wrong and give yourself the tools to fix it.

After 2 years of this I downloaded social media again as I had started to feel isolated and I actually reconnected with several of the friends who I had lost, who were happy to see me! Which felt amazing. But i don't think this would have happened without the period of work ajd self reflection I had.  I am much, much much happier with who I am as a person right now, and you can be as well."
soc_209380,socialskills,reddit_comment,593,"Let's get to the core problem: What is the worst thing that could happen to you? People are most likely going to laugh at you, judge you, and think you are the stupidest person in the world. Is this your worst critique in life? Are you going to die from people talking shit about you? What is the worst consequence of your actions? You are most likely going to cry? Be depressed? Get in an argument? Are you that weak to the point where you let people influence you? This is what your problem really is: You are letting people influence you. You are letting people dictate how you live your life, what you do every day, and what and how you feel your emotions. Are you in any way telling people how to live their life? No! This life is about you and your happiness, you will be happy with what you like and express, just like people are by expressing themselves. Don't be afraid of judgment, it will come and go your entire life. Judgment is there only for what, a few seconds? a few minutes? a few hours? Does that equal your whole fucking life span? Will it be with you the next hour, tomorrow, the next Monday, the weekend? Do you want to be like those crazy and homeless people on the streets talking to themselves, dressing and smelling very bad, eating street food, and ask for money at the train stations, shopping centers? Do you want to develop anxiety, and other psychological disorders? Do you not care about yourself? Let this life be a journey of your happiness and well-being. People will come and go, there are 318.9 million people in the US, only a selected few are your real friends and family. What does 99.9% people have to offer you? Nothing. Live your life in a way which makes you happy. 

You cannot grow as a person if you are not dealing with this core problem. Ask yourself this question again: what is really stopping me from being happy? Your answer will always be people's judgment. You and many of us here are made to have a thick skin. This is the ultimatum that all of us here need to reach. Our potentials are far greater than normal people living next to you and the neighborhood else where, hence, our problems. 

As far as conversing with people/girls go, it really depends on how you carry yourself, what your beliefs are, and what your goal really is, etc. Do you want to be friends with someone for money or friendship, do you want to talk to girls for a one night stand, or as a wife or girlfriend, or as a friend etc. things like that. Two things I would like to advise: Avoid small talk, and avoid fake interest in people. They can see through your bullshit very, very clearly. Be genuine, respectful, and humble. 

Finally, express how you feel. You want to talk to someone, go talk. You want to express your emotions through art forms or music, go draw or dance, or listen to music. The worse thing you can do to yourself is continue heightening the injury. Do you need help? Ask for help! Be yourself and be true to yourself. 

I can go on but let me just stop here. If you have any questions or need advice, please reply!

Please watch this, I hope you might learn something. These guys are my role models that I consider my best friends (digital): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oydsYxgHW0Y&amp;ab_channel=JustKiddingNews"
soc_842646,socialskills,reddit_comment,234,"You can't be yourself because ""yourself"" is itself in conflict. You can't be introverted and care about people's judgement of your opinions about you being introverted, or the rules of social dynamics...or...You can't be social and want to be introverted. 

This is what I'm trying to say. The ""yourself"" RIGHT NOW is someone who has conflicting traits. 

&amp;nbsp;

How do you fix that?

&amp;nbsp;

The thing is: learning to be and like being social will change the ""yourself"" that you are such that you CAN just be yourself, because the ""yourself"" you change into is a social person....or...learning to be ok with the judgement of introversion will allow you to be yourself because the ""yourself"" you change into either doesn't care,or has come to peace with that judgement. 

&amp;nbsp;

What's the common theme in these solutions?

&amp;nbsp;

Change. Specifically YOUR change. Most ppl keep being their same ""self"" and wishing the world would change and adapt for them. Which is frankly narcissistic. 

So you need to change then. The question you need to answer is: IF I could change and be ok with being introverted (you absolutely can)...would I do that? 

Or

IF I could change and become a social person who fits in with social dynamics of the world (you absolutely can)...would I do that? 

&amp;nbsp;

I can help you either way. But YOU need to decide the way. So which is it?"
soc_155982,socialskills,reddit_comment,155,"Understanding why you do something is absolutely essential to any sort of critical thinking or intellegent living. Even if it's ""I did this thing because I believe 'X'. Or because I value 'Y'."" 

For example,  I saved my money and didn't go out to the bar because I value security and I want to know that I will make rent or that I am preparing now for retirement or whatnot""

On the flipside,  I spent money and went out because I value social interaction and right now, living in the moment experiences.  

Neither scenario is right or wrong but yoy have to understand your personal values and priorities and how they play into your decisions. Conversely, you have to be open to the fact that other people will make different decisions than you because they have different values. But trying to understand another persons reasons and values is not manipulation,  its the foundation of tolerance. "
soc_218000,socialskills,reddit_comment,149,"Hey there!
I can't really tell you what would fit you well since I don't know what you look like. I understand what you are trying to go for. Actually, I would find that Saywer's haircut from lost would be really cool with a short beard: http://crushable.com/files/2010/05/sawyer_lost.jpg

Anyways, it's up to you to find a cool hairstyle. Now, I would suggest you sit down and think why you are afraid of the barber. You probably will find a reason. However, that reason will be completely irrational. There aren't any ways you can rationalize that thought. What I suggest is that you drink one beer or two and just go. Of course the effect of alcohol will change your social inhibitions, but the next time you need a haircut, you will ask yourself if everything went fine the last time. The answer to that will be yes.

Good luck OP!"
soc_572442,socialskills,reddit_comment,162,"Hi there. 
I think it's great that you are making the effort to improve yourself, but if there is one thing I've learnt, you will never be able to gauge the 'proper' distance with someone as it is different for everyone.

Instead, try focusing on others instead of worrying about making yourself more social. By listening to others in casual conversation, and being genuinely interested in what they are saying, they will open up to you more, and you in turn can perhaps start more conversations with them or invite them to places based on what their likes.

I understand it's going to be hard at first, especially if you are not used to taking the initiative in social situations. Additionally, there will be some ppl who are just too difficult to connect with socially. That being said, focus on others instead of worrying how you might be perceived by them; this is the most important step IMO in forming closer relationships."
soc_701893,socialskills,reddit_comment,202,"By reading some of your other comments, the first step is to learn to love yourself. And if you dont see that as possible, you need make yourself worthy of your own love. Every person is capable of change, and only you can truly judge you, because only you know your intentions. A person is not really the measure of only the things people see, but their intentions and actions. Learn to forgive yourself by knowing youve changed your intentions, and by practicing change today. There is no need to be the person you were yesterday ever. 

Love yourself, and practice empathy. A good practice in empathy is curiosity, you may not like the body that person has, but what kind of life were they able to live like that? Are they an interesting person underneath that? Are they a good person? Or whatever questions you may have, doesnt matter.

I highly recommend ego work as well, there are direct routes, but im wary to recommend them without knowing you better. I know people that have seen great success with meditation. 

Take a look at integral theory for ego work, and generally restructuring your life in a positive and evolved way:

soc_1448319,socialskills,reddit_comment,353,"A couple different potential things could be going on here, but I don't think either is a cause for hurt feelings.

1) She views you as a much younger co-worker and doesn't place much value on hanging out in places you hang out. (e.g. the pop-up event) In that situation even if ANYONE 'expressed an interest,' there's no obligation to go. It isn't like an explicit invitation to something you're hosting.

2) Perhaps she's aware that you'd like to get closer and just isn't all that interested. So she acts basically friendly (as a co-worker should) but doesn't follow up on things because she doesn't want to establish a 'friends' relationship. And tbh it IS a little unusual for someone in your age range to befriend someone that much older. 

So she isn't doing anything 'hurtful,' I think you're not properly interpreting the signals she's giving off, which is that she's not all that connected with what you're offering. While remaining basically polite and friendly.

My advice is to ditch the hurt feelings. Reach out as you feel so inclined -- another event, sure! More food -- why not! See if she goes for any of it. I'm not saying she's totally uninterested, she may just be forgetful, distracted, whatever. 

Think of her as someone who 'maybe has potential' so just keep reaching out when you feel like, but invest no emotional energy in the outcome. 

So reach out when you want to, and DON'T SWEAT IT if she doesn't respond. Don't expect her to. There's nothing wrong with continuing to reach out because you never know, right?

Meanwhile develop your other relationships so you won't be so focused on this one. 

Also, this is just my opinion, but I wouldn't communicate any hurt feelings to her. She'd probably be surprised that you had anything to be hurt about, and she'd wonder where all this came from. And it wouldn't advance your hope for an eventual friendship because you'd already be off on the wrong foot. I just think you're better off dialing it back and putting occasional feelers out there.

Good luck!"
soc_1494587,socialskills,reddit_comment,265,"No, definetly not the only way. But it could be the easiest way. 

Think it like that you have a broken machine in your home. You could fix it by yourself thats possible or you could try to fix it and you might be fail.  But if you call a repairer who is doing this as job, since he repairs all kind machines and has knowlege about machines and their possible problems, he could fix it in a shorter time than you. And i think the success rate is higher in his case (because of experience).

I dont think psychologist are only listeners. I think they will give you the practices you re looking for. But still its up to you to make an effort to get better. If you expect you ll talk and your problems will be solved, nope. The world doesnt work that way.

You can check self-help books or any kind of books that might help to you. Self help books gives you lots of homeworks to do and some of them definitely working.

And you re so young and smart definetly. Dont give up or sink into despair. You can solve this problem. You ll discover lots of new stuff about you and you ll way of thinking will definetly change in time. When you reach my age, you will be probably peacefull because somehow your thoughts will be different and you ll see the world in another perspective. And you will be able to say that what is the answer of your question and where/how did you do wrong."
soc_111040,socialskills,reddit_comment,272,"Let me start off by saying that friends, nor any meaningful lasting relationship for that matter, should be made due to superficiality.  So you not being ""100% good looking"", which is largely subjective and influenced by multiple factors, is completely irrelevant. Friendship is based off of a deep sense of mutual respect and is started by a connection due to common goals, hobbies, view points, etc.

The first thing you should question yourself about is, why do you want new friends? Do you prefer to be associated with a large group of friends, only need a few really close friends, or are friends kind of like a collectors item where you just want a lot of them? Regardless the reason*, the best way to make new friends is to pursue activities that are important to you and find people who share these view points. 

It is very common for groups to break off and go their separate ways in high school.  It's how we grow up, we discover ourselves and start to express ourselves in different ways and seek people who start to express themselves in a similar way. You will out grow phases and friends and continue to learn more about yourself.  You will do this many times in your life and each time it is natural and fine and good even if it doesn't feel like it.

*If you are only looking for friends to boost your friend count, I would highly suggest that you do not do that.  People will see sense that you are not being genuine and will never open up to you nor become your friend."

And people **can see it, it is extremely obvious**. **Extremely**.  My heart goes out to you guys struggling with this. I wish all of you could hear this. It is also unattractive platonically and romantically to everyone who is worth being friends or more with. I promise.

Let up on the macho/trying to be cooler thing at least a little. I'm not going to say ""bE yOurSelF"" because I know that's not really good advice lol. I know you do need to maintain a certain level of the trying to be cool, everyone does, even people that are naturally ""cool"", if you didn't know that. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, trolling and intentionally trying to piss people off when it isn't a joke, (or even if it is a joke that's just a bit too abrasive) is not cool. You want to act cool, well that is the opposite of it. I can relate to you on the level of struggling with your personal ""facade"", I used to struggle with that, and that's normal, everyone does, some people just figure it out earlier. 

Simplest piece of advice: talk less. Literally. Say less things. It'll make you dramatically more attractive to everyone and it's an easy default if you're struggling with things to say. Just make sure your body language is confident (good posture, chest up, out, take up more space - look this up on YouTube). You do that and stop trying to piss people off, within a month people will start seeing you differently and saying ""you've changed"" in a good way."

Sounds like a mindset born out of insecurities combined with a cynical worldview.

Perfection is unobtainable. But, confidence is. 

Confidence itself means **feeling sure in youself or your decision, not in arrogant way.. but in a realistic way.**

Some people have too much confidence, while some has way less to the point they don't even know they have it.

If you are talking about absolute confidence.. I think no one should be that confident, since no one is perfect. You're right, it's a delusion.

But, to be **confident** itself does not mean that you feel invincible, **it means that you have a good amount of confidence to support yourself.**

If you trust yourself, if you trust your decision, then you are confident. It's as simple as that."

soc_1392947,socialskills,reddit_comment,189,"We are the masters of our inner world, no one else can decide how we feel for ourselves. Often times many give their power to feel away for others to decide instead of deciding that ourselves. Another common esteem issue is when an individual overextends their ego (sense of self) beyond themselves into others or objects, tying how they feel into things we do not have control over.

Healthy self-esteem are all about internal evaluations we make with ourselves, they're not social comparisons we do with others. Others can help and influence us, but it is still only our own decision that determines how we feel at the end of the day. We don't have to let emotions or actions bring us down, our feelings are our conscious experience to our emotions. Essentially it's not the actions that determine how we feel, but our judgements on them. 

As we further increase our self-understanding through active guidance from our own self-research or a professional, we can become more intrinsically driven by our own values as we grow and continue to apply what we learn while depending less on extrinsic ones."
soc_1621941,socialskills,reddit_comment,348,"This is an excerpt from the book The Happiness Trap on how to deal with distressing memories/images:

""[I]magine there's a small TV screen across the room from you.

Place your image on the screen and play around with it: flip it upside down; turn it on its side; spin it around and around; stre-e-e-etch it sideways.

If it's a moving 'video clip, play it in slow motion. Then play it backwards in slow motion. Then play it forwards at double speed; then reverse it at double speed.

Turn the colour down, so it's all in black-and-white.

Turn the colour and brightness up, until it's ridiculously fluorescent and Jurid

The idea is not to get rid of this image/memory but see it for what it is: a harmless picture. You may need to do this for anything from ten seconds to a minute. If you're still hooked after that, try the next method.

Subtitles

Keep that cognition on the television screen and add a subtitle. For example, an image of you failing might be subtitled: ""The ""failure"" story. If preferred, you could make it a humorous subtitle, like 'Doh! Done it again!"" (as long as that doesn't seem trivialising). If you're still hooked after 30 seconds, try...

Adding a soundtrack

Keeping that cognition on the screen, add a musical soundtrack of your choice. Experiment with a few different soundtracks: jazz, hip-hop, classical, rock or your favourite movie theme. And if the image still hooks you after that, try...

Shifting Locations

Imagine this cognition in a variety of different locations. Stay with each scenario for 20 seconds before shifting to a new one.

Imagine it on the T-shirt of a jogger or a rock star.

Visualise it painted on a canvas or on a banner, flying behind an aeroplane.

See it as a bumper sticker, as a magazine photo or as a tattoo on someone's back. Imagine it as a pop-up' on a computer screen or as a poster in a teenager's bedroom.

Visualise it as the image on a postage stamp or as a drawing in a comic book."""

For example, I can talk about how I visited my family during the holidays, but that's something almost everyone does, so it's not interesting.

I'd like to try focusing on feelings more. I was taught throughout high school and college to be logical instead of emotional, so this is really hard for me. I'm not heartless, but when watching a news report about a tragedy, I care more about the victims' physical well-being than their emotional well-being. Any tips on how I can teach myself to care about the other person's emotions?

Thanks for sharing the other side of the ""slow talker"" situation. I never thought about how trying to speed up the conversation might be hurtful. My advice to be more concise would be to think about the main point of what you're going to say and only say the main point. The slow talkers in my life don't think of the main point beforehand and instead think out loud to reach their conclusion; at work, this behavior makes meetings longer and is really annoying. But this is only my personal preference, and there are many people who don't mind slow talkers, so you shouldn't change just to please others."
soc_851040,socialskills,reddit_comment,231,"There’s no easy way to get over someone like that. You have to cut off communication, take time to grieve the loss of the relationship, and move on. 

I think, and this is just my opinion, that when we are attached to someone who mistreats us, it is a direct reflection of our own lack of self-worth. I don’t know why this is, I’m not a psychoanalyst, but if I had to hazard a guess I would say that we know we’re flawed, and for someone to verify those flaws in us by mistreating us, means that they care enough to see what we see. Their choice to hang around must mean they either understand us, or they can look past those shortcomings. If someone can do that, then they must really love us, right? 

Obviously this is incorrect thinking, but that doesn’t make it feel any better. We can rationalize it all we want, but most of us aren’t rational when it comes to relationships. 

As someone who has had one of these relationships—and I still think about it years after—the only way to get over things is to commit to no contact, take your time to mourn, then start asking yourself some heavy questions. It won’t be easy, but it is doable. 

Once you sort yourself out, your relationships will be much stronger due to this experience. I promise."

The law actually is premised on the subliminal effects of how you’re feeling, which transfers into how you’re speaking, thus passes onto the person you’re speaking to.

That's the second part of this, some people are just not gonna be receptive, and you can warm them up but it's nice to make friends with friendly people, might as well. I knew a guy who literally said good morning to everyone, that worked, I smile and see if they smile back that worked, most people will let you know non-verbally whether they're receptive or not, it's just up to you to show interest and then get feedback good luck!  :)"
soc_355737,socialskills,reddit_comment,295,"Bring or buy nonalcoholic drinks like nonalcoholic beers which look exactly like the regular stuff and pretty much taste as close as you can get without including alcohol, you could sip on those and nobody would be any the wiser.

This is what is known as peer pressure, in the sense that you're debating taking drugs you don't want to take because if you don't take them you might look like a ""buzzkill"". I ask you, which is worse: being called a buzzkill or drinking just to fit in? It's the latter.

Anyway, in all likelihood, the only person who's going to be labelling you a killjoy is yourself at the start of the night, because most people can respect those who don't drink, but you've already decided you're committing some faux pas by not doing it. However, even if you're still down on yourself after lightening up and soaking in the atmosphere, just wait until the people who think it can only be fun when they drink get out of hand and end up falling all over the place and saying all sorts of stupid stuff: you'll probably want to leave, because being sober when you're around drunk people is not that great.

By the way, you're the designated driver. You will be adored for that. Even if you can't drive now, a time will come when one of your coolest functions in your group of friends is being able to make sure everyone is safe at the end of the night.

It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks about your decision not to drink, and in all likelihood a whole chunk of them will look back on you with great respect once they make the same decision later in life.

Hope this helped."
soc_775186,socialskills,reddit_comment,622,"It's definitely a struggle when you're stuck in that loop of not knowing what you offer and what you need. The best advice I got from my journey was to do things alone. To go outside alone and try things out that I want to do alone. Once I did that, I was able to pinpoint which places I actually had fun and which places I went to just to fit in. From there, the more you do it and experience the more you realize what the needs behind them are and how they're best met.

With regards to value: are you an active listener? That's value. Do you have fun? This means you bring positive energy from your presence. It's that simple. It could even be looks. You're nice to look at. Everyone will equate your value differently. An insecure ugly girl might want a hot guy to feel secure about her attractiveness so your looks have more value for her. A hotter secure girl might be willing to settle for less better looking. A person might like talking a lot and your listening skills makes them value you a lot. You might not talk much so you might enjoy that they carry the conversation. Thats their value. And it can also be more than one thing. Also, your value can attract bad people too. If you buy shit for people, thats your value, or at least one of them. You could attract entitled people who want to use you to buy things. I think you get the point. Its better to have value coming from your personality though rather than from $$$.

If you want to max your social value think of traits you value and appreciate in a friend, and hold true to them if they dont conflict with your personality, for example: holding your word and being trustworthy, being a good listener, being positive, being authentic, being an initiator, not being needy, not putting your own expectations on others, respecting yourself etc. And yes, respecting yourself and having boundaries is value as well. It makes the other person feel like theyre hanging around with a ""high status"" person. It makes them less boring to be around.

This also a bit of a taboo but maximize your looks. It's fucked how much of a difference it makes. The halo effect is real. An ugly person can be really charming and witty to the point of social dominance, but their wit is a genetic and childhood gift and pretty damn rare. It's not something you can just mimick. So people who tell you ""but this ugly friend of mine"" are missing the point. Anyways, looks are like a multiplier to your value. You can be hot and have no friends, but your personality would need to be REALLY unbearable. If you look better AND have great value coming from other places, its literally WAY easier to reach your goals. So I encourage you to exercise and groom. Fashion can be cheap but needs to fit. If youre ripped, most clothes will look good on you. I don't discourage cosmetic surgery as long as its for you to enjoy how you look more for yourself and not because you have a disorder and think you dont look good enough. There's a BIG difference. At least to me, a rhinoplasty is about the same thing as getting braces. It takes confidence to get something and not care what others you know will think about the change. In fact, ironically, if someone doesn't get cosmetic surgery because theyre afraid what people they know will think after they get it, theyre making that decision from a place of insecurity. Just something to think about."
soc_131200,socialskills,reddit_comment,358,"I honestly don't know of any, and seeing as how this has been up this long without a response, I guess I'll take a crack at it and try to lend you a hand.

Alright, so when it comes to being polite, it really depends on the situation. You mention drinks and food, and generally those are things you want to reserve for people that at least slightly know you and enjoy your presence in the first place. 

Now, I am assuming you're making these claims in the idea of grabbing some lunch with someone, or grabbing some pizza and hanging out, and if that is the case, then you really can't go wrong as long as you follow two rules. First, never go for food that they don't or can't eat. Seem obvious, but it's something you should always think about, not only in terms of personal preference, but also in their dietary and monetary need. You don't want to go out and have them regretting it with their bowels or wallet. 

Second, be proactive in the offer. Say you offer to pick up some grub on Tuesday with a friend, and the two of you are talking over the phone, and he's a bit wishy-washy about where he wants to go. In that case, offer some places that don't interfere with the first rule, and that you and your pal have in common until you find something reasonable that the two of you can agree on. If you can't agree, then either find a place that suits a lot of palettes or you both bring your own.

All of this applies for drinks in that sense as well. If it's something of whether or not they want some food you've already prepared, just ask, and whether they show interest or not, make no big deal and be happy either way.

When it comes to what to say that actually fairly well summarizes how you should be in this situation. Don't make a big deal of either outcome, and be happy with whatever they say.

I hope that's some help, if you need some more just ask."
soc_177022,socialskills,reddit_comment,594,"What you described as a moral code of you, is the usual stuff. Its not really your moral code, but this is a moral code designed by a civilized society to keep people from being hurt and respecting their privacy and their life.

What I was talking about is your own moral code. Maybe the word ""moral code"" are not really a good words for this.

If you watched ""How I met your mother"", there was a ""Bro code"" made by Barney Stinson, to sum up how friends should behave when a woman is involved in their relationship (for example: ""you dont hit on your friends girlfriend"", ""friends are always more important than a random girl"" and etc). Of course this was made as joke (however some ""moral codes"" there are good to follow), but this is an example of the stuff I mean.

You need to have your own beliefs on things that matters to you. See, for example: when you don't hurt a person, do you have this feeling of ""whether I acted ok now or not""? I guess no, because this is one of your beliefs: that you should not hurt people.

I'm kind of repeating my self, because I'm not sure how to correctly express my self (fyi: I suffer the same problem as you, sometimes I look for confirmation from other people, and keep apologizing about stuff that I think I made wrong).

What I'm trying to say is that you can't just read a book or a how to about moral codes and say ""oh ok, so this is how I should behave"". You need to decide on stuff that is important to you on a less global level than ""dont hurt people"". ""Dont hurt people"" is a very good moral code, and I wish more people would have adopted it, but this is a moral code of a civilized society. Ideally, its applies to the whole society, while what I'm talking about is moral codes for **you** as an individual. If you dont have such, you are just copying other peoples behavior and loose yourself as an individual.

I suggest you to replace the though of ""was it ok that I did X?"" with the though ""Why do I question the act of doing X?"" It will help you to understand yourself better. Try to find the answer to this question. 

* Whether is lack of confidence that makes you question your actions? - Then work on your confidence.
* Maybe you question your action because this action really does not express who you are as an individual? - Then you should probably stop acting like this. Or if you really believe that this is the way you should behave then you need to give this action a time to ""grow"" into your belief. Lets say you decided that you need to be more dominant by speaking louder. It will feel awkward at the beginning, because you just planted a seed in your head ""I want to speak louder"". But this seed still needs to grow and become your belief. While it was not grown yet, you will continue to question your loud talking action: ""am I talking too loud?"" ""what if the other person thinks I was shouting at him?"" and etc. The more confidence you build, the less time it will take this seed to grow and become your adopted belief.

I hope I made my self clearer now, if you have an more questions, please feel free to ask and Ill try to answer!"

soc_98281,socialskills,reddit_comment,192,"&gt; taking on board their insecure way of socialising

Thats quite a judgement you're making right there, just because you are doing out of insecurity doesn't mean they are. I have a few friends, including my dad, who I quite often debate with. It doesn't mean I'm incapable of normal conversation or that I feel insecure, I just enjoy it. There is something really satisfying about really ironing out inconsistencies in beliefs and thought patterns. If you went along with their debates then they probably put you in their ""people I can debate with"" social group in their heads. It's up to you to change that.

Can you define the difference between a debate and discussing/figuring out? The word is often used arbitrarily so I'm not sure exactly what you mean.

&gt;  I also suspect that pedantic people don't get on well with 'normal' people that well

Seriously, do you even realise what you're saying? you're lumping people into a group and assuming they all have horrible social skills. To the point that you're suggesting they aren't ""normal"", but ""defective"" in some way... are you projecting your own feelings onto them perhaps?"
soc_1174900,socialskills,reddit_comment,420,"If the 6th person (that was also rejected) is responsive to you (in a reciprocal way that's helpful to you of course), I say salvage that. It's at least something until time tells whether or not these 4 other people are good for you or not (and vice versa for them). It's possible that they've had good, neutral or bad intents to do their own thing without you and the 6th person. If it becomes a pattern, then we can see more informatively on what is happening... and then it's up to you to decide whether or not to hold onto them, full time or part time..  or perhaps get rid of them altogether. Let's see... I say give it 1-3 months. In the meantime, I suggest you work on your own individual life and improve aspects of yourself - in multiple areas of your life; practically, psychologically and spiritually, and then you can develop a more sophisticated and robust philosophical approach to your life. That way you're prepared for a variety of scenarios that come your way, as well as become a better person in general - that will generally help you to feel less worthless and disgusted at yourself, but also help to learn and justify the disappointment, anger, misery and suffering in your life overall in general, not just social aspects... and then as you justify your existence, you start to develop some well-earned and merited respect for yourself and make you stand your ground more competently and therefore confidently... and then if it's done well, what happens is that you do that in a way where you treat other people that way (due to your projection of better treatment towards your own self/selves and so you treat others as if they're you and/or you treat yourself as if you have someone that you love and admire dearly, want to take care of as beautifully as possible like they're of a higher deity, and have their lives improve and go as well as possible without making it worse and/or more painful/insufferable over time), new or old, and these people then become attracted to that too (especially if they approach life in that same/similar way too, as well as having their own individual idiosyncratic way as well of that proper lasting treatment, towards their own selves and of other people too) and perhaps that's where you'll find people that are good and/or better for your life, now, later, and also in the long term across time.

soc_1238892,socialskills,reddit_comment,143,"Before I begin, this is just my opinion based on my life experiences. I sincerely hope it is helpful. First I think what you’re experiencing is typical. We are all normally very social in school and at university.  That is the environment. When you enter the working world those opportunities decrease. Everyone gets busy building their life. Most socializing is superficial. It is too risky to have deep conversation with anyone but a few close friends who share your world view. To prevent feelings of loneliness, I suggest you spend more time with a few close friends. I also suggest you find an activity you’re passionate about. Give is most of your attention. You will find that you will connect with others who are also passionate about the activity and you will have a natural connection. They will become lifelong friends. Best wishes."
soc_1774442,socialskills,reddit_comment,365,"In the context of misogyny, it is difficult. Some small things are misogynistic, others are disrespectful and sometimes people just don't like what you said so they use words like that to shame you.

I can't really comment on which it will be because everyone is different. Some people aren't good at articulating their (valid point) and others don't even have one. 

If it's something you want to know more about, you can ask, ""why do you think that?"", ""can you explain how that is misogynistic? I'd like to understand"" Etc. And listen openly to try and understand them- then you can either learn something or defend the original statement.

Hahaha continuing to engage in discussions will help you get better at articulating yourself. Thinking about how others will interpret your words can also help you be effective, and focussing on facts. For example, ""far too much skin"" would become ""revealing clothing"" or ""clothing that happens to show a lot of their figure"". 

It's less judgemental, and more factual, so you'll be attacked less because you're not adding your own interpretations. Doing that will also help you to realise your own interpretations and judgements. Agreeing on the facts is also a good starting point when coming to an understanding with another person.

I don't think you should apologise every time. Of course apologise when you're wrong or could have expressed something with more accuracy (to your true thoughts), but don't just apologise to avoid an argument. Instead try to summarise the other person's perspective and attempt to relate your point to it.

Also, sometimes you will have opinions that others don't agree with. Not everyone is going to agree with everything you think. Sometimes you'll need to reflect on and adjust your own beliefs and other times brush off what someone else wants you to accept.

I've got to point out that you say other people were getting emotional, but you did too (calling them stupid). Everyone gets triggered by something, some will then explain and be more logical and others can't. That's just a human thing 😁

Obviously if you do this, they could be offended or understanding depending on what their reasons are for treating you this way. 

Another option you could do is just to slowly cut them out of your life. You have other people that you can talk to and other opportunities where you can have fun. If they ask to hang out with you again, be straightforward about the where/who/when. Don't play their games. Be strict about it.

soc_1791601,socialskills,reddit_comment,459,"Hey man, Vietnamese dude here myself. Sorry for my bad English in advance.
I have read some of your comments and can relate to your choice on how to deal with that kind of situation.

First of all for the other commenters: the problem is that ""we"" (ppl of visibly asian descent living in places where they are the minority) will always encounter peopl who will pull this crap. You can't always run to someone who will put them in place, so OP wants to know how to deal with this kind of of situation in the future.

I learned to deal with this with two kinds of strategies:

1. Serious situation (like a workplace) or you don't want to deal with that person:
It is unacceptable as soon as it hurts you in any way. If you don't know that person, they don't have the right to call you that. This should be common knowledge so why he is trying to be funny by degrading you? Either way, you should say in a serious tone, but calmly, that you don't want to be called like that. It's not right and if it doesn't stop there will be consequences like involving HR. 
If it wasn't a working place, I would say f**k off and leave me alone. I would distance myself from that person bc it will not be good for your mental health if you give that person to much space in your mind. Try to talk to friends/colleagues and get someone to back you up if the person still continues to harass you. Call it out - if you can, loudly so others hear - and other ppl might come to ask what the problem is.

2. Social situation (with friends etc.): If you know the person decide for yourself. You wanna talk with this person or not? If they try to get to know you with that kind of approach, then tell a joke that's equally racist. That will often overwhelm them and you can talk about why you didn't like the initial comment. Often ppl don't mean to hurt you, but you have to draw the line.
Some friends I always joke around with racist slurs, bc i know them and we discuss it often in the end.
If you don't know the person you can tell them racist jokes are reserved for ppl you know and not for randos.

It will not be the perfect answer. Everyone has to learn to deal with this situation (and I think that's sad but it's reality).
Learn to navigate at your own pace and don't let others push you around.

OP I wish you best luck and I hope you learn your way to deal with this."

Conversation is easiest if you know a little bit about the person. Look at what they are wearing and see if there’s anything that can be used to strike up a conversation. The whole goal should just be to get them talking and for them to control the conversation from there. 

If someone walked up to you, what would you want them to say? What could they ask you?
Do you have any defining characteristics for someone to talk about?

Well, it depends on the person, as always, but there are a few things you can do that, actually get posted a lot around. 

If you mean, to generate report during the conversation,  on the spot, the kind of things you need to do are pretty much the same you listed as positive cues: 

Follow them with your sight, only while it is comfortable, imitate their body language, get excited about what they say, bring follow up questions to what they say and give positive acknowledgement to what they say (""that is very interesting"", ""I think you are doing something amazing"", ""I like what you mean"", etc., etc.).

If you intend to be liked by the person on the long term and you will be interacting periodically, then you can do the basics of:

Asking for help for a small favor setting it up as a contribution to a larger issue (ask for instructions on how to arrive to the principal's office, because you have an important meeting, or something; for a little bit of spare change to take the bus because you are in a real hurry, etc.). Show appreciation for their time even if they didn't got to help you. 

There are a few others, but those are the basic I can think from the drop of a hat. Hopefully it will give you an idea.

The gym isn’t usually a place to be social, it’s a place to work out. People are focusing on their own training, not on who else is there that day. If anyone is looking at you, they’re probably wondering why you’re just standing there looking around.  

2) I am near-sighted, so I don’t even bother with greeting someone until I’m close enough to see their face and whether or not they are looking at me. I intentionally keep my eyes downward for that reason. Once they are close enough, I’ll look at their face. If they are looking at me, I’ll smile and nod in their direction, and depending on who it is or what mood I’m in, I’ll say “Hi, _person’s_name_!” If they want to stop and talk, I will, but if they look like they’re going somewhere (walking with a purpose) then I’ll keep moving and leave it at that.  

3) When arriving at a gathering, you can do a general wave and say “hi” or “hey” to everyone you recognize who happens to be looking in your direction when you walk in. Otherwise, you should greet the host first, then socialize with whomever comes up to you. One person giving you a hug does not mean you are now obligated to hug every single person who is there. If there’s a group assembled, say hi to the group, not each person individually.

Some people are not the greatest for support, but some may argue even a simple acknowledgment by reaching out should be the bare minimum, I guess it depends on you to decide that. 

That sounds like a good approach, because you should be able to express and say your concerns too. It's kind of weird how people think confrontation or expressing issues is seen as a bad thing, when it's normal and unavoidable in any connection.

'I'd have kids, but there's so space, thanks for having 3!'

In return, I'm incredibly standoff-ish, blunt, and I have very stiff body language that, despite my stature, can apparently come off as intimidating or aggressive. This tends to keep people away from me.
It also means I have no friends.

Now, I know that the reason for my incredible distrust of people, and buying the way I am, is because is because of endless disappointments as a kid, constantly being lied to, and having my parents try to manipulate me against each other(hence always thinking about motives), and just generally always ending up in situations where I felt used.

In a way, we think alike in the sense that we believe people can't be trusted.

Its not irrational, when you subject it to a few, but when we start believing everyone is this way, we have become highly irrational. It almost strikes as paranoia. It hurts us in the long run.

My advice is to try and find out what makes you feel this way? Not just generally. What were the incidents that you can remember that were key moments in your past in defining these feelings?
This has helped me to try to become more open towards people, as I realized that I never got a chance to connect with others because of my own behavior.

I know you mentioned being anti therapy. But therapists are actually there to find those wounds. They don't open them, they just reveal that the wound has always been there, but you've never treated them.

They are usually far away from serious relationships and are stuck in hook up culture, only similarly minded people look up to them, most valuable people will look down on them due to their lack of maturity. 

You don’t want to be like those people. Better focus on yourself, your own growth, maturity and intellect. Instead of trying to catch up with people that low, learn and grow, you’ll easily overtake them. 

Surely their folks won’t look up to you, but see them from a rational perspective and you’ll soon understand that these are the last people you want to be respected by."
soc_258180,socialskills,reddit_comment,202,"Worrying about your nervousness only makes it worse. But with that being said I know you probably forsure need to do some introspection in order to get a bit of a grasp why you are so nervous. (Or just go for it and take a non avoidance approach to interactions until you grow thicker skin)  It may be because you think people are judging something your insecure about. So what you need to do is come to terms with those things.. You can't live your entire life being insecure about things. You need to re examine your perceptions, beliefs, intentions, and behaviors. See what you do that is negative... Find out what you believe or percieve which is negative. Challenge them, because they are probably just immature thoughts you will grow out of.. And recognizing they are immature thoughts (recognizing the problem) you will be able to grow up and out of them. 

wish I had more advice. It's really up to you.. How bad do you want to hang with him? Are you willing to risk possibly looking awkward in order to possibly have a good time and develop a friendship or connection with this guy or have a good time?"
soc_211376,socialskills,reddit_comment,270,"I am going to sound harsh and preachy. 

If you really cared for her, you would not have made her wanting space about you at all and would have just been supportive of her request. 

You could have been the bigger person and said: ""I maybe hurt you in some way, I am sorry for whatever I did. If you need anything from me, I will be available. To be honest I am quite sad that you don't feel comfortable talking to me, but I will respect it if that is your decision."" 


Something like that would have sent the message in a better way than what you did. Sending something like what you did is not having yourself respected, it is called Emotional Blackmailing. 

When can you communicate again?,  I would say that not anything short of a couple of months. 

Cool your head, get your emotions in order, keep learning about people; as a rule of thumb, put yourself in the receiving end of what you want to say before you say it, and don't assume that people has to respect your feelings if you don't respect their's first. 

Only then you can try to initiate communication and begin by acknowledging how immature you behaved and apologize for it before you say anything else. Once you do that, if she still doesn't want to include you as a friend, you have to respect that and let go. 

I am sorry to be so tough, but I used to be like that and believe me, it comes from a good place.

soc_100747,socialskills,reddit_comment,168,"I think a few months ago I would have totally agreed with you but there's a few things here that I don't know if I sit well with anymore, I think if you can you should bring more excitement into the conversation, if you're an annoying person than that's bad and if they're sad that's bad but bringing energy into a conversation I think makes people likes you and can really make their day

Also leaving if the conversation gets awkward is touchy, I find most people think they're awkward and if you just leave them then they feel worse about it, if you can you should stay and then they'll warm up to you eventually, basically I just think it grows stronger friendships than just ditching when you can.

Lastly touchy topics are my favorite, as long as you don't mind listening and won't force your opinion on them it's a great way to get people engaging in the conversation, open up and build a better friendship."

soc_1113391,socialskills,reddit_comment,347,"I am fairly similar to you. I don't have many friends, don't go to parties, I just stand around with nothing to say. I don't see myself as very handsome either. However, now that I've come to think of it, most girls I approached seemed happy to at least hang out.

I think being yourself is important, but so is learning what girls want. Relationships are all about concessions. Everyone has his or her desires and as a (potential) partner you (should) want to satisfy your other half. See ""being yourself"" as your base state, and these concessions as conscious changes you make to your behavior in order to please.

It might be obvious, but there is a whole spectrum of concessions you can make: from small ones, like lowering the toilet seat, to big ones like pretending to be a famous actor. It is up to you to decide how big and how many concessions you'd like to make.

If you allow yourself to make a lot of concessions, you will find more girls, but the unnatural behavior will tire you out. If you don't make any concession, your behavior will be less tiresome, but you will find fewer girls.

I think the Pareto principle applies to this spectrum: with 20% of the concessions, you will find 80% of the girls. The other 80% of the concessions will give you the remaining 20% of the girls. So a natural position to place yourself would be around that theoretical 20% mark, i.e. do some concessions but not a lot. 

The ""be yourself"" mantra is just an indication that you should position yourself on the low end of the spectrum, if that makes sense. It doesn't necessarily mean that you should position yourself at the extreme low end.

Learning to find these small concessions is part of the journey of learning social skills, and approaching girls is one of them.

There are plenty of girls that are like us. The problem is that that means they'll also just wait around and wonder why no guy has approached them."
soc_960797,socialskills,reddit_comment,309,"A bit odd maybe and it really depends on the person if that works but: You say you listen to music all the time. Do you have a full body mirror? If yes, stand in front of that, turn the music on and start to move. Try to have fun with looking silly (you will definitely look the part in the beginning).

Don't try anything fancy, rather find some simple moves that you can repeat to almost any rythm. It's alright to be repetitive, you most likely don't plan to dance for hours straight during your first try. Rather a couple minutes and then some time back at the bar to relax.

You could look up some simple steps online, but instead of learning full-on choreographies, it might be better to just watch people dancing at the club and pick some very easy moves that look solid and won't make you stand out.

If you're dancing in front of a mirror for a couple songs each day and actually manage to find the fun in moving to music, you will eventually get better. The leap to the dance floor with people is still hard, but with some alcohol and long breaks in between, you confidence should rise. Especially later in the evening, when everyone's really drunk and almost no one can dance anymore anyways.

Or maybe even better, at a concert, where everyone is looking to the front.

Actually dancing *with* someone instead of next to someone is a different beast, but that should get you started.

(source: started dancing in front of my mirror as a young teen, mainly because I was bored and too young to really go out. I'm nothing compared to professionals, but I get complemented for it. It's just practice after all, not unlike what people do in a dance studio all the time.)"

For me, I would always intervene because there have been moments when somebody does something bad, or somebody does this to another person, and there would be nobody trying to intervene. Dozens of people ignore the situation, and it ends up unaddressed. It's kind of like the bystander effect in a way. The world is so big and everyone is so independent because we're all so busy.  Why would anybody try to help?

Maybe OP wasn't put off by the price of the item but instead by the way she felt entitled to it, and he can provide for her financially (OP is CEO who started his own company, believes in pampering himself and is his future wife/family, looking for a wife that will fit in high society events and has good personal connections), then maybe this isn't so crazy.

We don't know the whole story. And OP's situation / preference may be different than yours or mine. I appreciate your response and tend to agree with you, but just showing it could be happen.

Edit: Also you can't discount that distinct personality change that sometimes takes place. It's quite profound really. I think it stems from the girl seeing herself better than all the men hitting on her (more attractive, literally worth more as a human being), and then when someone doesn't conform to that she places them equal to herself. It's almost like the way plantation owners perceived slavery -- no one could ever in good conscious treat an equal so poorly, but slavery existed and was such a travesty because of this horrible belief that African's were literally inferior/subhumans. When identified as equals, it is clearly wrong to treat people that way. I think women like OP's date have a similar thought process towards many men, and then a huge change takes place when a certain man achieves a status of ""equal"" in their eyes -- they become extremely desirable in a sea of other inferior suitors."

This is just one of those life events that will reflect on you, and influence your image with the rest of the people in your dorm/school (depending on the size and level of gossip at the institution). My advice is not to deny it, and not to be ashamed of it. Every life event you've experienced has made you who you are, you can be proud of that, even when the life events are extremely silly. Be confident in who you are and this will not reflect on your image so severely, however, if you don't take it in stride and let it affect you negatively, people will notice, and that too will reflect negatively on your image overall.

Edit:

About your religious question, so dude I also don't believe God exists but Why stop people from doing it. Sometimes people feel sad and they feel alone and hopeless, at this time some think someone (god) is there and this gives them confidence and positive. The main objective of the god is to spread positivity and If someone is getting motivated by believing in god then let them be as long as someone is not getting harmed. I know some people do business/awful things in the name of god and that is really bad for sure.

Now about your question about society, you are definitely going to find people with different perspectives. And sometimes even objectively their opinions are wrong but your effort is not going to change their opinion so after one try just move on and just don't talk about this topic.

And to improve your social skills, it's hard I'm going to tell you this much. And also you are not going to be socially active immediately. You don't have interest in others because you have never tried to know about them. If you start talking with others, you will eventually start to care about the other person. You are going to start asking them ""hey dude, are you able to learn how to drive a car""  or anything like that. So talking can improve your social life.

Now, how to learn talking that I'm not sure but you need to start talking with others that way you are going to gain confidence."

I'm not offended, I'm giving my own general advice also. In my experiences, what's worked a lot better for becoming more sociable has been to maintain contact with friends &amp; family, and just not let introversion drag me down into isolation and solitude, rather than changing my world view and accepting absurdism as my life philosophy.


&gt;This is r/socialskills not r/socialanxiety ffs

I think it's a moot point when talking about becoming better at social interaction, really. My original comment was basically just poking fun at the generally patronising attitude a lot of this type of advice can be given with, that being all you have to do to get better at xyz is to just have a positive mindset or whatever. It's just unhelpful for most cases where someone is struggling with this stuff, and often comes from someone who's clearly never struggled with it. 

I'll admit that OP doesn't seem like they're aiming for that kind of nonadvice, tbh I'd probably go as far as to say it's not bad advice for long term improvement; remembering that we focus on events involving ourselves and incorrectly assuming the other person thinks about them nearly as much as us, is something that I'd imagine most people in this sub &amp; beyond have problems with. But most people already know this stuff, they know that these social interactions aren't big deals, but just knowing this stuff doesn't directly translate into self-improvement, in the same way that browsing /r/getmotivated once doesn't immediately improve your life.

soc_6775,socialskills,reddit_comment,402,"Okay, well let me throw my 2 cents in then. 

First, haven't you heard of all the amazing times had by all at parties? Wouldn't you want to be a part of those moments? Granted not all sound fun, BUT it's also about the excitement, the feelings you get when you're a part of something bigger than just you by yourself. 

I'm a very serious individual and nobody has ever told me I'm 'the funniest person they've ever met' so I'm worse of than the OP if anything.

Why I want to go out and get crazy, even though I never do and I'm terribly afraid to lose control: 

1) I hate how I must control every little aspect of my own life, I can't accept change and roll with the punches. I analyze everything to death. I'd just like to relax my vice-grip hold on my own life. 

2) I want to be fun. People like fun people. Therefore I want to be well liked. 

3) Fun people get laid. You're never going to get laid if you never leave your room...although online dating is kinda like this...

4) If you don't go out or hangout with people outside of work or class you'll never expand your friend group. And as OP and myself know, having a small friend group severely limits one's options of things to do. You must tailor every little thing you do so that you can fit everyone (5 people) in and so every feels included. 

**-Whereas** if I had more friends I could ditch the main group and go party with another group. Not even party. If I had different friend groups I could go to art museums, to the opera, to wine tasting events! I don't do anything I really want because my current friends don't like to do those things and I don't want to go alone. Instead they do things I don't like, so I just don't go out very much at all. THUS I am so F'ING incredibly bored all the time, I hate it. 

5) Having more friends makes you less bored and gives you more options for fun and dating. Connections will get you further than a diploma imo, sadly. 

Does this make sense? Hey this is just my opinion/baggage so if it doesn't vibe with you and you're happy the way you are then good on you, keep on! "
soc_103043,socialskills,reddit_comment,884,"While this may seem disappointing to you (and hey, I understand that), don't set your bar as high as ""I NEED to talk to THIS girl, the ONE girl, the girl EVERYONE wants to talk to"". You'll stress yourself to no end, which isn't really helpful.

Instead, why not just go to the party and enjoy yourself? I GUARANTEE you that you will meet people who are just as awesome as that girl. This gives you

* the possibility to make more than just one new friend
* more integration into the group of people throwing the party. Therefore a possible invitation to the next party, with another chance to meet your girl.
* more fun for you because you don't have to worry as much about impressing anyone

Now, if you accept this, you still need conversation starters, as you said you lack the confidence (?) to start a conversation, but once you have thrown yourself into the water, so to speak, it goes well?

How about these:

* *Hey, can you pass me a drink? I'm Jezquet by the way, kind of new here...*
* *So, how do you know [hosts name]?*
* *Hey, have you seen [friend of mine]? He's a dude with [description]...*
* *Wow, where'd you get that [food/drink]? Looks nice!* -get drink- *Thanks, cheers!* (from a bit of a distance)
* let people you know introduce you to people you don't know yet, in a charming manner (for example: *""Hey Mike, who's your new girlfriend?""* - *""Uh, she's not...""* - *""I know, just kidding. Why don't you introduce her to me anyway?""*). Just don't cockblock your buddy when you **know** he's hitting on her...

Now, all of these things have/should have one thing in common. You're not intrusive. And you give people your name (if I didn't state it explicitly, you can always put a *""Hi, I'm Jezquet by the way. Sorry for not introducing myself.""* into a conversation.

The first thing makes you look more relaxed and not clingy. And the second gives people something to hold on to; as in, you're not ""that dude with..."". You're Jezquet.

Now, what do you do when you do something embarassing? E.g., you ask a guy with a beer in his hand where'd he get it, *right next to the bar*. Laugh it off! Say: *""Aw man, guess I'm a bit blind today. Sorry about that""* Be easy on yourself.

Someone shrugs you off for asking a question? Play being a tiny bit offended, but take it easy (don't come off as an asshole. No one likes assholes). *""Ah come on, why are you so mean to me? [smile and laugh a bit]""* If they still are inresponsive bitches, just go away and find someone nicer. 

But, you still want the girl, right? As I said, don't be clingy. People in general, and women, of course, too, like independent people. Throw her a smile (I guess you already know her, at least a bit). Ask her how she is when she meets you at the bar. 

Now, to round this off, a small story of myself: I knew this girl from playing in the same music group together, and we understood each other quite well. Lost contact with her for 2 years or so, then met her again when we both just started university. We agreed to hang out again for a drink and talk about ""the old times"". I always really liked, she was gorgeous, funny, intelligent and a good person in general. We didn't meet that often, maybe once every 3 or 4 weeks when we'd run into each other on campus. Maybe she was into me, too. We cooked together sometimes, and I was sort of her date to an event where her friend couldn't attend. I was there anyway, so I followed her around all evening. At this point I already thought she'd never take me as anything more than a friend.

Long story short, I had invented her to a party at my place, wasn't getting a response from some guests, including her. Texted her, a few hours later I get a response:

    

*Hey, I know you really like me, but I don't think we should hang out anymore, I'm seeing someone...* - Bam, that hurts. A lot. The girl I had admired basically told me to stay out of her life. Only thing I texted back was: *well ok, I really just wanted to invite you for a party...if you don't wanna come, that's up to you. Just want you to know that I would never have thought I would have a chance with you anyway*

She never texted back (who would have thought).

Moral of that story for me: if you focus all your energy and feelings on that one person you imagine to be perfect for you, and you get dropped...that's SHIT. I was too clingy on her. I didn't even consider meeting other girls. ""She'll like me"", I told myself. God knows how many nice girls I missed because of that. I know this is getting a bit self-centered, but I just want to give you a perspective on things you might not consider because Mrs. Beautiful is stuck in your head.

Also, bear with me for that wall of text.

Another problem is ""out of my league"". thats a self esteem issue. so is the comment about your face. so, should you talk to this guy? sure ""hey, what brings you here?"" see if he feels like talking. yet I think that your effort might be better spent focusing on being the best version of you that you can be. imagine yourself but ""better"" someone you admire, someone who anyone would be lucky to talk too. someone who is confident and satisfied with themselves. thats just a fun thing to work on! being your best self. meeting boys is nice, becoming the best 23 year old you can be is even better."
soc_425393,socialskills,reddit_comment,288,"First : save numbers in your phone and get a voice mail installed so people can leave a message and you know who called.

Second : place a note pad and a pen next to your phone so you can write down stuff the other person says. Don't be scared to ask them to repeat themselves to write it down.

Third: prepare!! If you know future employers might call, make a list of things they could say, and the things you would answer. So if there's questions they might ask, already think of possible answers. So for example if they ask you to come in for an interview. Write down on your notepad when you are available beforehand.
Also keep a copy of your resume and stuff next to your phone, if they have questions about it, and you get so stressed that you can't remember where you went to school: the info is right next to you. 

Fourth: if you want to prepare for phone calls more, just tell them : ""hey thanks for your call but I'm very busy. Give me your number and I'll call you back tomorrow "" this gives you some time to prepare and be ready for the conversation. 


And honestly, I know it's hard! But the more you practice, the easier it gets I promise! I used to be scared to call / not answer my phone and I got to a point that I barely think about it anymore. Although if I have to make a more ""difficult"" call, I still make a list of things I want to say or ask. Just to make sure nerves can't mess with my head and I forget half of it.

Good luck!!"
soc_1276001,socialskills,reddit_comment,170,"Ima give a males perspective why we don’t like being friends with women or if they get a new boyfriend we distanced ourselves. This is just my opinion btw.

One reason is when you are friends with a girl, Especially an attractive one, it’s put a man in a weak and awkward position. For example, if we are out and about I have to deal with her getting hit on, no guy is trying to deal with that. God forbid the woman is attractive, even if we try to suppress ourselves and have a girlfriend ourselves we just simply have to much testosterone sometimes. Some men can resist many can’t.

Two, when a girl gets a boyfriend she tends to be obsessed with him and make everything about him and I’m not trying to hear about that shit.

So in short, if you want guy friends you need to bring actual value to his life, instead of gossip and other men hitting on you, unless that person is into that."
soc_154029,socialskills,reddit_comment,141,"Every person is different, but I think waiting until she warms up to you is a good idea. It can be hard for shy people to open up to someone on a date unless they already have a decent idea of who they're with. Pretty much everyone opens up eventually to someone who shows them interest and respect.

Don't feel bad if she seems quiet in person. Silence isn't necessarily a bad thing, and some shy people feel more comfortable if they have time to process things or to think about what to say. That said, if she chose to go out and was still occupied with her phone the whole time, be aware that she might be this way all the time. It's your choice how okay you are with that kind of behavior. It's not necessarily due to shyness."

soc_1454776,socialskills,reddit_comment,128,"The key to charisma, in my opinion, is self-awareness, humor, and the ability to indulge the person/group you’re talking too.

Self-awareness is good in helping you navigate situations, reflect on choices being made, and can help you be funny. 

Humor comes in many different forms, and it’s up to you to find the kind you’re best at. This just takes practice, plain and simple. You can watch stand up comedy to learn tricks in being funny. 

Lastly, talk to people and ask them questions about themselves, inserting stories from time to time. Ask what their favorite game is, and build off of that. 

So to sum it up, be friendly, self-aware, and try to be funny (which as I said takes practice). Good luck and congrats on sobriety!"
soc_1259251,socialskills,reddit_comment,191,"Low genius iq Eccentric here. Yes, you’re overthinking. 

The difference between someone working at McDonald’s who is eccentric and someone who’s a doctor that’s eccentric is one is respected for being eccentric and the other is considered “problematic”. Thus why I’m becoming a lawyer, we’re just all wired differently. 

My wife likes that I think outside the box and my “eccentric” personality. Relationships in my early 20s were rough though and finding someone who is caring is key here. 

Unfortunately there’s a few pitfalls. Eccentrics often have an aversion to alcohol and or drugs. Most of us feel as though we need to “operate at a normal level”. That personality trait is prevalent in alcoholics and drug addicts. 

Far as work place goes, fuck em. You do you. You can find 55K a year jobs anywhere. You can also find 15 dollar an hour jobs again, anywhere. It’s all relative. 

If you’re worried, I’d recommend finding a hobby you know a LOT about. These kinds of things can turn into professions if you’re a master of your craft.

Laugh at your insecurities and they won’t phase you. Personally, I love getting roasted and roasting others back, that’s my humour.

I’m 36, and from personal experience don’t rush It.  Finding what you love is important, because everything else you are looking for kind of falls into place with that.  Loving yourself and what you do helps open the doors to social interactions that have meaning and relationships blossom from genuine conversation and interests.  Use your time to try things out of your comfort zone and really explore what life has to offer.  I rushed into a career and a relationship around that age and I am just now figuring out who I am, what I want, and what’s important to me.  The first step to everything though is understanding that only you can figure out who you are, and you do that through discovery and exploration.  Seek advice and ask opinions but remember that decision is totally up to you.  Remember it’s okay to fail, forgive yourself!  You already know you want to change and better yourself and that is an important first step."

Cuz as far as I know, YOU are also responsible for not cheating too so it would be your decision to cheat, and your fault too.

soc_761717,socialskills,reddit_comment,165,"I have been in this exact situation.

And they probably have made the assumption you hate them BECAUSE you don’t talk to them. They are likely insecure, and hating you is the only way they can deal with it. 

One possible solution would be to disconnect emotionally with this person(s), as in, don’t let what they think of you effect you. It doesn’t matter what other people think. The other part of that is to talk to them at least a little, to build rapport, but remember to not give a shit about their opinion of you. Just be yourself. If they still act salty, then that’s just who they are.

soc_218666,socialskills,reddit_comment,203,"The problem is that when you always search for the next thing to say, you're putting a lot of stress on your brain to perform, and a stressed brain can't function well in any situation, what you want to do is learn to listen actively and push the conversation in a way that the other person you're talking to feels encouraged to continue talking.

It works because people just love talking, and when you are actively listening (with emphasis on actively) then that other person will enjoy talking with you and they'll open up to you.

Active listening is also a lot easier than talking, so you don't put so much pressure on your brain and then it will function better and give you all those memories, ideas, thoughts that you can add to that conversation.

Active listening is an important skill to learn by itself and I encourage you to learn it, but to put it simply you just respond to the talk instead of being passive about it, an example of passive listening would be a child listening to his mother telling him to do something and active listening is like when 2 close friends talk. (women do it very well)"
soc_297279,socialskills,reddit_comment,340,"Gonna touch a little on the ""expressing my opinions"" part. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, it's just that some people will want you to take yours elsewhere. Much like your example of views of having a child. I too think this is a depressing thought at my age. Perhaps telling the person this way isn't the best word choice. How about, ""I don't think I'm ready for a child right now."" This is quite a strong worded opinion and will stick with someone and that someone will ultimately judge you for it. Do you think this has happened to other people you talk to?  

Perhaps the people your 'hanging' with don't resonate with you. You mentioned you like to be alone at times and others are partying. Maybe you need a more mellow crowd. Do these people know you like being alone at times? Maybe this is why they don't invite you as much? 

There's also the view that other people are thinking the same of you? Why didn't he/she say hi to me at work do they not like me? Why does he/she never hang with us, do you think he/she is avoiding us? This will likely sway decisions and perhaps they think you want to be left alone. Do you not use whatsapp or other messaging apps that utilise group chats that discuss events and what's happening with the weekend?

You come across mature with a logical way of thinking looking at things from different perspectives. This can clash with stubborn people. 

Ultimately, I think you're being too hard on yourself and are having a slight complex. It sounds like you want to be liked by particular people. It's hard to advise you as it is with anyone over the Internet with limited knowledge. If it's any consolation, I am a people pleaser and change my ways to meet others needs/interests. I find it annoying and takes away individuality but after a while with them my true self comes out.

And if they are skeptical about it, try to find out why. Process changes aren't always easy and there are a lot things that might get affected by even just a small change, so if these co-workers are more reluctant, try and see what their reasons are. There might be legitimate concerns and if they're not , you can at least come to understand your coworkers better and maybe find a better way to sell your idea to them.

Also, always take feedback with a grain of salt. Not all feedback is good feedback because it can be based on personal preference.

The guy I'm talking about isn't talking a lot but when he does, he speaks loudly. That is something people find annoying. He's got habits like he always scratch his arms a lot when he is stressed or embarressed and it is weird to witness. He also tries to be funny but when he does it is a bit childish and he keeps on repeating the joke until you actually aknowledge him.

soc_1267403,socialskills,reddit_comment,915,"It depends on the person himself and doesn't have to be exact this emotion, but can be any similar once.

This topic has a lot of layers, so to fully explain it, I probably would need several hours or a full book to explain.

Let me try to shorten it up, which may contain a lot of missing side information and lead to confusion. I hope I still can somehow give you a good explanation.

Let me throw in this statement that the current school and education system is systematically educate you to fear doing mistakes, fear and avoid teaming up with other people, try to be a perfectionist. The media and tons of companies also increase this statement by adding several thematics into literally any source, so the only conclusion you can have is that what you get teached is true.

Movies for instance are sponsored by the US Army, but must only show the army in a positive light and they are allowed to add, replace and remove the script how they like. Militair people are the most couragoues and most respectful person ever, they fight for their country and sacrifise their life. But what no one tells them is that you literally get mind-F\*ed, you literally get traumatized (not everyone obviously) and when you finally leave, you can't find any job and become homeless. You may have to do bad things to other people, sometimes even little children who doesn't know it better and sometimes they do bad things to your best friends in front of your eyes and you will never ever see them again.

What do you see in the movies? They are bad ass, they are the good ones, everything is easy, the cool people, join us.

The exact same thing is happening with everything that is related to your life, career and happiness.

Movies, Advertisement etc. are telling you that you have to do several things to have a fulfilled life, get a good job and eventually earn tons of money.. yet people have several 5-6 figures debts from university and even with good grades, they have to work for McDonalds for less than minimum wage. Funny.. something doesn't seem to work here? Only \~5% have actually prosperty. They must be all bad people, all scamy and really disgusting people as you can see in the movies right? Who is the evil villian often times? You may have seen wealthy CEOs and similar. Do you really want to become wealthy, do you really want to become a CEO, do you really want to be famous? Those are only bad people, right? At least this information is literally spammed into your subconscious mind, which can't tell the difference between truth and lies. So if someone continuesly say something, it will become true in your mind. Even yourself, so NEVER combine ""I am"" with something negative! Only something positive! If you say ""I am trash"" again and again, you will eventually believe it, this is how our brain works.

You see.. People telling you ""Become a doctor! Become a lawyer!"" so people do this and eventually realize that they literally HATE these jobs. Also the ""not so high wanted jobs"" like working at McDonalds, are payed horribly and the overall quality is totaly BS too.

So what will happen with your overall emotional state? What if you don't do something you love, something you feel respected for? Something where people are positive and not literally trying to harm you at any given scenario?

You will slowly but steady lose confidence, you will more and more become depressive. Subconsciously you will question yourself, your skills, your life, your decisions. You will struggle to set any goals and if you do so, you will most likely not even try to reach them, since you have low self esteem and therefore fail doing them, start hating and disrespecting yourself. You will eventually start using the extremly dangerous word combo ""I am"" like ""I am trash..""

You may not even realize that you do this.

Our brain is very good at ""protecting"" us. Therefore it will create lies, stories, excuses so that you won't have to see into the facts, which may hurt you and make you sad.

Since 90%-95%+ of humans are doing things that they very likely don't like, their inner emotional state will suffer.

Depending on your circumstances, this progress will happen faster or slower. But eventually you will be more and more depressed and eventually even burn out.

Solution: Instead of numbing your shouting soul with anti-depressiva, stop a minute and give your inner shouting soul a listen. Listen what it's telling you and even if it's hurt, listen and try accepting the situation. Before you haven't fully accepted what the current situation is, you won't be able to change things, since when you don't accept them, in your mind there is nothing wrong, so why change at all?

The moment you accept, you may have to endure the emotions, sadness, regrets, anger, disgust etc., but once you accepted your situation.. you can also become happy. Because now you actually are able to change something! Now you can analyse whats making you sad and search for solutions, search for something that actually changes the circumstance instead of ""numbing"" the thoughts or running away from that.

soc_1493511,socialskills,reddit_comment,341,"Firstly, don't ever stop being yourself.  Being the quiet kid is completely acceptable.  If anything, a quiet person usually creates an air of mystery and can spark intrigue.  Quiet people are usually the most surprising of people because one never knows what they are thinking.

Secondly, communication is big business.  There's endless courses, information and studies on how to communicate so do some googling, reading and listen to podcasts.  The reason why it's a successful industry is because people, literally in all age brackets, suck at communicating.  So don't be too hard on yourself at 15.  

Words are only a small part of communicating as humans.  Tone, body language and eye contact are some of the things your subconscious picks up on when talking with others.  For example, if someone walks up to you and looks you in the eye and says  ""hi"" and you respond by mumbling ""hi"" as you break eye contact, turn your body away and cross your arms, they are most likely to take it as a shut down will not continue talking to you.   Instead, if you look them back in the eye, smile and lift a hand and say ""hi, how are you?""  They will be more inclined to smile back at you and respond with a ""good thanks, how are you doing?"".  Smiles are literally infectious (so is laughter). You can then respond and either ask a question or throw out a compliment.  ""Did hear what the homework was?"" ""Cool bag.  Where did you get it from?"" I like your shirt."" ""Have you heard the new song from xxx?"" And if you have something in common, that can spark a conversation.  ""You play the guitar?  I play bass myself"". 

One of the classic self-help books is ""How to win friends and influence people"".  It's got some good basic principles that you can build on for improving social skills.  But like any advice, take it with a grain of salt and make it your own.  Self-help books are not instruction manuals but a guide books."
soc_265184,socialskills,reddit_comment,731,"*TL;DR at the bottom if you don't want to hear me try to put to paper how I approach things and how I think people should be approached in detailish ways*

Aight, ima try to answer your question the best I can if I am understanding what you're asking here. So, what I believe your asking is how to handle when someone just randomly walks up to you or how extroverted people react to that, also how to approach someone. If I misunderstood sorry but I will try my best to give a decent answer to those two questions. 

So, I will try to answer the first question first. It seems in your demonstration that they're usually initiating the conversation for the purpose of being friendly and making a friend or to just pass the time and communicate. So, assuming that you let them guide the conversation right for the first question so hey whats your name and whats your major, you answer my name is blah blah my major is blah blah. Then personally I would follow up with asking about them. I believe that when a person asks a question ya know they would usually have an answer to that question themselves. Now once they answer just find something interesting a conversation isn't just like separate things ya know its one long thread. You say one thing and he continues about it talking about one of the things you said or you do the same. That is usually how I deal with that situation and if your busy just say hey hold on I am doing something or hey can't talk right now sorry. The main point of this let me try to summarize here is that they are trying to make communication with you so they're putting an effort so you just put an effort back and one thing you never should do is get in your head about it. Just speak don't think just speak if you over think well for me it hinders my ability to communicate because it isn't as genuine it is going though a carefully produced filter. Crap I felt like I got off track again but the point is just go with flow just let everything you think and feel flow out and just relax fake confidence if you have to because it takes confidence to fake it.

Aight for the second question right and sorry for the word wall by the way I am just trying to explain but it's interesting to think about your own social behavior and how it functions and works and put that on paper you know what I mean? Aight well back to the question. When I approach someone right I personally freak out but I fake my confidence I relax and I try to enjoy myself. So I usually would say hey i'm kurt nice to meet ya and then go into a topic like about an event your at or something that is going on. Since your college the major thing isn't bad at all for an opener it gets someone talking about their passion and that conversation can continue for a long time if they're passionate about it. Either way you got a in but if your not at college say you meet someone random and decide hey i'm start a conversation with that guy or girl. Then I would personally ask them about their day now knowing people in America where i'm at your most likely 100% guaranteed a response of i'm good but most of the time if they respond back how are you then you can go in depth. Say something interesting about your day or something that has happened recently and ask their opinion about it. Everyone loves to talk about themselves and what they think. But to get that point takes practice social skills is a muscle that you build for me at least. I am always trying to start something up with strangers out of the blue at random because it tests my muscle and don't be like weird about it just try to enjoy yourself always never force yourself just enjoy yourself. 

First post on this subreddit hopefully I could be of some help and thank you for reading.

soc_502183,socialskills,reddit_comment,203,"I think this urge may have something to do with the “vulnerability hangover” people experience when they open up to others. 

Many people don’t know how to react or to be validating of anther person’s struggles. I want to ask you if you have noticed the way you react when someone opens up to you in such a way? Are there any similarities?

We are all empaths, and for some of us it’s really hard to allow ourselves to feel with another person if “negative” emotions are involved. Some people are really invalidating by trying to get you to see the bright side or whatever. Others are so numb to their own pain, they may have no idea how to open up to the pain of others (hence the awkward silence that often follows an admission). 

And yes, I think it’s common for many of us to want to cut ties with people we’ve shared personal stories and struggles with. I also think these people deserve another chance, and maybe some honesty, such as asking them how they felt or what they thought about what you told them, and letting them know how you felt in response to their reaction or lack thereof.

Ask yourself if your are satisfied with friendship or you're looking for a relationship. The answer should be obvious. Remember, you have to decide between one or the other.

In either case a decision will be made. However, If you want control, you need to make the decision and stick with it. What you decide is correct.

Ask her out. If you don't take the risk, you'll simply be wasting time with someone who's isn't going to reciprocate. That feeling you have while chatting with her till 2am or when you think about her, that's your gut feeling. You have a doubt because you don't know if it's right.

Sadly, the only way you can only know and gain advantage is by testing it. In my experience, if the decision is between doing and not doing something, I've mostly regretted choosing the latter. 

If she accepts you.. well, you have a girl you like :D. That's the reward.

If she rejects you, it will hurt you like hell, and make you sad. that's the risk. Is she worth the risk ? If the answer is yes, you know what to do, if she isn't, well time  
to move along.

Failing will suck, but you will learn. Lot of fish in the sea mate.

Good luck"

And the circle jerk of a bunch of people who refuse to take responsibility for their lives continues.

Honestly, /r/socialskills - is this really a sub that's that against self-actualization? Is this really a circle jerk of ""woe is me?"" Get your fucking act together.

Now, with all that aside...

Yes, they're assholes. But they aren't going to be the only asshole group you encounter in your life. Many people - important people to not only the world, but also your life - will be this way. This is what's known as *shit testing.* It's a standard part of existence, and it matters less that it happens and more how you react to it. Everyone will shit test you. It's how you get put on the totem poles of social life. Some test harder than others. But you're never going to find a social group that doesn't test at all - doesn't challenge you in the slightest. And quite frankly - why the fuck would you want that? What's the fun in living a life unchallenged? Fuck that - and anyone who thinks that's what life's about, cuz you have another fucking thing coming, y'all. Either you play to win or you lose - there's no exiting the game of life.

Now, yes, chances are they've established you as the bottom rung of your social ladder. I know from experience. You're there to be made fun of - but you brought this upon yourself as much as they guided it to that place. This is something you need to be ready for every time you meet a group of people.

I can't link it here because I've been banned for linking non-PC help in the past, but google ""shit test encyclopedia"" and read that article. It goes over what they are, how they're important, and how to handle them. It's in the context of dating, but it can be applied to social life as well.

This is an exercise in power. You need to understand that power games are being played with you whether you engage or not - so it's best to learn to engage to win. That article will help - and hopefully engages you to continue researching the topic. 

Your insecurities will break you, at the end of the day. Chances are you are getting too defensive - and you didn't set boundaries early enough on in the interaction with this group. There are ways to do that gracefully. 

Remember - the majority of interaction is body language - say something scathing but smile and have open body language when you do it, and it'll be taken as a ""roast,"" not an ""insult.""

People here are right, to an extent. This is all stuff you most likely can't fix with this group, so it really is time to move on. But you'll be hit with the same shit in the next social circle if you don't fix the way you react to it and handle the shit tests that life throws at you. It's up to you to learn that skill."

It's a classic I think, I just stumbled upon it and read it. It's a good read and the guy gives some great advice, on women and life in general.

I seen people referring to it as ""if you're going to read only one book on dating, read Models"". I haven't read any other books on dating but this one so I won't judge the others. But it is true that it already helped me a lot.

soc_1483278,socialskills,reddit_comment,236,"Hey, I'm working through abandonement and attachment issues too.

I'm nearly 30, done my homework. It's 100% up to you if you believe me, but I have something important to say.

Focus on yourself. On how *you* can improve. Take a gentle, but critical look at you choices and ask yourself what you can do better.

Beware, really beware of seeng yourself as a victim, to whom bad things just happen. It may sound like it's bad feeling like a victim, but in reality, covertly, it's empowering. It gives you power to judge others with impunity, and the power to remain motionless, while life is happening around you.

Yet the most scary thing about being a victim is that, if the wounds are not healed, the victim never fails to turn into the abuser eventually.

You are not guilty of horrible things that happened in your family, but you are responsible for the wounds you carry now. Please, be responsible. Your life will get better, much better, if you do.

I'm saying this with love. I know how unfair and difficult it can be when bad things out of control happen. When things that are important to you spiral out of control. But you do have control over them - on the long run. Focus on yourself, on your wellbeing, get to know yourself and take rest to care for yourself anytime you need.

Good luck."
soc_1191523,socialskills,reddit_comment,301,"No, that's not what I'm saying in the slightest. I'm saying that the very few men out of one hundred who are confident enough to approach will approach everyone they see. And I said nothing about women not doing that too. That is an entirely different conversation. For the sake of this particular topic we are talking about the one or two aggressive, confident men who will pollute the waters so to speak and cause the women around them a lot of emotional and sometimes physical pain. As they say, once bitten twice shy. I get it that you are not like that and would never hurt a woman intentionally , but please try to understand that before you showed up they had a lifetime of prior experiences that taught them a certain way of reacting. And if you are going to say, ""Well, that's not me and I'm special so I deserve at least a chance,"" you are acting entitled and completely negating how she feels. If you want to prove you are different, then just toss a casual comment or compliment at her then walk away. If she is interested she'll come back. If not, then move on.

EDIT to say: it sounds like you have had your own negative experiences with women taking advantage of your kindness, and that also definitely sucks and I'm sorry you had to go through that. We no longer live in a society where men and women have clearly defined societal roles to play, and even the idea of gender is taking on many different shades of grey. It sucks and is confusing right now. We are all going to have to learn new ways of relating to each other and until then we just have to muddle through as best we can."

no matter how much they belittle your choice to respect your self and safety above the ""comfort and stability"" of the group.

This is an ugly truth about the world and a lesson you're learning early: sometimes people will choose the group or the easy way out above what's right. Friends will pick the toxic friend that has connections over the friend they wronged. Religious institutions will protect the priest or leader as they're harder to replace than the victim. Blizzard would rather change a fictional character's name rather than clean house on a toxic work environment, etc.

However, for every time this happens, a group will break off and build a newer, stronger group that's more true to values and although smaller, are ultimately healthier and pickier about who they let in to protect those who have been hurt.

This is your opportunity to start over and slowly build up a new group of people that value their ethics and morals above ""the group dynamic"". 

This isn't a mere dissagreement, this was a violation and if you'll stick around after that then some may think they can cross your boundaries however they like with no repercussion. They need to face consequences, even if its not being a part of your life anymore."
soc_1518862,socialskills,reddit_comment,362,"It will pass.  You're at that age where everyone is changing their friendship circles as you move from the regularity of high school to a lifestyle of study or work and long term relationships.  This transition for you also happened during COVID, so you've missed those few years of socialising outside of the school setting and you begin to meet new circles of people and your school group literally disperses out into the world.  There's nothing stopping you from doing that now, except yourself (unless you're country/city is still locked down ofc).

Disregarding the friends who actually betray you (because life is too short to hang onto bad friends), it sounds like you made the decision to call off the other friendships because they ""made me realise that they don't care about me"".  That's your choice.  If you're not OK with it, then don't end the friendship and organise a catch up with those people.

Don't compare past high school friendships to adult friendships because they just aren't the same thing.  You're in a completely different setting with completely different priorities.  We all went through the same thing at the same age and your old friends are going through the same thing too.  It's up to you now to determine how long this transition will take. The more you dwell on what was, the longer it will take to begin living what will be.  

Right now, you should also be focusing on your own life and not be concerned with how many people you surround yourself with.  There's more important things like family, career, a roof over your head, food, bills.  Move out of home (if you haven't already) and move into a share house to meet new people.  You're seriously at that juncture in your life where you can do anything you put your mind to.   Go be an unemployed actor.  Drive a taxi/Uber. Backpack across Australia earning money fruit picking.  All of these activities will get you meeting new likeminded people and you'll have moved on from the past.  You may even develop new friendships from there.  

Best of Luck OP, you've got this!  We all survived, so will you!"
soc_163485,socialskills,reddit_comment,300,"Good on you for recognizing that a relationship won't solve all your problems!

I think you have good ideas at the end of your post. It sounds like you're in college? Or just out? Asking someone to get coffee/lunch/etc is a great way to move to a deeper friendship. It might be good to try to get a few people (who already know each other at least a little) to come out together. That can keep a dinner from feeling like a date. When it comes to women, ask them the same way you'd ask a man. Suggest studying together or wanting to check out a restaurant. I don't think it'd go amiss if you threw in the phrase ""as friends"", too. Don't say ""it's not a date, but it could be"", even if you would like to eventually date the woman. Being straightforward about your intention is the way to put the woman at ease and make her feel more in control of the situation (IE: if she doesn't want to go on a date, she can say no). 

People typically feel flattered when you show that you're a hair more invested in them than they are in you. Not to the extreme, which is why professing love to a stranger is creepy. But showing that you find them interesting and value their company, and making the first move to invite them to something, will help them warm up to you, if they're interested.

Don't get down if you get turned down. Some people don't have time/energy for any more intimate relationships in their life at the moment, or they have their own reasons. I say ask someone 2-3 times to do various activities, and if they don't reciprocate or at least try to reschedule, move on. 

Good luck!"

I feel that I often conform to their perspective, like I don’t have the skills to present my own perspective and contribute to the convo in a real way. 

I avoid talking on the phone, I leave texts unanswered, and I lose connections because I don’t know how to check in on people or feel engaged when I do check in. My relationships feel more like work than fun, and I know that it can be not that way.

soc_1214080,socialskills,reddit_comment,456,"I feeelll thisss. I’ve been working on these same issues since 2019. I grew up being someone who always worried about everyone else, to now trying to only worry about myself and the people I choose to care for too. You’ve got to set boundaries and know your limits. It’s up to you to push past them or let them stay the same. I typically get mad! I go “I am sick of staying inside all day because I am so afraid I will do or say the wrong thing to someone and let that ruin my day and my outlook on myself! I want to LIVE LIFE!” So figure out your insecurities and weaknesses, what keeps you stressed the most and write them down. Then write down some things you enjoy, you’re thankful to experience everyday or every now and then in life. I’ve started to try and pick what emotions to fight each day. Today I am depressed and anxious, so I’ve decided to treat myself kindly and take things slow today. Listen to music, a book, video or podcast that gets me in a good mood to think more clearly about what I want from my day. Then think about what’s making me insecure (right now it’s work) and to reassure myself “hey, you’ve done so many hard things in life and life is full of ups and downs. You know more of what you like and don’t like, let’s explore our likes.” And focus on some things I’ve always wanted to put time and effort into and do that during my down time. 

Try learning a new skill, or invest in a hobby you’ve always wanted to learn more about. Having more outlets helps take away some of those stressors and can even help when you do want to connect with others bc now you have something you’re passionate to talk about too. So just know you’re not alone in this, that we all are trying to live our best life and be our best self but struggle every single day too. Find your balance, find what you enjoy, and make it into your everyday! Hell, I know a girl I went to school with who lives in LA now as a dancer and is so happy! Or a girl who quit being a nurse to study fashion in NYC and met her dream partner and is happy just living in Georgia helping women find confidence in their style. So think about who you are vs who you want to be. Sometimes you have to kill parts of your old self to help grow into your new self. Some self weeding to take out the bad that is your garden of life."

In a way, you learn to deal with all sorts of people and get along which I envy but I'm way to stubborn when i comes to toxic people because they are intolerable almost all the time, they are selfish and if you are a people pleaser like myself, they would take advantage of you without thinking twice so keep your guard up.

soc_268136,socialskills,reddit_comment,682,"She doesn't seem shy — she seems confident. She's gorgeous and she knows it. I myself take after my mother (who used to be a model) so I often get middle-aged women ask me if I'm a model or hit on me innocuously. I know I'm not out of her ''league'' whether or not you subscribe to that belief — I personally do. But just because I believe I'm in her league doesn't necessarily mean I'm her type. 

As for starring at her unexpectedly and abruptly — this has happened a few times. One time I walked into the tea room (6 months ago) and she was sitting at the table looking at her phone. She looked up instinctively to see who had entered the room. Once she made eye contact with me she quickly looked back down into her phone. After about three seconds she looks back up at me with a big grin on her face and says hi to me. 

The second time was a few weeks ago. Our store has several entrances at the front of the store — one of the left-hand side, a large centre entrance, and another on the right. I came in from the narrower and more discreet right-hand side and happened to see her right in front of me stacking shopping baskets. I was actually going to say hello to her, but once she looks up to see who's passing her by she quickly looks back down and continues what she's doing once she realises it's me. I take that to mean she doesn't want to say hello to me, so I decide it's probably easier to just not say hi so I look away and continue to walk off... Then once she realises I'm not going to say anything I hear a ''hey'' so I turn back around and she's looking right at me smiling. 

Another time I was on my way to the tea room to punch in to work. Some guy had overtaken me and was heading to the tea room as well. I decided to use him as a placeholder and watched to see if anyone acknowledged him once he entered the tea room — nobody did. I assume the tea room must be empty and follow him right in only to discover Celeste is sitting at the table eating her lunch. She has completely ignored this dude but once she looks up to see me enter she begins choking on her food in an attempt to say hello to me. 

Another time I went to the self-serve checkouts (she happened to be the sales assistant there). I was hoping to bump into her so we could chat while I scanned my items, but she was teaching an elderly couple how to use the self-serve scanners. I decided not to bother her and just snuck past and scanned my items quickly. Once I finished I quickly left and entered the mall only to hear someone saying bye to me from afar. I turn back around and she's looking at me with and looking a little concerned. I smiled and wished her a good evening and then she smiled back at me and said for me to also enjoy my night.


One day I was walking down the aisle that connects onto all the numbers aisles at the back of the store. I was looking up every single numbered aisle looking for a manager (they wear plain white shirts). Eventually, I stumble upon a group of staff members tidying the far end of the aisle (farthest from me) they're almost distant silhouettes. But then one of the staff members looks down to see who's passing the aisle and then they notice me they drop what they're doing and start enthusiastically waving at me with both arms with a big grin on their face — it's Celeste. I was so confused since I didn't know her that I completely looked away and ignored her. I remember seeing her face sink a little. 


Anyway, these are just a few encounters of many. "

You’ve got a natural filter but you can’t filter out the rest of the world because inevitably you have to face it and being able to function on the regular really does make life more simple. As you get older you realize that it’s more of the vibe you exude is how people perceive you. If you always keep others at bay they acknowledge that and won’t ever try to reach out because they know what the answer is going to be.

soc_240864,socialskills,reddit_comment,617,"Hi, I was bullied as a child and emotionally/verbally/physically abused at home.

I think there has been a variety of research out there showing how bullying/abuse is very clearly detrimental to animals, and sociological studies showing that its clearly negative to human beings.

However, while I do think the broad aspects of these results are true, it is always up to you on how you derive and make meaning from the experiences of your life.

I have had some years now to process my experiences, and there is a bright side to it.  

One, you are given the gift of fear.  You understand how awful people can be, not just the good sides of us, and you've seen it closely.  Once you process these events, you have a good idea of what abusive behavior is like, and you can actively keep at arms-length those who would inflict the same things onto you later in life.

Two, you have the gift of perspective, and by extension, empathy.  I understand the pain of others better, and while I take care not to wallow in their pain per se, I have better words and knowledge of what that pain must be like.  We all go through pain in life, and when someone doesn't know deep pain, they are unable to relate to others in a deep way.  I think this depth of understanding enriches us, even though it wasn't something we wanted to learn.

Remember, I think the majority of bullies and abusers are people who have internal pain but do not know how to express it, and so they inflict it on others.  Without my experiences I don't think I could have really understood this, and now when I do meet people who are driven by their own insecurities to inflict pain on me, this understanding allows me to hurt less, if at all from their behavior.


I have been recently reading and re-reading Kahlil Gibran, a Lebanese poet from the 20th century.  Here is an excerpt on pain, from his book The Prophet

&gt;Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses 
your understanding. 

&gt;Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its 
heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain. 

&gt;And could you keep your heart in wonder at the 
daily miracles of your life, your pain would not seem 
less wondrous than your joy; 

&gt;And you would accept the seasons of your heart, 
even as you have always accepted the seasons that 
pass over your fields. 

&gt;And you would watch with serenity through the 
winters of your grief. 

&gt;Much of your pain is self-chosen. 

&gt;It is the bitter potion by which the physician within 
you heals your sick self. 

&gt;Therefore trust the physician, and drink his remedy 
in silence and tranquillity: 

&gt;For his hand, though heavy and hard, is guided by 
the tender hand of the Unseen, 

&gt;And the cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has 
been fashioned of the clay which the Potter has 
moistened with His own sacred tears. 

It is a thankless task, trying to mold meaning out of the dust and detritus from all those awful memories.  It is enraging to feel that you have been twisted and broken by your experiences, experiences you didn't bring upon yourself, that you didn't ask for. I'm sorry you had to go through what you did, and please believe me when I say you can make those memories into helpful and positive influences in your life.  You may feel the process is artificial, that it is fake and not real, but the truth is we all choose how we decide to interpret our experiences after the fact."
soc_1572742,socialskills,reddit_comment,326,"Find a hobby that you enjoy doing. Could be anything. Art, music, cooking, videogames, refinishing furniture, pets. Having a hobby will give you something to look forward to in your life. It's the path of you and your hobby. This will give you some happiness and confidence along with giving you something to think about throughout the day. 

It's also great because when people ask you what you've been up to you can talk about whatever you've chosen as an interest. People who have similar interests, will be interested and this is how friendships are made. Or at least nice little topics of conversation.

It's really normal to feel out of place and uncomfortable in the world. Everyone experiences it even if it doesn't show. It sounds like people do often try to interact with you. This is great! It means you're coming across as an approachable person. 

It's likely a lot of your internal beliefs and stories you are telling yourself are what is really holding you back. Try and start fresh each morning and ""catch"" them. If you're thinking a thought that isn't very nice about yourself, find something to appreciate. Doesn't have to be big, it just needs to change the direction from negitive to positive. In the next 20 seconds, it's likely you'll have another thought that is similar to the last one you just thought. This is how thought patterns are made and beliefs are formed. Tell yourself you're proud for getting up and taking on the day, tell yourself your happy you made a good breakfast for your body, tell yourself it's great that you're taking your life in your hands and are trying to feel good. Bit by bit , more self appreciating content will be flowing and you'll be feeling better. Key is patience. Big changes don't happen over night, it's not giving up on the baby steps to get there.

soc_1464819,socialskills,reddit_comment,189,"I hate small talk. From what you've described, the rest of your team enjoy chatting. So perhaps you could try asking one open question every couple of hours, or every day - whatever you think is best -  to start a conversation, engage a little then ease yourself out of the chat as they carry on. Sometimes just initiating is enough to show that you're not sulking or ignoring everyone else. You could put reminders in your calendar to flag up to remind you to reach out, and you can make notes on what people say if you have trouble remembering. 

For example, you could ask something as simple as ""I don't know what I fancy for tea tonight, what's everyone else having?"". Then engage a little with their responses, say ""nice""/""sounds good"" and eventually ""I think I'll have XYZ"" then let the conversation carry on without you. Take a note of what one person was planning to have for tea, and then the next day you can ask ""hey, how was your lasagna?""

On places like Reddit, where you can be anonymous, I've seen many admit to having a imaginary world they escape to. In RL few are going to admit it. 

As far as advice... it would depend on how those inner friends or worlds affect you and your life. If they're causing you to neglect your real life, inhibiting you from living, keeping a job, keeping up with your responsibilities or preventing you from being able to be able to function in social situations, a psychological professional could help. 

But if they don't cause you or other harm or cause any of the problems above, I don't see an issue with the inner friends in and of itself. I've seen situations where those inner friends work as manifestations of a person's confidence and encourage them to improve, explore or try new things. Its more the issue that caused you to create them, ie: an inability to function socially and feeling so lonely. Its your choice if you stay as you are or decide to change and become more social in the hope you can ease the loneliness and no longer need them by cultivating rl friends.

Everything can be taken out of context when there's no vocal tone, facial expression or person who the message is coming from. It really goes against how our brain is wired.    

You have been casually texting, and there's nothing wrong with your approach at all.  Also remember people have lives, are busy, can be forgetful, and may have checked your text to remove the icons on their phone and forgot to respond. Didn't get a chance to respond when they checked it and forgot to go back. There's a ton of factors. Hell, you might also be boring to talk to through text. I have friends that I LOVE in person, that I don't like to text. I barely talk to my girlfriend through text because I don't like it.    

You can always text them at night, and they will either check it in the morning, or not. Would you send a letter to someone on the otherside of the world that would be when they're sleeping? Could you be sleeping when they receive it and start writing you back? Phones have a silent mode as well. They can turn it off, and if they don't it's not your fault at all. It's theirs if it wakes them up. If they tell you they're going to sleep, then don't text them back. That could be rude.    

As far as how long to respond and apologize, I usually say a day makes sense. I've missed texts for a few days and then gotten back to people about them. Or 20 minutes if you're in the middle of a conversation. It's all about context.    

You can also say goodbye if you want. Most people I talk to done. The conversation just stops/trails off. But that's completely up to you."
soc_1732982,socialskills,reddit_comment,386,"Honestly, it really depends on the person. Some people just don't text much. I'm in my mid-20s and I find that in this age group there is a lot of variety regarding who loves texting, who just does it out of obligation, who doesn't have their phone on them all that much, etc. I know people who turn most of their notifications off. If I need to focus on something, I will put my phone onto do not disturb or turn off notifications for certain apps so that I'm not getting interrupted. And I'm not necessarily going to tell everyone that's what I'm doing.

I'm the kind of person who enjoys having conversations going through the day. This means it's not necessarily vital for my conversation partner to respond right away. If we are trying to arrange something, or it's time sensitive, then I would like a prompt response, but sometimes it's nice to have a little more time to formulate a response before sending it. I find that sometimes when I respond too fast, I forget things that I meant to say or that could add to the conversation.

I also don't necessarily have time for every conversation all the time. Sometimes I have several people texting me at once. In this case, I'm usually going to try to triage based on which conversation seems the most urgent. If we're texting talking about video games but my best friend is telling me about a failed date he had, and I can really only focus on one conversation at a time because I'm also at the grocery store, I am going to focus on that conversation. Alternately, if I'm talking to my best friend about something trivial but another friend is struggling or needs something from me, I'm going to be focusing on that.

Ultimately, we shouldn't necessarily feel as if we're glued to our devices. I totally get it, about wanting fast responses, especially if you don't have a whole lot else going on in terms of socializing. It can make you feel lonely to see that people are doing other stuff than responding to your texts. But it's generally not personal. Humans are not always that good at prioritizing and remembering to respond to things. Most of my friend group has ADHD, for example."
soc_1781465,socialskills,reddit_comment,427,"Okay this is not really your question but I feel I can help with the specific chronic lateness (as I’m hanging with my chronic late family today) especially since it’s a very close friend. 

In my experience, there are two kinds of chronically late people. 1) people who don’t care about or value your time and 2) people with time blindness or executive distinction who have trouble generally and it’s not about you or your friendship. 

With the first group, either downgrade the relationship and how much you put into it or cut them out. Don’t allow yourself to be used. 

With the second, you can plan around the lateness. Particularly try not to plan things need a deadline (hiking, coffee/meals at a non-reservation place, bowling) or with deadline stuff (watching a game, seeing a movie/band, dinner reservations) meet them where they are and tell them ONLY when you’re leaving from there (not when it starts, not the drive time) and maybe plan a bit of cushion time for your nerves. 

With my grandmother, bless her, we always had to either tell her when we were picking her up and arrive 15 mins before or actually mean we wanted to leave 15 mins after the time we said OR ask her to meet us an hour before we wanted to meet. She’d get ready in advance (so excited to see us!) the realize she had extra time to do something else and then end up getting lost in the something else and be late. Her. Whole. Life. It wasn’t us. It wasn’t about how much she wanted to be there or not. That’s just how her brain worked. 

To tell the difference in someone who doesn’t care and someone who can’t tell time, look to the other ways people show they care. Do they call? Do they give thoughtful gifts? Do they help you through tough times? Do they bake something for you when you lose someone or for your birthday? Or are you the only one doing things for them?

The communication is a big problem. It may be embarrassment but they also need to know you won’t be mad you just need to know so you can plan. That may be something you have to say a lot before they believe you and can unlearn the shame of how their brain works, if indeed your friend is *wanting* to be on time but fighting their brain about it. It’s up to you how much of that you’re willing to take on to support the friendship."
soc_455181,socialskills,reddit_comment,108,"A possible reason they believe it's low self-esteem is because of the focus on the negative scenario. 

There is some merit to the idea that a confident person would probably focus more on how far they can get, even if they know realistically they can't win. So in this scenario, it's the choice of frame that matters.

Obviously everyone is different. For you, it might just be stating the facts and them reading too much into it.

I personally feel that statement applies for myself though when I think about challenges. I focus on the difficulty even if I say I want to improve. You aren't me though."
soc_140334,socialskills,reddit_comment,262,"&gt;Firstly, please don't mistake what I'm saying as conceited.

It isn't a mistake if it's true.  You may be good at something, but are you great, excellent, beyond reproach?  If the answer is no (trust me, it is) then whether you're good or not is a very small part of the equation.

Be humble.  There are others out there better than you - always will be.  It's up to you to add something of value as an individual to things you do.  What you add will either make things good or go sour - up until now it seems the latter.  Work on the former, find talents in those around you, try to learn from them to round yourself out as a person.

As for the ""their jealous of mah fur me looks"" attitude - seriously, knock it off.  Whether you believe it or not, if you are as attractive as you say you are then you have likely received some perks from it with or without knowing it.  The reality is that most preliminary studies I've seen online show that if you are as attractive as you say you are, you should be seen as *more* likable and trustworthy.  As such it's much more likely you are doing something counter-productive to this which is turning people off - probably making you seem disingenuous.

Ask those critical of you why they are so, take criticism and skepticism in stride while making note.  If it keeps popping up then there's definitely something going on with you that will take some reflection to answer."
soc_189885,socialskills,reddit_comment,207,"Hey, I've been there with you. I feel like I'm there now, sometimes. But you gotta just keep on keepin on, and take it day by day. Clichés aside just remember how massive our world is. How vast the universe is. We don't know what's going to happen tomorrow. There are so many variables that go into our day to day life that we can't predict the future. So if you're having a long slump, who's to say you can't instantly bounce back the next day. One of my closest friends in his mid 30's was depressed for years, hated his job, and had never been in a real relationship. Then one domino fell, and a year later he met the love of his life and got married and now runs his own business. 

So I understand it's hard to look up when you're this down. And I know how annoying it is for people to tell you to cheer up when you just don't want to, and sometimes just can't. But take it moment by moment. Embrace the unknown. You'll meet people. You'll get into relationships. As long as you allow yourself to. Wake up everyday hoping for a wonderful coincidence. All it takes is one. "
soc_1559842,socialskills,reddit_comment,517,"""Don’t be afraid to be controversial""

But I am.
Not because I want people to agree with me, but because there are so many idiots out there that if I start being controversial, for example by having an opinion about a movie someone cant agree's on, they tend to put me in a position where I look dumb, where I feel like they didnt do enough research but still want to argue and disagree.

And this happens way too often, its like everyone I talk to is entitled for their opinion but not me.

So the best thing was not to have any opinion and keep shit to myself, which is really bad because then nobody wants to talk or deal with me, because Im boring if I dont have an opinion and try not to talk about anything which can lead to a disagreement on a stupid level.

The worst part of all this is those who disagree, are mostly those who have no idea what they are talking about, even tho the topic is something you're 100% confident about. 

I have to say tho, I do know how to agree with someone's disagreement, if their disagreement makes sense in my eyes. If not, I try to stick with mine and just try to explain my view, if they still disagreen, I apologize and try to quit the conversation. Usually doesnt work tho and there is a fight.

If you talk about a topic Im really good at and someone comes along who is really bad at it, they have a skill to make me feel shit, so it looks like they know what they are talking about but Im the ass of the group.
I hate it.


Its basically a vicious cycle where people want you to have an opinion just so they can disagree with you and put themselves in a better position, no matter what. What you say about that?

What Im doing currently is fixing my body language and the way I appear infront of people.
I think its about confidence, if there is not enough of it, doesn't matter how right you are, they will see you as weak, disagree and try to put you below themselves. 
So if I look more confident, physically and mentally(also face language, looking at someone while talking to them for example), they tend to back down and actually be REASONABLE. They still disagree, ofcourse, but on another level, on a respectful level.

But one more thing is more importantly than anything else: 
NOT GIVING A SHIT, and not just ""not giving"", but SHOWING that you dont give a shit if they start being unreasonable.
Making that ""resting bitch face"" if someone starts to be unreasonably disagreeing, trying put you down. Or anything really.
Thats what works, but has its dark sides.
There is no best solution, it comes down to how you want to be perceived by the public.
Some say ""fear is respect"", I disagree, there is a thin line, and I surely don't want to be feared, but I want to be respected."

Big awful stuff is so hard to keep in but even harder to let out because you don't want to be a Debbie downer, so make sure they know that you're not annoyed or weirded out that they shared, just showing some empathy and being understanding should do it.

He's never stabbed me in the back, he's never betrayed my trust, and he's never given me a reason to believe he would do either of those. 

I agree with this. However, considering that everyone is different, there are those that it works for. Albeit, it's probably only a small amount of people it could work for, if we are in fact talking about the majority. 

It's not at odds. It's actually the foundation for why I think this way. Everything I listed in the beginning of this thread, stems from this mindset. Everyone knows this, they'd have to. It's just the most prominent thought in my mind when in a romantic relationship. It keeps the trust, communication, romance, even the fun out of it because I can't stop thinking about it.

1. Fill you conversational arsenal. Read, pick up hobbies, go do interesting things. Make your life interesting and fill your brain with knowledge. 


2. Find your people. I feel blocked and awkward with 90% of people, but the other 10% it just flows without thought or effort or overthinking. People like us can't just flow with anyone.  Itll be obvious when you find someone you can talk to because it will just happen. Just do whatever you think you need to do to find them. It's tough because it's not always the people with the same hobbies or interests. Once you start finding them, you may see a pattern which can further help you recognize people you might get along with. 


3. Listen, and get good at asking questions. People perceive conversations to be better when they were talking more.

The reason I'm asking the questions is because a LOT of this stuff is very subjective. It depends on how you feel about your interactions with the people around you. 

If you own your introversion (I call it the ability to recharge), then it can be a great thing. But if you feel uneasy and anxious about it, then why not take some steps to ease that feeling?

soc_1031340,socialskills,reddit_comment,326,"This is a new/recent culture. I hate that it’s this way now, because it can cause this effect on many people. I am the person that does not respond right away. Something about everyone having a phone in their pocket now, it’s _expected_ that they saw the message and that they reply. But, I personally think it’s sucks to have that expectation hanging over my head. Because... I don’t always want to be available/accessible to all my friends/family/acquaintances. I just don’t. I have family members that feel slighted if I don’t reply within a few hours while I am at my demanding job. I think, in that case, maybe I should be the offended one because I’m actually busy. What makes them think that they are entitled to MY time while I am working?

Look at it this way: maybe some people don’t like to feel like they have to be “ON” to answer the multiple messages they receive. It’s totally not your fault. It can get exhausting to hold multiple conversations throughout the day with people that aren’t in front of you. It’s double duty. You not only have to tend to your family/co-workers/customers/ but you’re also expected to tend to the people in your pocket? 

Don’t carry that, it’s not you. I agree with other posters. Find something you’re happy to spend time doing and divert your attention to that. Write/Text/send DMs to people, but get in the habit of not expecting an immediate reply. Think of the old days, pretend that your message was a handwritten letter/note and they will “hand write” you back when they have a chance. Disconnect from the idea that they have your message in their pocket and they were active on social media before replying to you. Just “write the letter” and stamp it and hit send. You did your part. The rest is not up to you. Keep your head up &amp; stay safe out there. ✌🏽"
soc_1532863,socialskills,reddit_comment,140,"Rule of thumb is usually if people hang out with you they like hanging out with you. Now you’re concerned she’s just spending time with you because she feels sorry for you. Good signs of having a good time are laughing (not smiling), having conversations but also being able to endure silence and not force a conversation if there is nothing to talk about. Another good sign is if the person feels comfortable with you. Are they relaxed and can be themselves? Do they open up to you about things that are on their minds. And also the quantity, the amount of time you spend together, matters. Is it (half) regularly?

soc_385592,socialskills,reddit_comment,791,"I understand where you're coming from, but at the same time I have to disagree. It's not about putting effort in it's just the reality that the people you talk to are just like you. They have they're own expectations, hardships, lives, etc. Youre not going to always find people like you, those are rare and, sometimes fleeting.

Everyone is different, but the fact is we can't live without some form of human/social attention, a feeling of being needed and wanted by others. The fact that it bothers you to describe it as ""giving up"" or the use of depressive language shows how much you want it not to be the case of destiny.

It's not.

It's a case of probability and what you do to yourself. I don't know you so I can't/wouldn't judge you, I don't know what's going on in your life, but:

Are you sure you're going outside your comfort zone?

 When you make these attempts to get to know people are you reserved in trying/learning new things? While you do want to make friends, are you willing to try new things or go the extra mile with questions?

For example I had class with this girl and I started up a convo, I said ""hey how's it going?"" 

She said great, I mention something about the class in a good spirit and I say, ""my names RazzyTaz"" she tells me her name, we talk and I ask about basic things like why are you in this class? What do you do? 

She told me she runs a start up Tea company, but I don't usually drink tea or coffee, but still I keep interest by saying,

 ""Oh you run a tea company with your sister that's cool! I'm not much of a tea drinker, but I've never really had any good tea (which was true). What do you enjoy? She goes on and she mentions how she's trying a new church sunday, that catches my ear (listening is half the battle) and I ask"" are you an avid church goer?"", she says yeah, she had been going all her life (it's something important to her). I consider myself christian, but I don't go to church and it's not something I would want to go to. I tell her ""That's cool, I consider myself Christian,  but I haven't been to church since elementary school"", and she invites me to go to church with her for easter. 

Here is where people diverge, they either say no, because they either might have something important (like work etc.) Which is understandable, or they don't want to go, because it's too far out their comfort zone/interest.

This was FAR outside my comfort zone. I may be christian, but I'm not a go to church, bible reading one.

But I said yes, because it shows that even though I dont have much of an interest in what you do I'm willing and trying to get to know you on a more than basic chat level. We exchanged numbers, I went, I got to meet her older sister, had a great time, met the pastor (who's now here boyfriend lol), she invited me to meet and have easter dinner with her fam.

Just last week we hung out and went bowling with plans to do other things in the future along with texting.

We didn't have much in common, but even though that was the case I found a way for us to share a common ground and build a frienship. It doesn't mean I have to go to church with her from now on, or anything like that, but it's something I'm willing to do, because being open to new things is the best thing about life for me.

I consider myself a intro-extrovert. I was the guy who gave up making friends after freshman year, because I moved away to a new city and was fat and afraid of my appearance, and became a depressed, filthy, smelly, dirty roomed mess who was tired all the time and had random fits of anger and sadness and didn't know why.

It was because I was mad and sad at myself for losing myself to obesity and no social life. I wanted to be an extrovert, that was always me, I wanted to be the althletic guy people wanted to talk to and there was no reason why that couldnt be other than me being afraid to grow up.

I'm out of HS I'm no longer depressed, and I'm striving to become a better person and that starts with communication and friendship for me.

Even having online friends is a good thing I had those too and those count as friends in my book. "

That's a great thing. Maybe now you're wondering if there's a little too much of that. Maybe you're considering loosening your limits a bit. 

If that's the case, you don't have to go to the other extreme, just try it a little at a time and see how you like it both in the moment, and over the next few days/weeks as you reflect on it. Maybe instead of your usual two beers an hour, you aim for three and see how you feel. Be around friends you trust when you do this. Maybe it's in a more controlled environment like your place, or a calmer pub rather than a club. The point is, tweak one variable at a time and see if that's enough to scratch your itch. 

As for the casual sex part, it's obviously personal preference on whether to make sex more of a romantic and exclusive act, vs. casual and hedonic. It sounds like you've already considered your perspective on that, but it's difficult to know how your eventual partner(s) will feel about it. You may abstain from casual sex or sex at all and find the love of your life, but she might not like your lack of experience in the bedroom and she leaves. Or she may love that you treasure that and you two have a core value in common. You can't truly know what others may like, so do what you feel is best and try to avoid any enormous regrets.

One might reject everything just because considering the alternative might give hope, and hope most times ends in pain, so rejection is a type of defense mechanism there. Maybe there is an identity association with the issue, so unconsciously there is an immediate rejection, because if it ends who am I? It could be just to avoid seeing oneself as 'stupid', if it's this simple why haven't I thought of it before? Of course it's not stupid, just a normal human phenomenon. We're clearly not the most insightful when we're emotional, especially when it's subtle, it's not intense but it is there. That's why we give great advice to other people and mess up our lives. Others who accept readily without a thought also have an emotional investment, in this case finding shelter for all the pain they're feeling.

As we're emotional creatures, those pitfalls are inevitable. Now if I emotionally reject something does it automatically make it true? Not necessarily. Here where awareness shines once again. Just the awareness of the inner workings of our minds is enough, because through it we can see our blindspots and understand them which gives us the space to accomodate the opposite view and see which of our psychological issues are involved. Experience, Internalization, Psychology issue, emotional need."

Looking weak is bad and I stand by that, we are still animals, for a reason when spooked they try to look bigger than they actually are.

If you have never hit the gym then try it for some time or get some housemade weights, and if you have in the past and you didn't like it well that's just your personal preference then. This is for yourself and your health but it also helps your image so."

When shr twirls her hair or does something extra cringey-flirty, you could: ask her a complicated work question, ask her about her boyfriend, or (this is effective) curl your lip into a sneer/frown to show just a little disgust

Stop texting her outside of work hours. Block her number or put her on do not disturb.

If the direct approach doesn’t work, you need to decide if this is infringing on your work, or sexual harassment, if it’s worth escalating to your boss. Simply “hey boss Ginny is over here at my desk all the time. it’s distracting.”

But when you do it yourself maybe you are not conscious of it and you think omg I don’t want to text right now I don’t want to think of a reply. Or maybe you are focuses on the message you are sending that you don’t actually acknowledge that you are sending a text and talking to someone. Instead next time you are texting someone even your mom or dad or brother or sister. You need to realize hey I’m texting too. I’m saying you made a post saying that everybody texts except for you. But I’m willing to bet you have text messages already. Why don’t you just acknowledge that you do text already you don’t have an issue.

The coolest people are texting their mom their dad their friends. Everybody can do it. Just do it and recognize when you do it already. And then you realize hey you are not the odd one out maybe some people just like texting more than you do. Hope that makes sense"

I bet in the next 10-20 years your natural eyes will come into mainstream fashion, and you’ll be rightfully praised on how good looking you are. Beauty standards are fickle and say nothing to your personality. There is no such thing as “Resting Bitch Face,” only relaxed faces and judgmental people. 

Ultimately surgery is a very personal decision, but I will say that it makes me really sad to see other people with ethnic features they’ve carried for generations suffer with self image because of beauty standards that favor european features, while those same whites can wear ethnic features like an accessory and be praised for it. I promise surgery can not give you the results of a filter. Filters automatically smooth your skin texture, make your eyes unnaturally bigger, and change your face shape. No one looks like that in real life without EXTENSIVE work and professional makeup ie. kpop models. You are perfect the way you are, and it is not your job to regulate how people perceive you from across a room.

soc_951678,socialskills,reddit_comment,260,"No one ever just comes up to you and says, “wow, you look cool, let’s be best friends!” Relationships form slowly and little by little sometimes. I’ll give you an example, I saw a dude at the gym the other week and noticed he had a shirt of an artist that I love. All I did was point at his shirt and said nice shirt and gave him a fist bump. My plan was to just say that and walk away, I didn’t really need it to be a full convo. But he started asking me about artists I like and stuff and then we exchanged Snapchat to send each other music. I see him regularly at the gym and we can talk lifting and music, so we already have things in common. I don’t think we’ll become super close, but at least it’s a familiar face, and if his friends are there he’s introduced me before to them. 
Opportunities to network or make friends take a little bit of effort by you to stick your neck out a little bit and engage others. Sometimes you have to go outside your comfort zone and start the convo yourself, or make a comment to someone that you wouldn’t have talked to otherwise. But it has to be genuine, don’t just say someone has a cool shirt just to say it. And they might not even think anything of it and just say thanks and walk away. But you have to practice approaching others like that to have those opportunities open up"

There will be shy people in that crowd. There will be people who think that they themselves are awkward. You're going to be find. Don't separate yourself from the crowd. Everyone's unique.

What you have to do is find similar interests. Talk to the people who you sit with in class. Make comments about the topic after class or when the teacher is not teaching. Ask how they did that homework, or how they did on that test or what they thought of that test. Maybe ask if they want to help you study even though you don't need it.

If you live in dorm. Try and talk to people there.

If you enjoy going to the gym. Talk to people there, ask them to help you with your set. If you're playing basketball at the public in door gym, ask to join their pick up game.

You can be shy and that's okay. But sometimes you will need to initiate because a lot of people feel comfortable and even shy. They feel too comfortable/shy to reach out. Sometimes we have to do that ourselves and start the conversation."

However, I have just made a new best friend and in just 5 months I feel like I can talk to her about anything and go pretty deep too. Im a guy too btw. With my former friend (a guy), it was really hard to talk about deeper stuff, so I've realized that sometimes it's just the person.

its been pretty surreal for me to be able to find a new bf in such a short time, but it just goes to show that it really depends on the person. if you notice that they like to just stick with small talk conversations, consider moving on or at least lowering your expectations about the relationship haha. to me it does help that my bf is a girl but like i said it depends on the person. lucky for you, you said you can meet people easily so eventually you will find someone.

so yeah find people with similar hobbies or interests, spend time with them, and maybe try getting dinner so then later at night you can start trying to get deeper when the late night vibes kick in haha. just making sure, but dont be afraid to open up when the time actually comes. and also put in some effort in asking questions too. its a 2 way street! good luck!"

It's hard to point at the specific nature of the sharing, though 'too much too fast' is probably a good heuristic. But really, it's more about a lack of mutuality in the engagement. With the right context, sharing vulnerabilities can actually be a great way to form a bond IMO.

Some examples or analogies that might be helpful...

* Someone comes up to you and says they think you're cute and asks for your number. You find out 60 seconds later that they've been asking *everyone* in the area because they're desperate... you're actually the 47th person they've asked today. There's a certain disappointment that comes with realizing that this person doesn't want *you -* they want a relationship with *anyone,* and you just happen to be there.
* You meet someone at work and they're talking about a sad part of their life. You console them. The next day they're talking about another sad part of their life. You console them. The next day you suddenly realize they've never asked anything about you, and indeed have no idea who you actually are. They're talking about another sad part of their life.
* You meet someone who share with you their struggles. You also share some of your own struggles, though they interrupt you to bring it around back to themselves. The next day they update you that they're feeling better about their situation and change the subject whenever you try to share your own experiences. But they're feeling better now at least!

In all of these (unfortunately real-world) examples, all of these people are self-focused on their own lives. Their difficulties are real and they deserve sympathy for sure, but they're also treating the humans around them like non-playable characters or emotion vending machines. 

Ultimately, the above people are not in a place where they're genuinely interested in the particular humans they're interacting with - they're only interested in whatever emotional validation they can directly extract and try to minimize the amount of attention/affection/validation they have to exchange to get their own good catharsis out.

A good test to see if you're guilty of this (and imo, everyone is guilty of this from time to time) is to think of someone you've opened up to and ask yourself: what is *this* person's struggles? What are their main values and ideals? What are they hoping to do with their lives right now? If you're realizing that you haven't really tried to learn about that person, it can be a sign of an imbalanced dynamic."
soc_225910,socialskills,reddit_comment,529,"Your 'hints' are not nearly enough. They're waaaay to subtle, and it seems like you just hover quietly expecting people to know that you want to do things instead of saying so. Like your examples:

1. I would never **ever** take that to mean ""Please can I come to your house to give out candy"". I mean 1, it seems like a weird thing to invite someone to do - like fine invite someone to a party, but inviting someone you aren't close to, to just come to your house and give candy to kids, is not something I think would occur to anyone. That was not the 'opening' you think it was.

2. They told you when they'd be there, it was up to you to then say ""Cool, can I have your number and Ill come find you guys?"" or ""Ah I'll maybe see you there then"" or whatever. Again, your 'hint' was actually just something people would ask in normal conversation, and was not actually a clue that you'd want to meet them. And the reason you couldn't make it is the perfect example of why people don't ask unless they'd made concrete plans - most people don't want to be force to explain why they didn't attend something, especially when they didn't explicitly say they were going. Seriously, you asked when *they* were going, but it doesn't seem like you even said that you wanted to go.

3. Does anyone know when it is? Do you remind people before hand? This is the only one that's kind of on them, but it seems like they aren't close enough to you to remember. Maybe next time you should try ""Oh man my birthday's next week, does anyone want to head out for lunch with me to celebrate?"" sort of thing.

4. You aren't close friends, they are. You don't actually ask to attend **anything**, you just stand quietly as other people make plans and then wonder why they didn't invite the girl they barely know to come with them. They have no idea you'd even want to, and most people don't just invite everyone standing near them to every plan they ever make.

You should stop doing so much overtime though, if you aren't happy doing it. By agreeing every time, you're just letting people think that you're happy to do it, so of course they'll ask you.

You have two options here - you could give up, because it seems like they aren't that bothered by not being friends with you. But if you want to be friends, then you need to start being proactive about it. Actually make it clear that you'd like to attend an event you're interested in, or try inviting *them* to stuff. The whole ""If I just hover in the background they'll invite me"" thing doesn't actually work in the real world - nobody invites their coworkers out for a shopping day when they're going with their friends, unless it's to intentionally help the coworker make friends. But they don't know you want that, you don't seem to show any interest in being their friend. Your coworkers are not psychic."

soc_15153,socialskills,reddit_comment,164,"Confronting social stigmas is generally unseen, as people tend to small talk, or talk about the weather, or a common interest, or anything really. As these topics don't make the other party feel awkward. And through this, both people become friends in the process. After that, confronting mixed signals between both parties shouldn't be awkward, you can laugh at it, and build upon it.

As for advice? I'd say simply try to get to know her better. Get to know her likes and dislikes, see if you have common interest. Ignore 'mixed signals', it could just be her personality not opening up to you because you don't know her that well. If you become close? Well, that's what you wanted right? If you don't, well she's simply not a match for you. Friends are chosen, not given. You must choose your social circle, and it should be with people you feel comfortable around.

soc_1419165,socialskills,reddit_comment,224,"For me personally, anti-depressants were literally a life-saver! I was worried it would change who I was or make me numb, but it made me go from my emotional base state being ‘kinda bummed’ to ‘fine’ or ‘content’. It’s genuinely made such a positive difference in my life because heading into the day feeling good/happy gave me a lot more emotional stamina. 

Like for example, if I wasn’t taking anti-depressants and something bad happened, I would break down crying and wouldn’t be able to stop for an hour or so—it would completely ruin my day. But now that I’m on anti-depressants, if I encounter an obstacle, I’m able to emotionally handle it and keep going. It won’t make me break down or ruin my day. 

I also have less suicidal ideation—it rarely happens anymore—as well as much less brain fog. My memory is a lot better when it comes to past experiences. 

I truly can’t understate the great difference it made in my life, and I would highly recommend anti-depressants to anybody who even struggles with mild depression. It can equip you with the tools that everybody else has to make your everyday life much easier and happier.

I can't, however, help you to find the way of stopping it. But maybe knowing that he really likes your friendship could make it less awkward. Maybe ask him to be sincere with you. The solution is up to you.

I know people who smoked everyday who told me “they know they could quit at any point” but I don’t buy that. That’s just going to be an excuse to keep smoking, and it’s the addiction playing tricks with you.

But the guy above is right, *she* has to want change first and foremost. I talked for years about wanting to quit before I finally actually did, because deep down I still liked it but wouldn’t admit it. I had to reach the bottom before I finally decided I had to quit before it destroyed my life completely.

She’s not crying out for help. She’s talking about quitting because it helps relieve pressure about doing nothing to help it happen. It takes a lot of effort. Support and talking about it can be a help, but ultimate it’s your life and your decision. At one point or another you have to stop talking and start taking action. But the catch with weed addiction (and many other substance abuses I figure) is that it makes it incredibly hard to take action. You get tired, procrastinate, and push things off, AND weed makes you comfortable doing nothing to change that. You can sit for hours on end looking at your phone without getting bored. 

The real challenge is changing out all the habits that weed creates. You have to change a lot of things and just do more to keep yourself occupied. You’re going to feel like things are boring and life is stale, until you learn how great it feels to be productive and make an effort. That’s definitely the kicker. So many times you want to just take a day off and smoke. But a day turns to two days very fast when you’re an addict. You got to keep going. You have to let go of a lot of comfort aswell. She’s been used to this lifestyle, every single day, so letting go of that will feel scary and like you have to start over and let go of something that has been a part of “you”. Your identity takes a hit and it will hurt. I bet OP’s gf will have a lot to deal with once the smoke clears from her brain and heart, and she will really feel the weight of the emotions she has been putting off/hiding away.

Again tho, it’s all going to start from within. OP can be supportive, but that could also end up pushing her away, you never know. It’s very hard to help an addict, the only thing you can do is make them help themselves."
soc_495538,socialskills,reddit_comment,350,"Epistemology. How do they know if they're right or wrong when they criticize? They're not you, and the heuristics they believe apply to what you should do in your life to achieve success, are simply heuristics that may have worked for them in memorable situations, or that they're guessing could help you out in situations they haven't personally experienced. If you like, your goal could be to ""doubt them"" - to hold what they're saying mentally at arm's length, to just regard their remarks without instantly accepting or rejecting them as truth. What the people around you are criticizing you about are heuristic suggestions to do something else. (...or, less charitably to these people, they might be complaining after the fact with 20/20 hindsight about the outcomes of a judgment call under uncertainty which you reasonably made. But hey.)

Sure, it's ok to perceive the comments as negative. What happens if you're negatively commented upon? You said you feel defensive about it. Alright. That's fine. It's ok to feel defensive and to defend yourself. You're making decisions now and then about heuristics to use, and people nearby might criticize your choices. But you're alright. We don't need to pick optimal heuristics and carry them out with optimal efficiency. 

Are you sure your friends are on eggshells around you? Maybe when you're feeling bad, they perceive how you feel, react sympathetically, and go easier on you / choose to be present with you because they're kind, and because your choice of heuristics isn't always that important.  We don't have to call their care for you walking on eggshells. It doesn't feel great to feel bad, why rub it in and make you calculate alternatives, increasing your stress, when there's no need? If you want advice from your friends when you sense that they're being nice to you due to your evident mood, then just ask 'em for the advice directly.

It's alright to get your heartrate up when your hear criticism. Grin like a maniac. Revel in it.

uh, was any of that good? I want to get my heartrate up"
soc_645441,socialskills,reddit_comment,290,"This is something I've always been very good at (as opposed to actually maintaining friends). Do keep in mind that this is what works for *me*, I'm only sharing *my* personal experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Planning is good. Very good. As another user mentioned, think up a few of the most likely outcomes and plan viable responses. Some people will inevitably behave like pricks, so it's good to be prepared.

However, make sure not to plan too much. Once you start overthinking, it'll just make you more afraid, and then it doesn't matter if you have an A+ plan up your sleeve.

Your focus should be to actually *get up and start walking, get down and start talking.*

This is easiest done in a public setting, like a pub or a bar, because most of the people there are in a social mood anyway. In such an environment, take notice of your surroundings, have a drink or two, sit down for a little while, look around. Don't be reclusive, participate, at least passively, by not sitting in the darkest corner of the room. And then, say you notice a group that catches your attention. If they're approachable (whole other topic), just get up, walk over, and just say it the way it is,

""Hey guys, not to bother you, mind if I pull up a chair? Out on my own tonight, thought I'd come over and introduce myself.""

&amp;#x200B;

Sounds cheesy, right? Hell, it is cheesy. But think about it. If someone came up to you with a light-hearted smile and a bit of confidence, would you send them packing? Most people wouldn't, and most people won't. And if they respond rudely, they're complete asses not worth talking to anyway.

soc_1215932,socialskills,reddit_comment,205,"To be honest, just be yourself. Its as simple as it sounds and used many times but you can't force yourself to be liked by everyone ya know? If you sound emotionless, then its how it sounds, you can't make yourself sound better to be full of emotion. 

On the contrary, I would definitely support in your decision to be more sociable if thats what you'd like, but in my opinion I'd just be happy with how I am.

Think about it this way. Even though your coworker asked you this question, she still talks to you til this day and although some people might think of you as less social than others, its your choice to go out and make conversation with others or be comfortable where you are ya know, so it shouldn't matter. 

As long as you have a good personality and a good heart, you shouldn't really focus on pushing yourself to making the ones around you like you when you can be comfortable in your bubble. 

There are times when being social is expected of you, but it should never be something that you should strain yourself with as it doesn't come easily and definitely takes time. 

You got this!"
soc_375232,socialskills,reddit_comment,211,"If you're serious about building up a tolerance to crowds, I would recommend going to festivals, concerts and pubs, rather than clubs. Festivals, while they are crowded, have areas you can isolate yourself when the anxiety skyrockets and you need to relax. Concerts are a great place for people to just watch the music. A lot of people end up talking to each other for no reason other than the band, so try that if you want. Pubs are enclosed and tend to be a little bit smaller, but they are significantly more relaxed. Some of them even have dance floors for people who want to dance to DJs or bands or whatever is going on. 

This is completely up to you, however. Trying again is a good idea if you want to adapt yourself to the club environment, but don't force yourself too much. Clubbing is only good for trying to get sex quickly; I have only met a handful of people who want to genuinely go clubbing and just dance. The rest are seeking validation in a crowd of people that want their validation first. It's all it really is.

You did a stellar job going outside your comfort zone though. Congratulations and I hope the best for you!"
soc_513559,socialskills,reddit_comment,308,"Have you ever heard of deep house? It’s a music genre that is pretty groovy. It’s my absolute favorite kind of music and every now and then Los Angeles clubs will have my favorite DJ playing. I always go alone, usually wear my best outfit, and I wear sunglasses (personal preference). Then I get there a bit early so it’s kind of that awkward stage when people are buying drinks and just standing there waiting for more people to go in.

Well, I usually just go to the wide open middle of the dance floor and just dance. I dance the night away, feel it in my hips and just deep in my soul. I just keep dancing and hearing the music and sometimes drunk people will dance with me or cheer me on and I’m just there with my sunglasses, outfit, and just groovin’. It ends up being the best nights of my life because I’m just enjoying the music.

The first time I did that it was one of the hardest and scariest things I’ve ever done. But now I go to nightclubs that have my favorite Dj’a and just dance the night away and I actually make friends, mostly people who are just having a good time like me.

Long story short, please just go. You may regret it or you may have one of the best nights you ever imagined. When you get there you will see people you recognize, go and say hello! Ask them to dance.

If absolutely no one is there that you know, then just dance, and if you can’t dance just move your hips! Do it for maybe 5 minutes and if you’re over it, then you can go home and know that at least you went! 

Best of luck. Have fun with life because the days are limited! "
soc_79297,socialskills,reddit_comment,281,"Getting rid of Facebook completely helped me with that. You'll come to find out that the really important stuff is right in front of you, and the connections you make with the people you care about are more important than seeing or being tagged in pictures of people ""out having fun"" every weekend.

This is not to say you can't go out and have fun. I'm also not trying to sound sanctimonious about not having Facebook; it was a strategy that worked for me. But I think as an adult you are perfectly capable of determining what is and isn't important. For example, I'd much rather enjoy a dinner with my closest friends than go to a house party and play a game with people I don't have a true connection with beyond partying. I learned a lot about myself once I stopped and thought about with whom I could have a real conversation. At least 75% of the time, it wasn't the people I was playing Kings with.

It is important to know HOW to socialize in groups, in personal situations and, for example, work functions. However, there is a very large difference between understanding how to socialize and feeling the necessity to be overly social. I function well in social situations, but I don't feel the need to be at every event every time. 

Just my two cents, try to stop over analyzing (which, TRUST ME, I know is easier said than done), and take some time to reflect on what moments in your life have been significant and memorable, and WHY. For me, it was the people I was with -- not the biggest party I went to. "
soc_234736,socialskills,reddit_comment,220,"I doubt people were glad that you are gone, maybe they just don't know you very well which is why they weren't greatly affected by you leavjng.

Anyway, since I don't know much about you, I can't tell you what you are doing wrong that falsely shows people that you have a negative personality. Like I said, look at yourself from a 3rd person view. Picture yourself as some stranger you just met, how would this stranger interact with you? Does he sound close-minded? Snobbish? Etc.

That say, I noticed a lot of people who are shy or have social issues tend to appear close-minded. Therefore, I would hazard a guess that this may be your issue. Some examples of being close-minded: someone asks you for help and you spent a decade analyzing whether it will benefit you or not.
Someone cracks a joke about you, you dwell on it and get offended the whole day...etc. 

I really hate to use bad and good to describe personalities because imo all personalities have their own strengths and weaknesses. However, we are living in a time where social media has influenced us to believe that we should all strive to become that cheerful, open minded party guy with lots of friends, so, it is in your benefit to develop a ""good"" personality.

They may or may not be doing it out of animosity, but if you're feeling like crap and aren't really contributing, it's best to call it a wash for now and find other people to hang out with. If they ask, tactfully tell them why and see how they react. They're your family, they're probably not going to abandon you completely just because you're off doing your own thing, and if they really *do* feel better without you there (harsh, I know), they'll probably accept your decision without too much fuss. If, on the other hand, they really *do* want you around and are completely unaware of how you feel, they'll probably invite you back and take your concerns into account.

Another example- my dad doesn’t have any friends and he is the kindest person I know. His reasoning is that people just grow apart or that he never really found people he clicked with.

soc_303290,socialskills,reddit_comment,368,"I feel you man. I also used to struggle with that, especially in environments I'm not familiar with - maybe I was open while being with a small group of friends, but when it's complete strangers everything feels stressful and it's draining the will to live out of you. When that's how I feel, I'm not going to have any fun whatsoever and it shows in the way I come across. Obviously it's not great for parties or any social situation for that matter. 

My number one tip is practice, practice, practice. You said you feel like it's tiring like a workout? If you work out long enough it can become fun. Being around other people can be a challenging task, but the best way to feel more comfortable in a situation is to experience it as much as possible. I tried to use any opportunity I had to be around people, even though it's very much out of my comfort zone. Living in a shared apartment with 14 partners and volunteering for a year helped a lot, as even getting up at night to take a piss could become a chance to talk to someone... After a while I noticed how much better I could handle basic human interaction, and my confidence skyrocketed. Basically if I know I'll be able to handle most things others say or do, and carry myself socially, the anxiety drops noticeably and suddenly it's way more fun to hang out with anyone and everyone. And the only way to get better is through practice. 

Apart from that I also developed some techniques to help myself get out of my own head and in the same fun/extroverted/energetic mindset when I know a social event is coming. It has a lot to do with how you make yourself feel: taking a power pose (using confident body language to make yourself feel confident, regardless of how you really feel that moment), blasting music I love and singing along loudly and horribly, or even calling a close friend and running jokes for a while. Maybe there are different things that would work better for you, but it's up to you to find them. Good luck :)"
soc_1068723,socialskills,reddit_comment,188,"People are shitty. This is an issue for all of us. It’s just a part of adulting. 

One group I worked in was super toxic. Gossiped about everything and everyone was a victim. I tried to stay out of it, only seemed to make it worse. The only effective solution was leaving and working in a different group (same company). 

There’s always a few gossips. This in and of itself is the basis for the entire real housewives shows.

My best recommendation is to ignore the best you can, know that they are petty and are literally taking jabs at people with no basis other than the fact that they are terrible humans and this is how they get joy. It has nothing to do with you. I say “don’t take it personal”...you give me a look because it’s not really possible...just maybe like take it 50% personally.

I'm also wary of subtle manipulation based on people's belief in me. At the end of the day, you gotta decide if the relationship serves you, as the person dealing with those kinds of people.

soc_1512756,socialskills,reddit_comment,351,"I'm single (m27) and shy, but I'm not actively seeking a relationship either.

I have sort of a distain for the modern dating life depicted and advertised by modern media. I believe that natural and organic relationships build over time and mutual interests rather than ""love at first sight"" (not saying you do). However I'm usually too busy with life to make time for social hangouts that would facilitate such relationship building as friends and as a result; don't put much effort towards ""finding the one.""

If I were to enter another relationship, it would have to build over time and through normal, non sexual and non romantic encounters before it could mature to the point where I would consider it.

I don't need someone to validate my existence, and I don't need a financial partner. So the bar for me is set very high as to who has even a passing chance at being involved in my life to the degree that I'm going to invest in their involvement. 

I'm happy for those that have found enrichment and purpose in their relationships regardless of the origin of introduction. But my personal standards are higher than ""hey, we like each other and the same TV show or movie, so let's date""

Some guys are like that, some guys don't need all that pretense to have a happy and fulfilling relationship. 

I think it's different for everyone and for every personality type. But my advice would be to be happy with yourself, and pursue what makes you happy in life and allows you to be yourself. And if you meet someone along the way that wants to be friends long term, those are the strongest relationships to build from. But it should be genuine in all forms, not just a hidden agenda to get in your pants. 

Being single can sometimes be a blessing in that you're not being subjected to the roulette wheel of flings and bad relationships. 

Also, relationships are taxing on a person's personality and choices in life.

One more thing to add, not clicking with people the first time you meet them doesn't mean anything. Some of them are more closed than others, maybe they can't express themselves openly enough to make a connection with you. Show some interest in them, what they do, etc., nothing wrong with some chit-chat. Friends won't happen, you have to work for it sometimes.

In grad school I leaned towards the quantitative side of psych, there's no way I could do the dailies in a counseling gig.

This was exactly my problem in my teens. I was very skinny, people were constantly making fun of me because of it and it resulted in quite bad self confidence problems. I thought that no woman will ever be interested in me. After I started working out and doing sports (I later settled at kickboxing), a lot of this changed, I gained more self confidence and women started getting interested in me (likely not because of the body, but because of the healthier self confidence).

I used to experience this exact same thing, I started watching a few self development videos and started to change my mindset. You are a product of what you surround yourself with, if you are constantly putting yourself down, you will absorb that subconsciously. To fix your mindset you need to find the root of the problem and fix it. It's evident that you are not confident, so ask yourself this: 

Why am I not confident?

 1. Are people around me negative and have bad mindsets? If yes, cut them out of your life!

2. Do I undermine myself? If yes, write down a list of things you're good at and things you like about yourself such as positive traits, achievements etc. Read this to yourself every day (Find ways to grow this list)

3. Do I feel like I'm not good enough? If yes, replace the, ""Am I good enough"" with ""Why the fuck not?""

4. Am I ugly or overweight? If yes, take a few months or longer to focus on you, start training, have a skincare routine, work on yourself. (Improve on your strengths, strengthen your weaknesses)

5. Stop watching porn, it is bad for your mental health, semen retention has a lot of benefits, do some research on that!

6. Detach yourself from outcome, don't enter a conversation thinking about the outcome. Go in with the intention of having a conversation.

7. Remember this, only insecure people will put you down, so why seek their approval in the first place?

Judging by the thousands of upvotes and hundreds of comments, I'm betting that you have received an overwhelming amount of advice and wisdom. And I hope you take it all to heart! If you're not sick if reading comments and parsing advice, consider this stuff here:




Sounds like your emotions have reached Rock Bottom. Well, you can't go any further down from there. But your emotions aren't the only aspect of being human. 



Physically, I'm betting you're not half bad to look at, if you've spent as much time in the gym as you say you have. Keep exercising, k? And join some group fitness cardio classes or a yoga class. It's fun, and it's healthy for you, and you can make some casual acquaintances, which can blossom into a fully organic friendship. Just keep it casual at first, and make sure that you go to the gym / cardio class / yoga studio FOR THAT THING ONLY. The other regulars at those places will respect the F out of you for it. They will slowly warm up to you. 





It sounds to me like your professional life is in pretty good shape. You've come very far and you are close to achieving a master's degree. That is incredible! I personally crumbled under the stress of trying to complete a 4-year nursing degree, and decided to stop at 2 years instead. As it turned out, that was plenty good for me anyway. The pay bump was big enough to help me dig out of debt and furnish a lovely apartment that truly feels like a HOME to me. Finish your degree, and find yourself a HOME, not just a nice place to live, and make it your opinion of beautiful. Because you're so freaking close to finishing that degree!





Don't poop on your personality traits. Being a nice guy isn't a horrible thing. You mentioned in your post that you felt worthless. You're not. I think you overlook the things you've achieved and you despise your positive traits because they haven't gotten you any sex or feminine companionship. But mark my words, once the stress of school is over, you'll have (what feels like) endless time and (hopefully) plenty of cash on hand. Don't spend that time moping. Spend that can on several drinks at a bar, just not too many! Go early in the evening (yes, seriously, early) before everyone gets sloshed, and don't go on the weekends, because that is what people do at bars on the weekends. You won't make a solid connection with anyone that way!





Mister, I've been in a similar position as you, and I could keep typing out advice ball night, because I feel like many strong similarities exist between us! But if you only take away one thing from all the advice you've received from your post, try and just take this one thing: don't beat yourself up, and don't think too hard about all this stuff! You'll only think yourself into more misery. PM me if you'd like to chat more! I how you read this and I hope we can chat!

IF they're undecided, i usually say something to uplift them like im sure you'll find out what you want to do.  There is something you like to do right? :)  

I mostly talk about them and what they're into.  If you notice they seem to be a little bit annoyed then its time to back away.  You don't want to be the pushy interrogation guy.

All they have are words and drugs for you just like the rest of the world. It's up to you to figure out your place here and do the work to bring your mind and body to a place you can be happy. I'm telling you the same thing a therapist woule but for free!

I don't think you're right about not seeing joy to be abnormal. What the hell are you even saying when you say normal anyway? I've been chronically depressed since 12, had friends die and take their own lives, met a lot of other people who have been unable to make any forward progress in life because they're so crushed by the weight of their own pain. Sure seems normal to me. I don't think you are appreciating the magnitude of pain that exists in the world. A lot of us fall through the cracks."
soc_615250,socialskills,reddit_comment,328,"The word friend can mean a whole variety of things.  You can be generous w the term or very selective and pedantic about it. It is up to you. A friend to me is a ""state of being"".  Not a label i put on someone permanently or even for a set duration of time mandatorily.   

As you say, trust has a lot to do with it.  I believe it is an integral part of the definition.  As well as allegiance ( due to a common cause, beliefs set, unified vision.. so this also includes the will or want to understand the other in communication) or loyalty. These three are the transcendent factors in friendship.  

Other things like: common interests , fellowship , having a conversation, being in close proximity to each other, ability to be uninhibited w each other (joking or flirting), etc, are strictly minor compared to those three (but can have an influence to those three perhaps).

You have to discern it.  Is there a mutual loyalty and trust w these fellers? If not, i would say they aren't anything but just good acquaintances.  But that is me. You may discern differently due to your definitions you set.  But to open up liberally the defining of friend will perhaps wreak havoc on you emotionally as the term in this society wields a lot of weight and value and we can't overlook that.   

Don't fret though.  Lot of you young ones are still learning to be a man or woman.  Maybe they are still children in their minds. You seemingly are not.  Better to see them as little brothers but not as friends perhaps. And move onto more of individuals at a level where you are at, and if you want to keep these guy friends earlier give them some time to mature (hopefully) into someone who can be attuned to and sensitive to others rather than just self centeredess and learn more about trust and loyalty."

soc_1811815,socialskills,reddit_comment,262,"Thank you so much! I think the thing I struggle with is that I can't understand the nuances of it. Like, yeah, I know all of those gestures GENERALLY mean something like ""I'm your friend"" but there's so many greyscales I can't tell apart.

I also tend to really suck at reading body language. So as a result I just *don't* touch anyone so I don't make them uncomfortable - I'll see if they are, but I freak myself out way before I even try because until someone's ugly crying I probably won't take a hint that they would like a little less words of affirmation and a little more hugging.

Basically, I'm a world champion in not breaking anyone's boundaries around touching, because I neither understand the when nor the why nor the how, so I just... don't. Which also doesn't work because over time people will just file you as weird or as not liking them too. I don't understand why anyone would demand I wrap my arms around them instead of actually listening to the problem and trying to offer support at fixing it, it seems pretty unhelpful to me, but either I have the wrong friends or I'm supposed to read their minds.

Its even worse when just meeting people, because they'll often hug each other to introduce themselves and I get to pick between coming off as already hating them when telling them to get out of my space or guessing the socially acceptable kind of touch they're going for. It makes me feel like an alien."
soc_303471,socialskills,reddit_comment,321,"There is a difference between being alone and being lonely. Not saying you're one or the other. I'm just saying there is a difference. 

Some friends of mine are going out tonight, and I wasn't invited for some reason. I feel like I'm only good for short term things and no one is really interested in me in the long term. 

I've always been like this. I was excluded as a child and now I'm not good at trusting people. I have few real friends. I think people need to learn to be alone. Sort of learn to cope with it. In the end, we are alone in this world. Our friends and family won't always be there for us, and we need to learn to be independent. 

Happiness does in fact come from within. Once you realise this, you will be able to find happiness everywhere and find the positive in the negative.

For example: ""My ""friends"" are going out without me tonight."" There are so many positive things you could derive from this. You can do all the things you want to do that your friends don't want to do with you. You can go out. You can make new friends. 

I've been in your position before. I watched some people I thought cared about me get together and then they posted it to social media too. It is not a nice feeling. But you will hopefully find people who do care about you. If you don't want to be alone, you don't have to be. Go out. Anywhere. You will find someone. Literally anywhere. Like even just go to the supermarket and casually strike up a conversation with someone. Whether or not it goes further than a conversation is up to you (and the other person a little bit). But you won't get anywhere unless you try. And if you don't ask, the answer will always be no."

I personally wouldn’t want to risk making someone else feel alienated or upset for the sake of satisfying my own curiosity. You use the example of Italian people, but that’s not an ethnicity - asking someone their ethnicity is specifically asking what their racial makeup is, which of course implies it’s important to you for whatever reason, and therefore could be misinterpreted.

I used to have the same kind of problem, and looking back I wish I would have even thought of wanting to speak more to my teachers, like you.  I never gave it thought, I was just tense about it, and dealt with it.  

But talking to authority figures is like doing anything else...catching a football, shooting a basketball, talking to girls, returning something to a store, or whatever it is that is uncomfortable.  Its practice/repetition.  But start slow.  Friday ""Bye Mrs Smith, have a good weekend, don't party too much.""    Monday, ""SOO, how was your weekend?"" with a big smile.  Or if that is too much, just hi and bye, or thanks for helping me on that question earlier, I appreciate it.   Stuff like that.  

Its normal for many to feel this way, so understand and remember that, because sometimes just those feelings and thoughts make you tense.  When you realize its normal, it may take a little of the edge off.

edit, also, progress at your level.  If hi/bye, how was your weekend is too simple for your, ask them about where they graduated from, or their family, or more personal stuff.  Its up to you.  But I always think its good to progress slowly and get comfortable in what you talk about.

soc_1457632,socialskills,reddit_comment,375,"You already seem to know. 

People like other people who are fun, funny, and entertaining. People don't like boring, dry, dull, or too serious. Most people like people who make them feel good, and who don't make them feel bad. All together, those things are called being charming. People love charming.

So tell her what she wants to hear. Don't tell her things she doesn't want to hear. Make her feel good and appreciated. Don't make her feel bad. Do not be judgmental, and do not criticize. There is no one size fits all solution for this. You know her better than we do.

""I think that what makes a person interesting is their personality, the way that they express themselves, the experiences that they had to share, their live styles, the friends they have, their jobs and their hobbies, and I have nothing of that.""

Just don't be too serious, but still be polite. Don't talk about politics or religion, unless if you both agree already, and even then you won't agree on everything, so it's best to avoid it. People subconsciously mimic emotions. Don't be too literal or too formal or too predictable. Be fun. Make note of anything funny that you see happen in your life. Don't talk about sad things unless if there is a happy ending. Everyone loves a happy ending. Don't be too literal or too serious. Everyone loves a ""good story"", so embellish and tell the story in a way that other people want to hear it. Then everyone will think you are great at telling stories.

""live styles, the friends they have, their jobs and their hobbies"" Just make an effort to go out more, do more fun things, and diversify your interests. Find a fun social 'cool' hobby that keeps people entertained. Some big ones are singing, dancing, acting, comedy, music, traveling, eating out, and sports. People also really love things like astrology and fortune telling, but a lot of people also hate astrology and fortune telling.  Whatever you think she likes. If you like movies, then you can make impressions and quotes from famous movies, or say ""that reminds me of"" and refer to a funny part of a movie. Lots of people love that."
soc_44538,socialskills,reddit_comment,255,"You remind me of a friend, actually.  He's a decent guy, has his own interests and makes decent comments.  The trouble is his timing is terrible (he'll try and ask me about my work whilst we're out in a club) and he's not good at talking about himself.  Plus, he can be quite slow on the uptake exagerrating his already staggeringly bad timing.  
Step one - if you can't talk about yourself in a humble and engaging manner, you're going to seriously struggle understanding other people.  After all, it's your best topic and people like to talk about themselves because somebody else taking an interest in your life is flattering.  Imagine somebody coming up to you and being genuinely interested in why you're doing engineering, where you're going with it and why you like it.  Surely you'd enjoy that?

If you want to be fun to talk to then you have to approach conversations from different angles.  It's not a linear thing is talking to somebody, it's dynamic and you have to get that into your head.  It means that during a very deep and serious and conversation about something you can just bring out an offensive joke to relieve the tension.  You need to add value to a conversation so if you aren't witty and charming already then it's about time to be - everybody appreciates these two qualities in anyone.

Be honest and gracious in your questions and your replies.  You'll notice a dramatic increase in how more receptive people are to you."

If you show genuine interest in that subject, which is to say that person, you will make a lot of progress in your friendships. You need to get their guard down and let them open up to you. However, good friendships are balanced, so you need to open up a bit as well, but usually wait until you’re asked. You can always offer up some info unprovoked to show that you trust them, and for the sake of furthering the conversation. 

As far as being funny goes, don’t try. Just let it come naturally. A good tip for life is to **always seek balance**. Too much humor will make you seem careless. Too much confidence will make you seem cocky. Too little of each is just as harmful. If you feel like you’re forcing your behavior in a certain direction, then you’re not being natural."
soc_975529,socialskills,reddit_comment,198,"I think this last post is probably more to the point, in that you've always been you at every party you've been at. 

There is certainly a bit of an art to 'sequestering' one or two people at a party that you want to share deeper conversations with. Finding those quieter spots that allow for more complex interpersonal exchanges. By and large, in a free flow seating situation, this is always possible. 

But more importantly, its up to you to start and hold the conversations that *you* want to be a part of. You're the only one who knows what would be satisfying for you to talk about, and not-starting those conversations means you are relying on pure chance in a situation heavily weighted against them. You have to create the opportunity, or it just wont happen. But if you *do* create them, and develop the skills to maintain them, then they happen almost every time. 

In this way, two different introverts attending the same types of parties and the same types of social situations, will have very different experiences and outcomes, leading to two very different perspectives on what sort of social potential any given party holds."

I don't think you SHOULDN'T place fault on them if they were shitty, because for some of us it helps to meet others who have been through similar situations.  That's how I met people that were in my life for years until life happens and we had to go our separate ways.

That said, as far as using descriptions which are landing as... racist? Is that the main issue here you’re encountering, sounds like? I’d say there’s three things worth being mindful of ime:

1. Sometimes ppl respond out of overcompensating for their own biases. I’ll often challenge these responses gently with something along the lines of “Why does that detail about them automatically land as a negative for you?”

2. Language and culture change and evolve sometimes, especially these days, fairly rapidly. How conscious are you being of the culture around you and settings you’re in? Is it possible you are using objectively benign/neutral terms w/out paying attention to what is or is not acceptable in your context and to your peers?

3. Its always worth doing a spot-check for self-awareness imo. Sometimes, ppl DO have a point. Sometimes we ARE showing our asses in some kinda prejudice we may not even be consciously aware of. Was that info actually relevant to what I was trying to convey? If not, why DID I feel the need to include it? Maybe I was just being verbose or descriptive or whatever... but maybe there was a value judgment there that made that detail color the situation/story in my head (and thus be relevant to share) in a way that MAYBE isn’t a value I actually WANT to hold n maybe IS worth addressing in my OWN self.

If none of those seem to fit? Well then its just useful info on the individual you happen to be engaging with at that time. XYZ terms don’t land well for them, for whatever reason, copy that, good to know; will stay away from those in our future interactions out of basic respect for their comfort zones whether or not I understand them."

Low comfort level on your part could be because of your nervousness or thinking too much. Regardless of why, it's very obvious to people. When you look uncomfortable or tense, people get uncomfortable and tense too because of our empathy. We read that body language instinctively. When you're feeling nervous, your shoulders go up, and your face gets very tense. It's going to help if you learn to recognize it and relax your body. If we seem relaxed, others will relax too because the empathy works that way too. I'm one of those people who piles through awkwardness and discomfort, and one thing I know helps connect a little more is show vulnerability. Self-deprecating humor done tastefully is one way to do it. When you establish good comfort levels, people will naturally open up to you. Deep conversations should happen only organically if you're not very close. One thing you should know is that not everyone wants to talk about those deep things.

It'll be stressful and exhausting knowing your friends will leave you if you ever drop your mask.

""Just Be Yourself"" simply means be honest, don't mask your true personality and intentions. That way you will only attract people like yourself, people whom like you, and people compatible with your personality. You'll never have to mask or worry about driving people away; from minute 1 they know who you really are.

If you can't 'Be Yourself' because you think you have a bad personality, it's up to you to change that. Growing into a better person is still 'Being Yourself' because it's up to you to define who you are, and who you want to be.

If they're about to drive drunk, if their breath stinks or if they're going to talk to their crush at a party but said crush hates them, honesty is going to save them a lot of trouble. It's not always going to be appreciated, though, but neither is sugar-coating.

Unfortunately, there's no right answer in these situations. Honesty breaks hearts and empathy causes heads to be buried in the sand. You can be honest without being a jerk, though, which I feel like is often the best option.

soc_1679600,socialskills,reddit_comment,501,"Here's something to keep in mind: the difference between nerves/anxiety and excitement is a very fine line. Excitement is just anxiety but with proper breathing. 

I'll get back to that, but first here is something really important to consider:

You are completley normal. What would be abnormal is if you remained completely calm and unaffected by members of the opposite sex you're attracted to. 

Human are so hardwired for sex that we LITERALLY start to have chemical reactions when we're around someone we find attractive. Our hormone levels shoot up, dopamine and norepinephrine course through us and make us feel loopy, give us jitters, make our stomach do flips, and give us insomnia and loss of appetite. 

That is real. The only people who don't are probably just good at hiding it, or actually have something wrong with them.

So knowing that it's normal, just breathe through it. Whatever works for you, but personally when I have to maintain calm when I'm worked up I use a simple 4 count in / 4 count out breath (quiet, continuous, not ""deep breaths"" just normal breaths basically) and I can actually feel it working: the feeling of terror turns into the feeling of being a kid on Christmas morning in fewer than 10 breaths. 

This is physiology, nothing more. You're still going to feel all those butterflies and flushes and racing heart beat, but the fear will dissipate. And it can start to feel fun!

I've been married for 7 years now, but I still think back to how much I used to LOVE that feeling on a first date. You can actually learn to love and look forward to the exact feelings you're describing as being so uncomfortable now. It's a GOOD discomfort!

It even serves an important function of conveying attraction: people can pick up on this energy, this altered hormonal state, and it can actually be a positive signal. When I went on dates and I saw completely calm unaffected girls, I was like ""nah this isnt happening"". If their eyes were a little wider, they were laughing a little too much, if they were peeling the label of their beer bottle, if their skin was flushed and they seemed edgy... I considered that a sign they were into me, which can be a really great feeling!

If you're in high school or something and people are going to make fun of you or whatever  you might need to play it cool, but out in the real world, there is absolutely nothing wrong with letting someone you like see they're working their magic on you.

Rejection will happen but that's a different story and a different advice thread.

TLDR: Mastering social skills is about breathing through the awkwardness and jitters NOT preventing them from happening in the first place. 

(That would only be possible through drugs and alcohol -- which I have definitely used to calm my nerves around the opposite sex but it is not what I'm recommending here.)"
soc_968357,socialskills,reddit_comment,247,"You dont have to try to fit in at all, I dont. I think its a good idea to not just bypass relationships for no reason though if they present themselves to you. My opinion is that you might as well try out new relationships, just dont have any expectations for them. This way, if they disappoint you its whatever, but if they’re good for you then it’s a pleasant surprise. 

Also this is just my own philosophy, but dont assume the worst of people, or at least dont express it if you do, even though you’ve been wrong many times in the past. That would be you unjustly taking your frustration with relationships out on people who dont deserve it. Just because you dont have any expectations for someone, dont treat them as if they dont have value (even if you truly cant see it). Doing this, people will be drawn to you and be at ease with you, while wanting to show you their value if they respect you. That is the most successful way to earn beneficial relationships in my opinion. 

In conclusion, I agree with you- relationships aren’t inherently worth anything. Personally though I have decided to continue to search for a relationship that is worth investing in, because I hope to create value. What you do is up to you and I dont think there is a wrong path, just different paths. So just take it a day at a time.

soc_399606,socialskills,reddit_comment,340,"I think, not to sound harsh, you should try to shake up your lifestyle a bit for a period of time lets say 45-90 days (up to you how long) to detox yourself a bit, just do this as an experiment.

During these 45-90 days do the following.

1. Cut out all soft drinks, alcohol, unless special occasion and only drink water, and lots of water.
2. Make sure to eat a healthy diet, your food affects your brain.
3. Excersize at least 3 times each week and get your heartrate up.
4. Meditate morning and evening, this really helps with anxiety.
5. Go out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself both with day to day tasks and also in your social interactions.
6. Cut out close to all social media and video games cold turkey. 

6.  Might be a sensitive subject but If you watch any pornography cut that out completely, its toxic if you have anxiety. Now i wont tell you to stop masturbating but try to keep it down to 1-2 times a week maximum, that way you can use and transmute your sexual energy better which will make you more energetic and feel better in social interactions. 

I did this myself and I have had some quite terrible social anxiety, for me the porn and excessive masturbation was my biggest problems and after i cut those out i started to feel a lot lot better after a few weeks. 
I Kinda had the same problem as you and always felt numb and bored and anxious around people, but then after i did some nofap (tip dont read to much of that subreddit, most of em are crazy), i felt more vibrant and alive and started to enjoy social interactions more and more, while also getting rid of my anxiety 

Last reminder, just do these steps now for the coming 45-90 days as an experiment, its not ment to be your lifestyle forever, if you dont want to, just try it and see how you feel.

Don't be afraid of that Dad persona fading. It's obviously up to you how much authority you want to maintain, but it sounds like your kid has his head on straight. So I wouldn't be too afraid of losing Dadness and starting the transition to being equals. Besides that, I don't think smoking or drinking with your son has to ruin the dadness. He should understand that Dad is an adult, adults can use substances in moderation and enjoy themselves, that's the grand goal of life in the end anyways.

I know when I started smoking weed, I had a lot of guilt about it, that I was no longer this innocent boy who please my parents with good grades and nice behavior. I ended up letting it become abusive/habitual, I wish my dad would've smoked with me. I even figured out a few years later he was a stoner! 

Remember the Oedipus Complex. It is your sons destiny to kill his father, whether you like it or not, and you can let it happen gracefully or you can put it off until he snaps. And he will snap, but you won't see it, he'll do a great job hiding it. This sounds a lot more serious than it really is, but it's the truth. "
soc_698665,socialskills,reddit_comment,285,"This is why middle school sucks. For some reason there is so much value placed on what everyone thinks of each other. People are worried about ""fitting in"" and struggle even more with confidence than they already are, at a time they're trying to figure themselves out. This causes a lot of pain for people in all sorts of ways. The good news is, you're not alone. All of us who attended middle school went through this mess in some way. Your struggle is valid and unique to your own experience, but please don't feel like you're the only one who has ever felt out of place or excluded. (I'm with you!)

That said, I know this is easier said than done, but try to control your self-conscious thoughts. Work on dismissing them as soon as they start to take root in your mind. Negative thoughts have a tendency to feed into themselves and grow louder. Reject them as soon as they come in order to prevent them from ruminating and worsening to the point where it affects you socially. 

Instead, try to be present. Focus on the conversation or whatever activity you're doing. Others will engage with you more when you are present. And it doesn't mean you have to speak. Some people enjoy speaking more than others, some people enjoy listening more. Either way, withdrawing will surely work against you.

I'd also consider finding a source to confide in. A journal if nothing else, but I'd recommend seeking out someone from your friend group who you trust and with whom you can talk about your feelings. Parents, teachers, and guidance counselors can be great adult resources too. 

Keep us updated! Sending positive vibes!"
soc_677817,socialskills,reddit_comment,153,"Like some others said, show real interest in the person u are talking to. People love to talk about themselves. I found out about this in the book ‘How to win friends and influence people’ by Dale Carnegie. Carnegie talks about a time when he met this man. For the whole evening Dale let this man talk about himself and just showed sincere interest in the conversation. Later Carnegie found out from his friend that this man called Carnegie a very interesting person, although Dale didn’t talk much of himself at all. All he did was show real interest in his chatting partner. I’m using this simple trick literally every time and it just makes people open up to you and make the conversations interesting. Hope this helps you! P.S. I used to be EXACTLY like you, hence I took time to write this out (which I have never done in this sub)"
soc_1744578,socialskills,reddit_comment,440,"I will say, I’ve tried that route. What I’m about to say may not be your experience but it is mine. The only thing you may be missing out on is intensive unsatisfiable cravings, shallow friends who use you for your stuff, a lot of days and nights without memory and a damper on your record.
Because of my past stupidity trying that stuff out, there’s a lot of jobs I’m not eligible for, a lot of opportunities I’ve lost, a lot of real friends who’ve left me because they couldn’t stand by my choices, and years of making amends for the harms I did down that path.
I used to be lonely, struggled with social skills and didn’t have friends, and now I’m lonely, struggle with social skills, don’t have many friends, I have intense anxiety attacks, brain damage, trouble with memory, and I live in fear of my past. 
It’s been around 5 years, I’ve been living clean, things have gotten a lot better and I’m grateful I stopped before things got much much worse, but I regret making the choice to try any of those things you mentioned every day.
Again, your experience may be different, but as someone on the spectrum who struggles with social skills, I’ve been hurt more by drugs and alcohol than it ever helped me, and they didn’t help much (if at all).
Alcohol and drugs were a social lubricant, but after a few too many I couldn’t control what I said or did as much as I could sober, and I’m super grateful I don’t drink or do drugs today and haven’t for a while. I sincerely wish I never did at all. I can’t change the past but if reading this prevents you the issues I’ve faced going down that path, and you make it to be older without having touched drugs or alcohol, and you have a clean record, no major regrets from blackouts, and your future is a lot brighter than mine, maybe what I’ve said here will mean something.
I’m 24 now and I started when I was just a little younger than your age, my personal opinion is it isn’t worth the trouble it brings. I currently have to submit character and fitness addendums for my employment and having that dark blip in my past has cost me a lot. 
So I guess my answer is: it depends on the person, but if you make it through (at least early adulthood) without having a past which involves drugs or alcohol, you’d be so much further ahead than some of the people I know who’ve done them."
soc_232923,socialskills,reddit_comment,712,"&gt;I don't want to sit here and be miserable, but how would you imagine you feel if everyone wants to tell you that what you are, what you have done and what you got from it simply isn't true, just because it doesn't fit in their view?

It is *objectively* impossible that an otherwise healthy human being is so different from all others that it's incapable of finding a partner and raising a family. It is *objectively* projection if I meet 100 people from group X, always do the same things and then decide the fact that they don't like me is because of some core characteristic of ""myself"" and not my behavior.

If I walk up to 100 Mexican guys and punch them in the face and always get beat up then the conclusion shouldn't be that Mexicans suck or that I just can't deal with Mexicans. I should be that maybe I shouldn't walk up to them and punch them. Approaching women is exactly the same, people get bad results because they do stupid shit - they're just not aware of all the stupid shit they do. Instead they'd rather decide that women are stupid or that they themselves are stupid.

&gt;So should I start over again, get more rejections, get hurt from more people? Do you want to stand there and watch while I do that and feel more and more shitty about myself?

Sure, why not? There is no success without failure. There's no gain without pain. I know you lift bro.

&gt;I didn't build that cage, deciding to change things won't change the fact that I am not a person who wants to give up on who he is. Would you want to do that about yourself? I don't think so.

Yes, all the time. I used to be a person who is afraid of spiders, I worked on giving that up. I used to be a person who ate meat on a daily basis, I was convinced by arguments and am a vegetarian now. I used to be a person who ""sucks at sports"" for 20 years, decided to fuck it and try some out for a month and it suddenly was enjoyable once I found an awesome group. 

All of this would have been impossible if I decided that I'm spiderscared, meateating, sportsucking and incapable of being attractive. It took me a day to stop eating meat, a year (20h per week) to not feel shit at sports and I'd say about three years of going out 2-3 times a week and meeting women that I started to believe that I could genuinely be attractive. In retrospect, I'm glad I did these things but I felt pretty shit about all of them for a while.

I used to believe that to have success with women I have to make sure they know how much I appreciate them as soon as possible and be genuinely nice to them at all times. I was confident that everyone who doesn't do that is just an asshole, I even believed for a bit that women in general suck or that I'm just not made for that stuff.

Turns out I had to actively work on improving that area of my life just like any other and it ended up changing the person I am into someone who is happier, more competent and makes the people around him happier. I met hundreds of awesome people, even more not-so-awesome people and among all of those a few handful of candidates I wanted to spend more time with and among all of those one that turned into the relationship I wanted from all that work.

That's just how life works. You are both none of the things you do and all of them and you either try new mindsets and behaviors here and there or you sit in he corner eating sand while others learn how to build castles with the same tools at their disposal.

You've got the same tools, get to work or move on. Every single action you ever took (or didn't) was your own personal choice. Your responsibility. All those choices lead to the point at which your life is now. Don't like it? Swap it up."
soc_701064,socialskills,reddit_comment,257,"Well I know that the Lord isn't tormenting you. You're dealt your hand and how you deal with it and your choices in life is up to you. God is not a puppet master pulling your strings. He simply gave you life which you are supposed to live the way you'd like. Choices. Everyone has choices. Based upon those choices your life will be lived the way you've chosen. God simply just wants you to chose him. Life over death. Him over the devil. Good over bad. It's all a choice. Sometimes bad things happen in life. It doesn't mean God has done it. For example a child gets cancer. Something's happen in life for which God is not to blame, most of the time it is the devil we are to blame because he daily tries to make us miserable. he wants us to blame God for all the bad things in life but it's it's not God it's him. But if you are going through something bad in life God is always with you , you can pray to him, if he chooses to intervene, he can, miracles happen everyday , only thing you can do is have faith and believe and pray because even though there's  a lot of bad things going in life, people feel like they've been handed a bad hand  at the end of the day when you die if you believe in Christ you will go to heaven and you won't have to worry about all these earthly things anymore."

If she approaches you again it means she’s attracted to you (doesnt have to be sexual) know that,use it to your advantage so you don’t feel so desperate to talk to her and lose your mind. 

You need to find who you are and what you’re worth before worrying about having friend’s girlfriend etc. if I were you career/education, physical fitness, and hobbies would be my priority. Everything else will come in time...

Think about a business that wants to flourish but doesn't want partnerships, negotiations, attention will that business ever become successful? We live in an ecosystem that revolves around people. I believe that's a good thing, we need people around us because (it's cliche I know) we are social beings. We cannot survive being alone. Take the pandemic for example, a lot of people felt depressed, lonely and stressed out.

I found a few good friends by talking during class, I think it makes people more comfortable to open up to you and remember you are there.

One of my best friends was a french foreign exchange student who knew absolutely no one. After she heard me talking about an assignment with the teacher, she asked me to explain it to her, and then I asked if she had someone to sit with at lunch. We sat together and ended up being really close all year. 

Just my personal experience, but maybe it will help you too :)"
soc_233669,socialskills,reddit_comment,556,"Two things here:

1. If you don't ask you'll never get her number.

This is obvious but important to point out. It will never get easy to do, you just get used to rejection. If you're hung up and worried about getting a no just remember that people are attracted to what they are and it's nothing against you if you're not her type. It feels personal when it happens but it's not. Think about any times it may have been obvious a girl liked you that you weren't into. Sucked for her too. But that's life. You find people who like you and you go for it.

2. Just walking up to her and asking for her number really makes it a low chance you'll get it.

Don't ask for permission to talk to her either (if a girl walked up to you and asked if she could talk to you and then later asked for your number you will probably be less likely to be interested enough to give it to her). Just talk to her like you always do, and if you never have them it's a good opportunity to get to know her. Use *that* as a chance to decide she is right for you. Never forget that she may be knockout gorgeous but if she's bland or insufferable she's not worth the effort. 

If you're getting along well then you've got you're chance. The easiest thing to do if you've never used any charm on a girl to get her number is to suddenly come up with a reason you have to end the conversation (not lie, but maybe your friends are on the other side of the room) and just say ""hey, this has been nice. Tell you what...I've got to get back to my friends over there, but it would be cool to talk again soon. What's your number?""

Me....I'm a no fucks given kind of guy. I much more enjoy to give my number and just forget about everything. You have to be able to not think about whether they're going to call you though. Chances are low they will but if they do then you're golden. But my personality is such I don't want to waste time with a girl that that gives me her number to be polite but then shows no interest then ghosts on me.

You can also do a follow-up of you feel you're really getting along but you get an excuse:

You: Ayyy baby I get yo digits?

Her: sorry but I have a bf teehee.

You: (have something to write with and on ready) No worries. But on the off chance you're just saying that or maybe things don't work out. Here's mine.


It's all calculated risks. If you're new to this and aren't good at reading body language or how she's feeling about you keep it simple and just ask. You'll probably get a no and that's ok. If you're good enough and just nervous with this particular girl then read how she's feeling and know that maybe you shouldn't even bother because she's not showing interest that way. Plenty of beautiful women out there to not have to force yourself into a situation where you don't have the same interests or get along.

Just keep on keepin on brother."
soc_320547,socialskills,reddit_comment,330,"Don't listen to this advice..as a girl, if you walked up to any guy you felt a small stranger-connection with, he would most likely be very open to a conversation. Society today has made it so us men feel like predators. They make us take sexual harassment courses in college as a pre req and the stigma that every guy just wants to talk to you to get laid. This makes many men afraid of walking up to you because we don't know how you might react and we don't want to be publicly embarrassed. 

Now I am not saying that's 100% the case every time. But if a cute girl walked up near me and kinda hinted at being open to a chat by smirking or something..that makes it so much easier for us to initiate. Doing nothing is the WORST thing anyone who wants to find someone to connect with could do. That shit only works for really beautiful women. Not saying you aren't attractive, but the really beautiful girls literally don't need to do anything but be somewhere in public to be picked up. For something more long term, most guys would prefer an average girl over a model chick any day. The egos and self entitlement are not worth their blank personality good looks. 


Putting yourself out there whether its Tinder, going out alone, or dating sites, and being proactive is the best approach. You never know what a simple ""hello"" might turn into. How many times have you wished you said something to someone you saw or wished they might have said something to you? We all have plenty of those times. I bet you a very large percentage would not have thought it was weird at all.

Dating and finding someone is hard. Maxing your looks is important, along with having some short term/long term goals to look forward to. But yea, doing nothing is the worst thing you can do. Don't do that.

Then I ask them honest questions and implications of their views, which is enjoyable for them and/or reveals funny pitfalls in what they think. I mean... it's only douchey to do if you talk about it like I am right now, right? Haha.

Better yet, just take my advice and let people have their point of view and find something you can relate with, so you can have a pleasant interaction. I always make it a point to find something I admire about each new person I meet, and I use it to remember them. I compliment people on their style/hair, or just mention something I've been really into lately (I have lots of hobbies). I even do it with people I don't particularly like. Literally no one can be my enemy because I treat every one like their my best friend!

The classic example is a woman saying ""Gosh, I'm so fat!"" 

So... now I have to make a comment about your body? That's pretty much demanding that I make a perfect, tactful response or you'll get angry.

Like you say, this is for ""new social settings"" - among friends you can relax more.

I would say that one exception is that I like it when people admit they have gaps in their knowledge. Arrogant people never do that because they want you to think they know everything about everything. So, if I met someone, was talking and they said ""Oh, I know nothing about that. I really should read a book sometime!"" I would warm to that person.

I also like it when a person is able to make fun of the country they come from. Most people are too prideful to do that. If I met someone and they said something like ""Jokes? No, I'm from Germany, we don't do that."" I would be impressed. 

(worth noting, in that first instance I would assume that person did actually read books and had wide knowledge; in the second instance I would assume that person had a really great sense of humour!)

So, I think for small things that don't really matter self deprecating humour can be good for creating a good impression with someone. But for important things like body image, mental health, yes I agree. Best avoided."

However, if you want to make new friends, this could be an issue  - the fact that you had to ask this question means that you already know that people have been conditioned to believe that clubbing is a group activity (for some reason) and will assume that if you are out by yourself, it means you don't have any friends. It's also a risk that if they judge you not to have any friends, they may be less willing to engage with you (assuming we are talking about a nightclub.

People in America smile, people in Soviet Blocs don't - they think it's fake and slimy. I could go on.

First of all, I would recommend finding a structured way to meet people like joining a club or getting involved in some sort of program or group on your campus. I can’t give exact examples because it depends on your interests and what’s offered at your school. But meeting people over a shared hobby or interest is a great way to break the ice and bond with people. If your school is even mid-sized, there will be lots of options. I see you can’t work, but volunteering on campus is also a really good way to meet people with like-minded interests. I consider myself a shy but decently social person and I would feel very uncomfortable trying to approach people cold at a party, having a reason to interact and get to know one another is a lot easier.

It appears off this short post that you're identity is easily challenged by anyone you encounter. This usually results in major over corrections in public and could be a source of your awkwardness.

Based on your post history you're also pretty deep into programming - obviously this isn't a problem but the stigma with girls in tech is they are a combination of socially masculine and socially feminine traits but do neither well. 

Programmers at large also tend to shy away from socialization which obviously means that nearly every event they go to, they are going without the express intent to practice socializing.

&gt;Idk, I'm too embarrassed to talk to my friends about this

Finally, while everyone is entitled to their feelings, allowing them to alter your behavior is a recipe for dissatisfaction in life. Consistently allowing embarrassment to control your behavior socially will also further damage your ability to socialize if you are not actively practicing the skill."

In my opinion the former would work.

If one of those guys are interested in you, he’ll definitely try to go up to you after class to talk more, and you both can take it from there if you like him back.

soc_744663,socialskills,reddit_comment,242,"I'd think so. The only guys that have flirted with me were largely lacking in social polish, so I don't have a good receiving-end reference point on that one. haha. 

See girls tell me that guys are usually easy to tell, but in my experience it's usually easy to tell for girls — I think it depends on the person more than the gender, how much they've tried to hide it, and how much practice they have at hiding such things, but the tells will be similar. Girls will be more physically expressive, guys will be more assertive (to the girl, but also to all of life) around someone they like (if they're not just so shy and scared they disappear into a corner, but I don't know that type well). 

For me the tells that I like someone are that I start sharing with them random meaningless stuff about my life, and texting them somewhat relentlessly (such that at the times they're likely to be free, they have a text waiting from me). Basically I match myself to their daily rhythms so the communication seems effortless and natural, but it's on their schedule. That's something I do. 

In person, definitely eye contact, a bit more teasing, I get this flirty eye, I look at them a lot more, especially to see how they react to something I or someone else said (that's a tell for either gender for sure I think..)."

I'm not going to tell you if you should continue being friends.  I don't know anything about you or your other friendships.  You have to decide if that is a person you don't mind keeping in your life.  Is this person convenient for you for the most part too? Would you be ok knowing your friendship will never progress and that it'll most likely fizzle out?
I would recommend dropping and/all expectations you have for people like this."
soc_1200563,socialskills,reddit_comment,258,"Firstly, I'd like to say that meek is the one, that can keep his will, his strenght, under pressure. it means to be able to do but choosing not to. So, if you consider yourself meek you should be happy, as it defines you as being patient and powerful. Don't haste to be foolish in your actions. For if you would have been raised differently, you'd be missing out on different things in life. Manners are hard to keep and easy to loose. If you feel like you are unheard, or have trouble speaking your mind, I'd suggest keeping your character intact, instead of acting out of the ordinary, take pride in yourself and make your manners uplift your charisma. Being well mannered is not a trait, it is a mastery. Truthfully, if you've got problems with being too quiet, when you feel like speaking. Or you are too timid in opportunities of courage, the problems lies not in your manners, but in your devotion to speak and act for yourself. The first, easiest, and yet most important thing to fix this problem, is to be able to accept the way you've dealt with such situations in the past. You must understand, that is was not your manners that kept you from talking,   it was just your decision, not to talk, yet. It is, however up to you and you only if what you wanted to say, is worthy of saying. Even then, Silence is a powerful tool.
Hopefully you will find the answers you desire. Good luck."
soc_746767,socialskills,reddit_comment,247,"Having a deep conversation is about being vulnerable. And in order to have one YOU have to be willing to make yourself vulnerable and the other person has to be willing to be vulnerable with you too. So you can do everything right in q conversation. You may even think that the person you're talking to likes you and has warned up to you which might totally be true BUT it all comes down to whether they feel they can be vulnerable with you so if it doesnt work dont beat yourself up.

Quick tips:

-take a chance. You might think the person you're talkin to might judge you for admitting that you cried during toy story 3 but they also might find the fact endearing and may feel comfortable enough to tell you that they still cry everytime they see titanic. You'd be surprised.

-dont get TOO heavy too quick. Might not want to bring up serious stories of abuse or death right away.

-make sure the topic goes with conversation otherwise its gonna sound like youre just trying to vent to someone rather than relate to them.

-if the other person does not reciprocate then do not pry. Idk about other people but there isn't a quicker way to get me to completely shut myself to you than if you're trying TOO HARD to get personal info out of me. I will suspect you may be trying to take advantage of me.

Hope this helps!"
soc_124088,socialskills,reddit_comment,487,"I know how you feel because what you're going through, I went through a few years back. Now I'd love to give you advice on how to improve your situation but that would be ironic because my story doesn't have a happy ending.

 Growing up I had always been a shy introverted kid however it wasnt bad enough to affect my social life. I had friends like any other teenager and enjoyed going out with them every now and then, life was good. My problems began sometime after starting high school, or maybe earlier I must have been around 15. For some reason I became anxious about social interaction. I had always been the shy type of kid but this was different, I started to feel self conscious about my self and unconfortable around other people specially in out public places. Just like you I hated having to go to any social gatherings and if i ever did it gave me headaches and made me tired. Whenever my friends invited me out or to a party, i made up excuses so didn't have to go and even started to avoid and ignore them, after some time they figured i wasnt worth their time and stopped talking to me altogether. Family reunions werent any different i panicked whenever i had to attend one so just like i did with my friends I stopped going out to family events like weddings, birthdays, thanksgiving reunions etc. My parents always triend to make me go and we often argued but all their efforts were always futile. Without realising it i slowly was becoming a bitter outcast with no social life and devolved social skills. I spent so much time alone that it stunt my development. It wasn't until I graduated high school that reality hit me, i realised how much I had changed and how lost I was not knowing what I was going to do with my life which kind of messed with my head even more. I remember sitting at night scrolling through my facebook feed on my phone and seeing all these videos and photos of people looking so happy it made me feel sorry about myself. I couldn't believe I had wasted so many years of my life doing absolutely nothing productive for myself or the people around me and instead had turned into an inept son of a gun.

Like I said I can't tell you what to do to improve your situation because everyone is different and I handled mine horribly. However I can tell what NOT to do, you dont want to isolate yourself from yourfriends and those who love you, talk to someone if you havent already done so Im sure someone will help you. I know Social Anxiety, she's a bitch but dont run away from it or else it will beat you down and keep you down if you let it.

You might be seen as the “teachers pet”. I wouldn’t suggest changing ur personality, and it’s good that you don’t want to do that. What I do suggest is trying to be more of a “listener”. What I mean by that is basically being a less active participant in conversation, to give a person time to warm up to you and get to know you. Try to find a person who either likes arguing, which is always a fun time, or someone who will consider what you think thoughtfully"

I don't have many friends and I like it this way. It takes me enough effort to keep contact with my 4 dear friends (they also reach out to me and I feel they're great people).


I still get that lonely feeling sometimes and I may get depressed for no apparent reason but overall, I like it this way.


This gives me plenty of time to improve myself in areas I'd like, not give a fuck about others expectations (I'm still not there yet), and enough time to think and reflect alone. Call me crazy, but I find that's more important than conversations and parties.


I say you need to learn to be alone but not lonely (corny but catchy phrase)  and reflect on your feelings and why your feeling them. Then take action in a way you'd like and not just because of peer pressure.

soc_647325,socialskills,reddit_comment,191,"Yeah i think she has some growing up to do and needs to learn some strategies for her bpd. It's not up to you to protect her feelings or not trigger her. Plenty of people with bpd are not toxic, so you have no reason to stay friends if you're not having it. A lot of young adult relationships are toxic because of lack of experience of diverse people, problems and communication skills. They're probably still adjusting to the adulthood and you realized that the relationship was toxic before them.

Don't let this one bad friend create the idea that everyone with a mental illness is allowed to be toxic because they are going through shit, call them out on their wrong doings so they can be a better friend or so they can't use it as an excuse to treat you badly. You have already distanced yourself, so distance your emotions too. 

If they're an adult they have plenty of options to get help, they should put the effort into mending their mistakes or apologizing. No ond can know how things effect you but yourself so you have to communicate."
soc_1269598,socialskills,reddit_comment,244,"I think your approach makes sense but honestly the reality is not as easy and straightforward as you make it seem. We are social species and designed to care what other fellow humans think of us. This is hardwired in us due to evolution. 

I think a better approach is to accept that we actually care what other people think of us, but still acting as we please. So we basically override this ancient desire. 

I mean, let’s be honest here why does it feel good to get a like or upvote? This is just virtual nothingness and yet it feels good if people approve of our comment. 

I think the key is to recognize this desire, but not let it rule our lives. We are still programmed by ancient times when we really needed the group for survival. Nowadays we no longer need the group’s approval as much. This is a cognitive effort to override it though. 

But I really don’t think we can just delete social anxiety just like that. A lot of social anxiety sufferers have tried anything but without success. It’s not that cookie cutter. As others have said, what motivates you to not care? A deep down desire to be liked. So it’s a catch-22. 

In my opinion it’s better to realize that basically every human has still desire and it’s completely normal. But in the end we don’t have to let it control us.

There’s every chance you could just end up being the guy people think is just an asshole, and they’d be “bullying you” because the reality is you bullied first. I’ve known very few people who can insult and still be genuinely funny and get away with it. It relied entirely on their tone and deadpan ability to take away the insult and leave the funny to be funny. If you’re trying to “pull a leg”, you’re literally trying to provoke a reaction.

soc_1431947,socialskills,reddit_comment,239,"At the end of the day unless you’re a well-known public figure (like a football star, celebrity, whatever) most of the time girls are not going to approach you. You’ll have to make the first move.

Start by just talking to them as a normal person, like anybody. Give them a compliment, introduce yourself, ask basic small-talk questions (where are you from?), then to make the conversation more interesting start asking “why” questions (why did you move to X from Y?”). Eventually they will be comfortable opening up to you, and if they show excitement or interest in your conversation, there’s a good chance they’re interested. If you’re in an open space with not a lot of people, keep talking to her and continue with the conversation, flirt a bit, but not a lot. You’re just getting to know them. If you’re in a bar or crowded space, try to keep the conversation shorter and ask for her number, then regroup with your homies. The bar isn’t a great place to get to know someone and if you’re looking for a girlfriend instead of a hookup, if I were you, I’d avoid going home with her the night you meet her.

Take it slow from there, get to know her more, share a kiss, cuddle, and forward….usually a relationship is just that. You’re building something where you know her and she knows you, and that takes time and care"
soc_435397,socialskills,reddit_comment,388,"Ok. Let's look at the toxic situation first. Why would you want to remain with these types of people? Toxics will only drag you down. If this is the case, why do you want to be dragged down? It lowers your self-esteem and self-worth. Is that what you think of yourself? Don't you belive that you deserve better treatment for yourself? You should only be giving of your time to those people in your life that DESERVE it. Our time is valuable. How we use it is our choice. But remember, our choices have consequences. We will talk about that later. Toxic people are users. They will use you to get what they want AND will make you feel like you are trash, just for their own entertainment. So, this creates a cycle of you doing their bidding, HOPING that they will approve of you, but instead, they make you feel UNWORTHY. This causes the cycle to start again - you running for them, hoping for approval, and then being rejected, again. We suggest that you clear these people out of your life as soon as possible. In other words, before you move forward, you have to take out the trash. This is the first step to regain control of yourself. Remove the negative influences from your life. It will give you a sense of freedom. 
How to do this? Stop hanging out with them. Change your phone number. Go cold turkey. Find a new group of people to be around. It may take a bit of time, but you can do it. If you don't think you can, think about which thing holds the most importance for you: 
1. Your boyfriend...........OR....2 Your toxic ""friends"". So, if you could only have 1 or 2, which would you choose? #1 - Love and acceptance of your boyfriend.......OR.........
#2 - Feelings of unworthiness and never being good enough from your toxic friends. We think the decision is a no-brainer.  Remember that your decision has consequences, and will very well affect your life for many years to come. Heavy stuff for sure.
We are going to look at this in ""chunks"" instead of all at once. More to come. Don't worry, you are going to be ok. Just take this advice all in and think about it.

You can speak for yourself when questions about your ""race"" come up. How you respond to the question is up to you. For example you can provide several answers:
My nationality is...
I was brought up in the .... culture(s)
I was born in ...
I consider myself...

I was born in .... and raised in the .... culture. I did my schooling in .... and I now consider myself ...

That gives a better indication of the richness of who you are than any label 🏷  of ""race"".

It is easy to detach your emotions from it, and rationally think that it would be easy go peacefully through life without dealing with any trouble from relationships.

My suggestion to you is bring up your interests to your coworkers or those new nice people you've met, if you haven't yet. A simple ""There's a game I enjoy playing"" or ""Have you ever seen this movie? It's kind of unknown, but you should give it a watch, I really enjoy it."" or ""Oh, this is one of my favorite songs.""

At work, I was rather quiet unless talked to, but one of my coworkers I overheard one day talking about an anime I've seen. So I brought that up because I was a fan of it. After getting to know him better, I found we do like similar shows, and share an interest in various video games. We've since been talking about various manga we've read or anime we've seen as recommendations for new things. Same goes with games.

The thing is, you have to decide to stick your neck out initially. You may end up surprised at who shares similar interest with you. Some of them will be thrilled to experience an unknown and they may offer you a new experience to try as well.

soc_352441,socialskills,reddit_comment,393,"  Well first off, they are kind of right to some extent. Don't lie about things and try to make yourself seem cooler that what you really are. That is a big turn off for most people once they pick up on it. Just be yourself and talk about the things you like. If they agree then cool, if not oh well. 

   As for them being your friends, I don't know really. It does sound like they are trying to pull themselves away, which if that's the case then, I'd say let them. If someone doesn't want to be your friend then there is really no use in forcing them. Just let them do what they want. If you want to make things less awkward between you and Y then just do what he wanted, keep your distance. If you seem thought don't act like he doesn't exists. Maybe a friendly jester or smile and carry on with your day, if he tries to start a conversation then that's fine, that's on him. 

   If you really want to join Rush then by all means go right on a head. Send a message to the guys who are running it telling how you want to join. Its not that big of a deal really, and if anything it shows that you are interested in making new friends and having a fun time so they will probably warm up to you pretty fast. 

   But again, just don't lie about yourself to impress them. You should never have to lie in order to get peoples your friends. It should just come naturally. Like what you want to like and people with similar interest will come. 

  As for over coming loneliness, there a tone of ways, you'll just have to figure out a way that works for you. Maybe join some clubs and meet new people, join forms and talk to people online. Maybe play some video games, whether or not they are single player  doesn't really matter. If they are fun you'll have fun, plus it gives you something to talk about with other people. Just find hobbies and things you mite find fun or interesting. Chances are there is someone out there that likes the something as you. So don't sweat it, just be yourself and do what you want.

And about getting validation from guys, It’s very true I actually noticed that whenever random men talk to some my friends they feel so confident, meanwhile whenever I talk to men I just feel normal/ like it dosn t increase my ego/ confidence. It used to happen to me tho when I was a teenager because it was something new lol.
Point is I have to admit that these kind of people trigger in me a sense of jelousy, because even if I see myself more accomplished/ better looking or something like that, I feel jelous because I don t understand this level of confidence coming only from the inside and nothing else and I don t know how to work on myself with this.

You are insecure and that’s fine. You’ve been beaten down and that’s fine. 

Now get up. 

Because what are you going to do about it? You said you’ve seen a therapist but what else have you done about it? How else have you tried to help yourself? Are you trying to reach a goal or are you more concerned about progress because the latter is the only to reach the goal and too many people overlook that. 

You need to work on self acceptance. Prioritizing your emotional well-being and also going out of your way to cultivate the skills you actually want. Be uncomfortable. Look inward and stop lookin around for other people to decide for your if you are “normal”- “acceptable” because I’ll tell you right now, most people don’t give a shit. And I say that as a good thing. You gotta learn to not give a shit, live in hour own truth and you’ll start to find the crowd that resonates with you. But that can only come from embracing oneself. 

FYI- Social Media doesn’t count for anything whatsoever, it’s a place where people showcase the best of themselves but you never get to see the cracks in their masks BUT THE CRACKS ARE THERE. 

Yes, there are issues and systems in society set up for certain groups and demographics to fail. It’s just the fact. But I think you should first focus on thriving in your own circle, thriving inwardly so you can do so on the outside as well and other doors will start to open. Self improvement is the greatest investment any of us can make even if it’s risky, if it’s messy or even if it seems like the road less traveled by a loner.

soc_1057372,socialskills,reddit_comment,446,"The unfortunate reality is that you're going to have to keep coming out of the closet and deal with transphobia for the rest of your life if you choose to transition. You didn't choose to be transgender, but you did choose to transition, likely because you feel like it's going to improve your quality of life. The unfortunate consequence is that you're going to have to deal with people having all sorts of opinions about your choices, regardless of whether that's fair or necessary. That's not your fault, but you're going to have to face all of that anyway for the rest of your life. There's no way you could change that either. It sucks, I get it.

People who are close to you are going to find out you're transgender; some people will be able to clock you, unless you're extremely lucky and already have some of the physical traits that look like those of the opposite sex. You're going to be judged for being different, because you're an extreme minority. Again, you couldn't possibly help that, but there's nothing to be gained from sugar-coating the truth. You're going to be misunderstood and disrespected regardless, so what you must do is to also transition a thicker skin early on. Your choices are yours and you shouldn't care whether they please anyone else but you. Somewhere, someone is upset because you make different lifestyle choices than them. I genuinely hope that realization makes you feel a bit better. You're not alone struggling with these issues. They're pretty common actually.

If you're not happy with whom you are, you're not going to make others happy with whom you are. Nobody likes a depressed, clingy, desperate friend who needs constant support and attention; stability and independence, however, are extremely attractive, as is confidence. Your attitude needs a transition as well, although I do understand that hormone therapy may probably also have a negative effect on your mental health. You can get hobbies, interests and most people are about as interesting as watching paint dry, but not undeserving of love. You need to internalize your locus of control and start focusing on what else you can change about yourself to feel better overall. 

You're more than just transgender, though, and I want you to find out what that is, what qualities you have and what your passions are. If you're going to fight for your own happiness, you might as well go the extra mile. It's up to you to make plans and efforts and to figure out who your friends are; in that respect, you're no different from anyone else and your struggles are shared and widely understood."

People with autism tend to take things more literally, sometimes it's harder to gauge in social situations. Most neurotypical people don't put hard boundaries on friendships, or they're not directly thinking about it. So when you directly tell them they've kinda downgraded in your social hierarchy, they probably got offended because A) they're not used to hearing that, and B) they probably have different ideas of different meanings friendships to themselves. 

I applauded you for being direct. When the opportunity came up, you told them how you felt. If that's not the kinda relationship you want, then you have the right to look elsewhere. But sometimes you don't have to put people into boxes/categories; most people just want to have a good time. So if you can relish that, then you can feel more carefree with anybody. Unlike romantic relationships, where things tend to be more defined because you set those boundaries with your partner, often we're not explicitly setting boundaries/rules with our friends. Regardless, if someone breaks a deal, then you're usually in the right to be mad. It's up to you to decide how to move forward with that."

Personally I love PDA. I want everyone to know that my girl is mine, and I’m hers. Whenever I see couples being cute or affectionate with each other I always think “damn. I want that so bad”. Never once have I thought “ew get a room you two”. 

When I was with my last gf I specifically remember a time we were at a theme park and there were couples here and there that were being super affectionate and clearly had desire for each other. When I couldn’t get that from my gf, it tore me up. One of the many issues that eventually lead to our separation.

In her case, we weren’t on the same level emotionally or sexually so that ultimately killed our relationship. But with you, you two are married so unless anything’s changed, I don’t know why it would be a problem. Neither of you should invalidate your own or the other person’s feelings either but I think you should have a proper conversation about the matter. 

If the man is missing this strong desire from you and yet he’s giving it to you, he probably just feels he’s not getting a return on investment. So if that’s the case talk about why. What are the things that have caused this change and how can those be worked on together? Many men get demonized essentially for having strong attraction to our partners and I think that’s just as sick as women getting labeled “prudes” for not being all over their partner. 

It’s important to remember that neither of you are in the wrong here. You’re just looking at this from vastly different perspectives and as such, I encourage you to intentionally discuss them in order to find why they’re so different, and how you can come together for a resolution/compromise.

There’s a saying that goes “Men marry women expecting them to never change, and women marry men expecting them to change”

Maybe he just wants to feel like how it was before and there’s nothing wrong with that. Just talk about it together and see what happens. And don’t let what “normal relationships” are like hold you back either. Strive to be better than those. If you want him and/or want to express your love emotionally, physically, etc. do it. No matter where you are or who you’re with. Don’t let the views of others prevent you from living life on your terms and you as well as your husband giving each other the love that you deserve in the ways you deserve it. 

You may want to have a conversation about your love languages as well. 

Hope this helps. Best of luck to both of you.

soc_1141592,socialskills,reddit_comment,271,"There is no reason to be socially anxious. People are people, OK? You're gonna be fine. Trust me. Everyone is different because they had different upbringings, so just be you. Let your personality flow. Don't try to get people to like you. Be natural. 

Flow in the conversations. Some people will like you and some will not. Don't take it personally. Just because someone will not want to spend time with you doesn't mean there is a problem with you. NEVER take it personal. 

My best advice is to be a good listener. Start a subject and ask questions that provoke others to talk, so you don't have to. Start a fire in the conversation and keep it burning with simple questions, but be genuine about it. Immerse yourself in their story. Every one is different, so learn to adapt individually to each person. 

You'll learn more by listening to others than by talking to them. Speak with adults, too. You'll learn a lot of skills. When I was your age, I spoke to old people a lot. Heard their stories. It made me mature quicker. Old people need ears to hear their stories. Be those ears. Seek always fruitful conversations.

 Don't waste time on talking about things that will not make you grow as a person. Sure, talk to people at school and be your age, and chat about fun stuff, but keep in mind time will pass very fast, so use it wisely. You'll find out that small talk will leave you feeling emotionally drained, but listening to older people will leave you feeling enriched and full of purpose."
soc_1113713,socialskills,reddit_comment,129,"Yes. lol. To all of it.

Warmth is absolutely something that many people are born with or at least learn as pat in their formative years. And like any other inherent trait or natural talent, it can absolutely be intentionally learned as a developed skill as well. And you may very well in fact at least sometimes during the period of working on adopting that characteristic come off as a lizard alien trying to blend in as a human until you find your sweet spot.

If its important to you, then its still worth it. If its not worth that risk and awkwardness and discomfort of trial and error to you, that's totally fine to; plenty of super cool people who happen to be fairly stoic.

Entirely your call."
soc_1134471,socialskills,reddit_comment,199,"Yes, I know what you're talking about. I was in that situation too.

Maybe you could try asking other boys about sport events from last night (NBA, NFL, etc.).

Another easy way is just to follow the news. Follow new measures for the virus, have your own opinion on vaccines and so on.

But probably the best topic you can talk about are your hobbies. I don't really know your zone of interest. Doing something that you love doing and being good at it surely boosts your confidence. It definitely worked for me. In that way you're going to be uniqe to everybody. It could be anything: playing instruments, martial arts, painting, etc. For example, I love playing guitar and everyone asks me about that because they know that I play guitar. However, don't force doing hobbies that you don't like.

But at the end of the day, there is a lot of variables that only you know. So please don't take advice as ""professional"". I'm only 19 so I'm not professional in anything really, especially not in giving advice to someone. If you want to talk in greater detail about this issue I'm here to try to help."
soc_1367026,socialskills,reddit_comment,211,"I relooked at your previous posts.  Perhaps edgelord may have been a little bit of an exaggeration, though, there's still some posts that'll raise eyebrows.  Could probably merge 2 and 3 into just use your filter liberally. Think before you speak kind of thing.  Ask yourself ""Could I go without saying this?""  There's more to it than just suppression of bad thought but production of good.

On the admitting your wrong thing, it's not so much fear rather than stubbornness and pride.  They can be very subtle and can prevent you from seeing something else.  It helps to pinpoint roadblocks and how to overcome them.

That being said, in response to another post of yours about posting hi in discord and getting crappy remarks.  It's really important to not surround yourself with people like that.  It's like a frog and boiling pot situation.  It can be hard to leave a community/people that you've became fond of but the people in your life will affect your life and it is entirely up to you as to who is in it... you also may want to revise your discord profile and/or consider prior conversations in that discord.

soc_1682727,socialskills,reddit_comment,183,"This thread! 
1) She may or may not like you, but is interested enough to meet you. It simply means she’s interest and willing to take a chance to meet you. Don’t read too much into this.

2) She wants to know up front if you are okay with tall women. This is probably because of some past history.

By all means tell her what you think. 

1) If you’re not interested, let her know. How to deliver the message is up to you. But if you are trying for a NTA response, make sure it’s clear that you appreciate her being up front about it, and compliment her (if you want) but let her know it’s your personal preference and probably for the best.

2) If you are interested — DO NOT MAKE JOKES ABOUT HER HEIGHT. Unless you are trying to gamble on her having a sense of humor. Lots and lots of downside. If you want to make a joke, self direct it. Like, I have elephant ears.. want to meet up? Or just be plain and ask her out."

Remember THEIR name.

Say someone came up to you, and was all like, ""hey bob, how's it going?"" Say this person isn't a friend, just someone you've seen in class / at work / etc. You know what you are going to INSTINCTIVELY do? Ask yourself, ""gee, what is that guy's name?"". You will feel pressured to do this, because, after all, he knows YOUR name. Then you are going to do something like, ask someone else what his name is, or try real hard to remember his name next time it comes up.

A little devious but it works super-well."
soc_356656,socialskills,reddit_comment,800,"Hi OP. I'm around your age with similar interests/disinterests. You need to think about how you can ever expect someone else to love you if you can't even love yourself. Women are people, just like you, with the same fears and wants and dreams, but they're not walking around asking how they can make somebody else complete. I know love is often presented to us like that (he was a drug addict until he met HER, he was kind of a shithead but SHE changed him) but women, like men, just want to have supportive relationships. They don't want to be under pressure to be a cure for your depression. 

Imagine the kind of person you want to be in a relationship with—maybe she's supportive, confident, has big dreams that she works hard towards—and that's the kind of person you need to strive to be, because that's the kind of person that she wants to be with. It's not impossible to become those things, it just takes work, time, and patience. You have to work on yourself.

A lot of people have given you good advice for working on your anxiety, so I won't address that—I'm going to focus on the ""working on yourself"" part. 

* It's good you have some interests, focus on feeding those, and trying something new. If you have a tight budget you can search for ""free hobbies"" and ""free skills""; I've seen a few popular posts like that. You could volunteer and find meaning in giving back to your community. The goal is to enjoy spending time alone, and to find communities of people with similar interests, if you are a social person.
* Go to the gym a few times a week and build up a routine. Everyone is different but personally I would recommend Stronglifts 5x5, there's a free guide and app if you google it. I have found continuously going to the gym helps my anxiety, and has helped me build confidence in myself. It's also helped me love myself, at a very basic level—sure I don't look like a model, but I know exactly how strong and capable my body is. It's also a good place for me to compete against myself, and to have solid evidence of progress.
* I would STRONGLY encourage you to take a break from dating sites/apps while you take time to focus on yourself. In your current state, you are most likely giving off really strong desperation vibes, and run the risk of attracting someone who is interested in you for the wrong reasons. Give yourself some amount of time—I think 6 months would be a good start—where you aren't allowed to use them, and you focus only on yourself. 
* AFTER you have worked on yourself and you return to these places with confidence and love for yourself, you should think about why and how you are messaging these women. They likely get about a million ""hey how are you"" messages just like yours, and have to try and guess as to who is a genuinely good person they might click with, who is a weird creep, or worse, someone who could hurt them. Make it easier for them. Read their profiles, reach out to people that you are interested in for some reason other than just that they're attractive, and show that in your message. ""Hey, I noticed you like nature—have you been on any good hikes lately?"" Your intent should be to meet someone that you get along with and want to spend more time with, nothing more. If you click, suggest meeting up in public places for casual dates. Be aware that women are often fearful of saying no because they have no way of knowing how you might react—will you swear at them, stalk them? Take rejection in stride, politely, and recognize some ""soft"" forms of rejection (like dodging the question) and leave them alone. 


Finally, you need to deal with this:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm terrified, I'm severely depressed, as I'm writing this I'm crying, I feel like I've failed at life, everyone I know my age has had girlfriends or is with a long term partner.

Romantic love is frankly not the biggest part of life. You've likely already experienced love from friends, family, etc. Focus on what you really want to accomplish with your life—excelling your career? making a difference in the world? treating everyone you meet with care and respect? These are all much, much greater things to do with your life than having a girlfriend. Also, what people your age is doing shouldn't impact your happiness so much. What matters more is the kind of people they are than whether or not they're with someone, and you should hold yourself to that same standard. Good luck."

But you don't want to keep asking questions over and over. Ask a question, then make a comment after their answer before asking another one. For example:

You: Where are you from?
Them: New York.
You: Oh cool. I was born and raised here on the west coast and haven't had a chance to go to New York, but it's on my bucket list. Do you like it here or out there better?

soc_363183,socialskills,reddit_comment,298,"I can't say what would work for you, but for me, I know what works. It was a little bit of different, I don't want to call it abuse, as it wasn't intentional or malicious, I really was (and am) a little over sensitive, but some counseling, some meditation practice, a little Jiu Jitsu (or pick something to get aggression out), some working out, some coding (helps me think logically), painting and drawing and goal setting...... damn. Sounds like a long list when I write it out, but the writing out goals thing is pretty small, and it started with things with (when a friend asks, go out with them. Don't hide at home, online again). The workout stuff turns into routine and you don't start it all at once. Build up. Meditation is easier these days. They make apps, but a class is better. Just to get out of your own head for a minute and relax and come at your own life fresh for once.

Most of all, see a counselor, if you can afford it. That's the problem with therapy. And it might not have to be a forever thing. It might just be a few sessions to get you off tilt, so you can get to where you start taking care of your own deal. Then some check ins, when you need a disinterested party to talk to or someone to give you some steps to get your shit together. They aren't magic, but they can give you some tools to help you manage your issues. =)

soc_449219,socialskills,reddit_comment,327,"This is one of the hardest things about dating to get accustomed to; the lack of feedback. The thing is, 99% of the time there isn't any real feedback that isn't ""I just wasn't feeling it"" or ""there was no spark"". That 1% of the time, when it actually was something you could've done differently (like the way you dressed or that you like comic books or whatever), it doesn't matter anyway because if they actually liked you they wouldn't be put off by that.

Which is not to say that you don't have to change and that everyone should accept you exactly as you are. If you think you're creepy or an asshole, reflect on what behaviors you think make you that way and change them. Self-reflect and/or ask a trusted friend if there's anything about you that you can improve. However, it's up to you and you alone to decide if you need to improve anything about yourself. You have to do it for you, not for other people. And if the person genuinely likes you then they won't have a problem with you as you are.

The other thing you have to understand is that asking for or expecting feedback has the capacity to go wrong. It often comes off as begging, like you're trying to figure out what to change about yourself in order for them to like you. It makes the interaction sound like a negotiation, as though you're bartering for them like they're merchandise. If I do XYZ for you then will you consent to go out with me? That comes off as insecure and pathetic. And it also has the potential to get violent, because if I do XYZ for you then I feel entitled to a date with you, and if you still refuse me then I feel cheated and then I'm going to get angry. You might know that you wouldn't do this, but other people do not."
soc_1385994,socialskills,reddit_comment,1339,"I read this, shit. So here is my story:

 

My mother was abused by my stepfather, whom also abused me and my brother. She finlly left him when I was 12. Since then she gave me almost everything that I wanted. I was spoiled, you could say. Well, spoiled for a lower class child. Mcdonald's almost daily. Food persistently. I never had to work for anything. I had an allowance each weekend. Mostly spent on drugs, booze, cigarettes and alcohol. I spent most of my teenage years out and about each weekend. Riding around, searching for a good time. I never Cared about anything. Not even my own self. I was a terrible student. I had the daily chores and the lawn, but mostly free will.  I do not blame my mother. She had gone through so much that she just wanted to covet her relationship with her children. So, come post grad. I was entered into a JuCo against my wishes. I kept dropping out and using the money to continue to party. I never moved out. Stayed at home. I would have a bunch of different places to stay and only be home a few days a week. But I became a drunkard. I harbored a dream and a passion, and it wasn't college. I finally got to go to art school. After a lot of coercing about wasted money, my family gave in. Anyways, some time passed and I finally got a college education in some bullshit degree. I Stayed at home still. Fast forward a few years and I entered the work force. I worked at the same fast food job for seven years. Worked my way up to manager. I still stayed home. I would help my mother in procuring things and paying bills, but mostly saved for my own benefit. My grandmother became very sickly and bed ridden, and this is when I finally moved out. I moved in with her and so did my family. She needed 24 hour care. So here we all are staying under the same roof again. Eventually she passed. My brother and I were given my grandmothers house in her inheritance and trust. (Probably something I shouldn't reveal but fuck it) With what little change I received from closed bank accounts and selling off assets, I traveled. I never gave a family member anything except grief for leaving. I basically disappeared for a little while. New York, LA, Washington state. Gone. Coming home, my mom never even mentioned my absence. I went back to the fast food job that I loathed and finally took responsibility for everything that was catching up to me nearing thirty. My mother lost her job. Terminated from a place where she had worked for fifteen years for no reason other than she didn't have a college education. My brother had moved out. Got strung out on opioids and started dating a terrible woman who had Bi-polar disorder and addicted to meth. So it was just me and  her. I took over everything. Every bill. It was drenching and I was so frustrated. But my mom used her pension to sustain for a little while. My brother would only pop his head in the door to come and do his laundry and wouldn't even speak to anyone. It took two years for my mother to find steady work. In the meantime, we bought two cars with my checks. New appliances, clothing, food etc.  We survived the storm. Within a few months of her finding a job, I still craved travels. So I told her my intentions this time. Sell everything I owned and take off for a little while. After that, I lost my job. Back to the same squares as before. Within the next few months, she was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. The lady she was working for passed away. I quit menial jobs to take care of my mother and my brother got clean and sober and moved back home. He is still dating the crazy, but that is another story. I have nothing and have had nothing for over a year now. Life subdued to cans of beans because I am so poor I eat 85cent canned beans. My mothers treatments have been once a month for a few months. Now she is falling sicker and needs constant care. Me and my brother could not take care of her every single day given she needed, well, diaper changes and she did not want to subject us to that. So, she moved in with her sister. Adequate housing and care. But, I have to drive across town just to spend time with her, and I can't afford that. I have been unemployed a lot during he pandemic and keep thinking the only time that is important is hers. So I still do not work. This is all a personal choice now. I have been abused by my family for my choices. Diminished to near rubble and dust as a person and I still go over there trying to smile and laugh and make her smile and laugh even though every bank draft is red and every statement is overdue. That is life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's the moral after all that sad and depressive shit: 

It doesn't matter what you are fed or believe your parents provide or didn't provide. I take my own responsibilities and choices into account now. There are people that have much worse stories. Be fortunate for what you have. How did getting spoiled affect me? Well, I am 34 years old: unemployed with a bullshit art diploma and I eat beans out of a can. At some point my life got all out of whack. I don't know where, and I don't care either. I am responsible. Not my mother. There is a time in life that no matter your circumstances, you have to take care of your own actions and responsibilities. I do not blame my mom for a damn thing she did. I wouldn't change it for the world because it turned me into who I am emotionally and mentally. I watch a woman crawl out of bed screaming in pain because of her cancer still trying to fight because she doesn't want to go anywhere and see me succeed in life. She hobbles down the steps and cries to go to her Dr's because I am her world and all that matters. She told the Dr the other day, ""I am not going anywhere, I still have my children to cook for."" Part of this is the mental fog, but that is besides the point. She will always see me as a youngster fighting the world and losing the battle. Which I am perfectly fine with. Because even though, I have failed- SHE FUCKING SUCCEDED IN LOVE. Stop blaming your parents. Yes people have much more eccentric lives and grander things, but if you envy them- go out and achieve them. There is a way. Always a way. I did, with my travels. I still will with my wanderlust. In fact once she is gone, I am not looking back at this place I call home. 

Wish I had a happier ending to it all. Check back with me in a few months and find out what boat or Island I am on from hoping a freighter. Because I will be homeless soon and broke. 

Real moral of the story: No matter what you think you want to do or what your parents tell you to do, get an education and job. It will help you procure a better life. I mean, if I had listened, I would probably be able to take care of her now. Best nurses and Dr's a decent insurance company could provide. Instead, Medicaid and a whole lot of grieve with that.

When I say people should ""think like me"". I don't mean ""they should have the same opinions as me"". I mean. They should be able to identify logical fallacies and think abstractly. And be able to change my mind. To talk about non tangible things. I believe this is integral for the future survival of the human race.

And I stated above I don't think this way of thinking is morally superior. Because it's all subjective anyway. I think that if people thought this way and were able to identify these logical inconsistencies. The world would have much less problems. And therefore to me (and probably others to) be a better place.

soc_1697961,socialskills,reddit_comment,200,"I feel this is not better left unsaid. If he said it at the beginning of the relationship and it is still bothering you, you need to communicate with them more. Do break it down to yourself though, why does it bother you, it doesn't affect your current relationship directly, and they aren't in one now. Be honest about whether there are good reasons why you feel the way you do. Your feelings are valid, but their purpose for existence may be an overreaction, so approach him once you understand that information and have a discussion about what it means for your future. 

Also, think about it like this: Would you be more or less hurt if he hadn't told you until now, or even later after you were married? 

I am a firm believer that communication up front is key to ensure differences in value like past relationships don't get in the way, although I am also of the belief that unless the past relationship directly affects you (still has feelings for ex or ex is still prominently in life in a harmful way), its water under the bridge and shouldn't be given any thought past acknowledging its existence."

I am also a girl. I understand it’s nerve-wracking to have someone staring at you, much less in place where they definitely shouldn’t be. 

All I say is trust your gut. If in retrospect the guy seemed harmless, like he was just spacing out, whatever. You can apologize if you so choose. BUT, if YOU still feel uncomfortable, like something legit felt really off about his actions, regardless of what the guy was actually doing, forget about it. You made your decision in the moment, the act has been done. Just stay away from him and don’t sit near him. 

If something like this happens again, you know how to react. “What’re you staring at?” Gives the invitation to explain themselves, so you can evaluate further. Drawing conclusions and raising your voice because you feel threatened is a natural reaction, but now you know to question the situation first.

Overall, do whatever your gut tells ya"
soc_163474,socialskills,reddit_comment,303,"Someone in another sub asked how to handle lonliness. The following was my response.

I would say it is impossible to handle. You can endure it but you can't handle it forever. 

So you need to learn how to get friends. The other option is literally being alone, forever. A lot worse than social anxiety!

1. Socialskills are learn able. 

2. Use every situation as learning option. 

3. Be confident, not shy. Put yourself out there. Don't be a closed book, self disclosure leads to people opening up to you and in return liking you more. 

4. Treat people like they are already your friends.

5. When you are unsure why someone didn't show interest in you, or didn't invite you just assume that they do like you but are lacking social skills.

6. The best friend is always the neighbor. With him there are no logistic problems, he has time when your other friends are booked out. He has friends get to know them when you are there.

7. Common interests are a great way to make new friends, mostly because you randomly cross paths regularly. 

8. Start doing hobbies in clubs/groups. You will get to know many people there. If you don't have hobbies which you can do in clubs or to less of them go try it out. You will probably just have fun.

9. Friendships take time and effort to blossom. Show and be genuinely interested in others.

10. It is your job to be liked, not your job to make them dislike you. Let them find out why they shouldn't want to hang out with you.

So this is just from the top of my head. There is much more to it but when you accept the #1 and do #2 you will learn it in no time.

I just told them “I didn’t have anything to really add to the conversation”. If you’re confident with who you are, which is a quiet person, then embrace it and try not to worry about it. I couldn’t care less that I’m quiet, I’ll talk whenever I feel like it. I do remain professional and friendly though whenever I am brought into conversations."
soc_124779,socialskills,reddit_comment,173,"I used to feel this way when I was about your age too. I'm now 23 and looking back on it because I was afraid they may have been mocking me I missed out on alot of opportunities with alot of girls. one of the best pieces of advice I've ever heard which has helped me tremendously is to always assume attraction. Assume that they are coming up to you because you are attractive and approach the situation with confidence from that stand point. You'll be much calmer, feel more powerful and in control and easily handle the situation. whats the worst that can happen? they are teasing you and then you find out? you've lost nothing, they are mean people who you wouldn't want to associate with anyway so you can thank them for showing you that upfront rather than wasting your time and you finding that out down the road.

bottom line, always assume attraction and handle situations with confidence, youve got nothing to lose my friend!(or should i say mate?) "
soc_40972,socialskills,reddit_comment,138,"It's a bit childish, so it depends on the person, but I'm a personal fan of the whole sitting-side-by-side-and-he-sways-over-to-bump-my-shoulder move. It's an instant way of telling if I like him back, too, because if I were uncomfortable I'd let out a nervous laugh, but if I liked him back I'd sway back and playfully nudge his shoulder. It's innocuous, it can be played off easily, and it's natural. Most guys I know that have done it do it during a lull in an otherwise good, comfortable conversation.

The other suggestions here are good too, for the most part. Light, quick forearm touching is good. However, I'd personally stay away from the shoulders, waist and back. A hand on my shoulder makes me want to instinctively shrug it off, and a hand on my back or waist feels creepy."

I do want to say, on the off chance you get frustrated because nothing is happening, I want to be very clear that I was a dense moron, probably still am when it comes to girls showing interest in me. He could be, maybe even probably is, the same. He may keep telling himself you are just being polite or friendly. Especially if you decide you want to go the next level. He may never get it, you may think he doesn't like you. It's very difficult to know without being direct sometimes.  If it gets that point, you will have to decide if it's worth risking the friendship to be very direct with your wants.

Personal setting: really depends on personal preference of the people you greet. I have friends (male and female) that we tend to greet with hugs, however I've established their consent to do so and check in often. 

If you want to greet friends (friends partners) with a hug you should be comfortable hugging regardless of gender expression and should always ask for consent before stretching out your arms. If they say ""No"" don't push the matter. Receive a ""No"" with grace and move on. It might be hard to hear a ""no"" but it's even harder for someone especially women to say ""No"" because of physical threats from men and being raised to people please."
soc_215058,socialskills,reddit_comment,752,"Okay, Bro topic. I get what you're talking about, but the first thing you need to do is man up. My flaw is being unable to man up when life gets twisted, too. I've had a few similar situations, mostly in college.

I'm going to give you a Teddy Roosevelt quote ""In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing."" Right now, you have a choice to make: what are you going to do about this problem? The first thing you need to do is dump some cold water on your head and snap out of it, and then pay attention. You're getting paralyzed by the situation. It's a common mistake for high school-age kids to make. If that sounds condescending, I don't mean for it to be, I've only lived a handful more years.

First step is to think. What do you want? Do you want just casual encounters like you've had with girl X so far? Or do you think you might want something serious? That has a serious impact on your next move. Make a decision. 

After you've made your decision, go with it. If you want to casually fool around with girls, go for it. If you think you might want something more serious, do that. Whatever you decide is your own lifestyle choice to make, and the only people who matter in that are you, the girls, and until you're living on your own, your parents. 

You're a junior in high school. Take a deep breath and look at the big picture. I think I keep in touch with maybe 10 people I knew in high school, and that's after having tight-knit squads of all kinds of people (I even hung out with a few jocks) adding up to about 10 times that number. I really only seriously keep in touch with 3 or 4. And that's nothing compared to the friends I've made, turned away, and lost during another 4 years of college. Don't worry so much, the odds are huge that either of these girls are going to mean anything to you after high school, unless you wind up in a long term relationship/getting married to one, in which case it turns out to be a good thing. So calm down, it's not the end of the world if girls talk about you. Worst-case scenario is nobody cares in 20 years, just like 90% of everyone. 

If that's still not enough, I'll put it in perspective with an interesting halloween party I went to in 2014. I got there with my signature party supplies: a fifth of captain, a liter of coke, and two bottles of powerade for when those are gone. Yes, I drink all of that in about 4 hours. I don't recommend it, and what happens next is why. After about an hour, I've got some number of cups in me, when this guy comes up to me with a lightsaber from some guy's jedi costume. I happen to be going as a Jedi, too, with the same costume. I also happen to be captain of my school fencing team. This guy comes up and says we should duel because I have skills. The last thing I remember is pouring one more cup to even the playing field a bit more. I heard later he was able to disarm me, but I grappled him, kidney punched him, took his lightsaber from him, then drunkenly chased him down a city block, only to come back and tell 5 different girls that I liked them. I don't even know two of them, I'm certainly not attracted to them, and they also work closely a lot with the fraternity I'm in, and we were just starting to get on better terms after several years of bad relations. 

So don't worry so much. Nobody cares what happens in high school, college involves a ton of getting drunk and doing stupid shit you're going to laugh about for the rest of your life. Best of all you've already come out of this situation ahead with a story about some dumbass college kid who got too drunk and embarrassed himself WAY more than most people ever do. Think of that whenever you feel like you're being stupid, and you can even tell the story to other people for some laughs if you feel like it. "
soc_885449,socialskills,reddit_comment,277,"Hey, I’ve been in this boat as well. Everything you described is a reflection of my first few years of undergrad. Even though this might be extremely difficult, I suggest doing your best to take initiative when it comes to friendships. Make small talk with people in your classes, eventually ask if they want to study together, and perhaps you can start to form more meaningful relationships. Don’t be afraid to join clubs with like minded people. It can be intimidating going alone, but the student leaders of these organizations will do their best to make everyone feel welcome. If you are a regular member, they will notice and chat you up. Perhaps join a team of some sort, like a research lab or a volunteering group where you must work together to achieve a common goal. In these contexts, it’s so much easier to get to know people without the pressure of small talk. Seek a therapist at your school, if you need one. The worst part is getting yourself there, but once you are, be proud of your decision to help yourself. 
You are so very important to this world, and it’s highly possible that the people you thought forgot about you are wondering how you’re doing. They themselves might be longing to reach out. College is weird. The best way to go about it is to be straightforward with your feelings, trust your gut, forget the people who make you feel crappy, look forward and don’t feel pressured to run at the same pace as everyone else. You will get through this rough time, I believe in you! Happiness is coming very, very soon."

You can't just ""forget"" about it when there is no valid reason. Yes you should concentrate on yourself but you can't ignore your needs.

The best way to ""move on"" would be to actually talk to her. See if she has that interesting of a personality, if you get along well. Ask her out. If she rejects you, awesome you can now focus on yourself like you originally planned to. If she says yes then you just got yourself a date.

soc_1355280,socialskills,reddit_comment,196,"Yeah so just because somebody is awesome, and has no reason to be unconfident, that exist independently of their internal self-talk. For example, people who have been in a relationship with Kim Kardashian have described her as deeply insecure. Does it make much sense? no. But on a personal level it explains a lot. 

Seeking outside validation, whether through money, sexual attractiveness or attention is never gonna work to fill that hole because the problem is internal, it'll never be enough. That's why you have people who seem like they have it all, but are still deeply unhappy, but now they can't even share it because they seem ""out of touch"" and will isolate and make the problem worse. 

But once again the most important thing is knowing the person one on one, but in my to experience the person that feels the need to say ""I'm a good person"" usually ain't. The guy who keeps trying to brag about how smart he is, is either the dumbest one or insecure about something. I have never known an actually confident, happy person that does stuff like that. Hurt people hurt people 🤷 just my two cents."
soc_1629288,socialskills,reddit_comment,311,"I've struggled with this myself for about 13 years now-- the last time I clicked with someone and truly did not feel alone was around 7 years ago. The *only* thing I've found that makes me feel better is having an ongoing social outlet that you know has a possibility to connect you with people around your age who would have something in common with you.   
   
People are always going to treat hobbies as the solution because there is a fundamental truth to it. It's not about distracting yourself from feeling lonely, it's about learning to regulate your own emotions-- in particular by channelling them into something usually creative, like art or building something. This is a form of learning discipline, which is why it's so hard.   
  
The way I always thought about it was, I have to spend all this time on solitary hobbies &amp; interests because those things will make me a more interesting person to be around. It's a frustrating, necessary barrier to get to what I actually want, which is to socialize and have friends. And I think, if you never accept that this is actually about having to grow up (or rather, become a stronger person) and learn to self sooth, then this problem of loneliness is going to chase you through life and eventually catch up to you, someday. Because everyone goes through dark periods in their lives, and very often, there simply will not be anyone around who you feel really understands you.  
  
So yeah. The former (an outlet) will offer the most relief, because it'll give you hope. But I think it's worth trying to find an actual outlet for these feelings of loneliness. Mine is reading and weekly movies, btw; whatever you choose, make sure it's not something you turn your brain off and binge (like 'junk food' TV or youtube)-- unless."
soc_1822515,socialskills,reddit_comment,301,"Find a purpose in life, independent of the validation of others. If you're desperately seeking validation from others, then you're going to be emotionally dependent on others, which can significantly hold you back from leading a purposeful and satisfying life.

I would recommend focusing on yourself from now, whether that be physical fitness, strengthening yourself mentally/educationally, and focusing on personal and social responsibility.

If you're doing the right thing in life, doing right by your family, yourself, and your community, you'll find that you'll eventually not have such a low sense of self-worth or self-esteem. And you'll eventually find that people will gravitate towards you. However, once that starts to happen, it's up to you to weed out the good from the bad.

Why *exactly* do you have a such a low opinion of yourself? Is it simply because you don't have friends, or do you feel that that being quiet and shy, and other things about yourself, justify people not being your friend or wanting to get to know you?

If you're responsible and do what's right, and people still don't want to get to know you or befriend you, then they likely wouldn't have made good friends, would they? Who would pass up the chance to make friends with an honest and sincere person?

Also, maybe seek out environments with people who are similarly shy and quiet, or share your interests. Check out any local groups, or if you're religious, your local church, synagogue or mosque. The last three are great places to meet friendly people, whereas local groups, sky's the limit. There's book clubs, chess clubs, hiking clubs, bowling clubs, and so on. Their groups specifically created for people who have a hard time making new friends or just people who want to get to know new people."

&amp;#x200B;

""I once tried to explain depression to someone as like if one day you gradually started to lose both your sense of taste and your ability to feel full. And you don't know why, but now everything you eat tastes like mashed potatoes and nothing you eat is satisfying. You keep eating because you must eat to live, but the effort it takes to prepare food is taxing and there is no payoff. You just know it will taste like mashed potatoes, and you know you will still be hungry. So you stop bothering with seasonings. Then you stop bothering to use ingredients you used to like. Then you start to wonder what the point of eating is because there is no payoff. You still feel hungry and you're sick of the taste and don't know if you will ever enjoy food again and you don't know why this is happening.

If someone comes up to you in this scenario and says, ""Well have you tried spicing your food? Using different ingredients? Eating foods you used to love?"" It isn't necessarily helpful because the reason you stopped doing all that in the first place is that everything...tasted...like mashed...potatoes.""

Now, you need a complete makeover. First, get a job or a hustle. Save enough to spend and still have money.

Get yourself a new hairstyle and wear new clothes that are fashionable. Act around people like you're a foreigner and that you're exploring the city that you're in. Also, learn a foreign language like French or German. No Japanese or Spanish, everyone knows that!!! 

Then, do some networking with people who are extremely social. You don't find em in high school (it's very clique oriented) and you can find social people in Social Events, Non Profits, Sport Classes (Not Gym but Martial Arts clubs) &amp; in downtown areas. So, Google em right away! 

Be a person of value when you meet these people. If you don't have any value to offer, intern at high end offices in area of your choice. If these people like you, they'll just hit you up to hangout or for attending parties of high nature. Not some shitty lame Halloween party but high network worthy ones. 

Now, what will happen is, everyone in your school will wonder what is wrong with you cuz you're upgrading. People will look at you cuz you look different with the hairstyle and clothes you wear. Also, you'll meet people who will make you go forward in life faster unlike your confused and dazed high school classmates.

By the time, you reach 25, you would be in a better place than 99% of your class. Suffer now and enjoy later! Halloween parties suck and you know that. Focus on making $$$. $$$&gt;Halloween party.

soc_93985,socialskills,reddit_comment,708,"&gt; If you feel this way, others probably felt the same way too. Same way as you don't want to talk to people who bores you, other people don't want that either.

Let me describe a situation at the last meetup. When I arrived, most of the center table was taken, so I seated myself at one of the outer tables with fewer people. We made a round of introductions, and afterwards the person I was sitting next to discussed his project with me. However, he was actually in the process of leaving so there was no opportunity for me to help him.

Afterwards, I was alone and every other seat was already filled, so there was no chance to try and join more people. No more than 20 minutes passed before another person approached me. He began discussing his business ideas, and telling me the details for his potential project. I politely listened and I realized he had no technical skills to speak of, but wanted someone to create his project for him. I didn't even hint at that fact, but I continued being polite. After a while, he realized I wasn't going to offer up my skills to help him, so he left.

Toward the end of the night, one of the organizers realized I was not teamed up with an existing group, so he offered to help me find a group. I finally did talk to another group who needed some help, but their application required knowledge I didn't have. I quietly tried to install the necessary applications to eventually learn how to help them. But having that level of knowledge would have required at least 10-12 hours of trying things and reading before I would be useful.

When I left that night I felt like I got nothing accomplished, in comparison to the previous time I was there when I managed to get at least a little code to someone who could use it. I will probably show up there again, but I need more skills before I can be useful. So I may not show up there for a while, since learning new skills is kind of low on my priority list. Much higher is trying to solve the issue I mentioned in my post.

&gt; So if you want to meet interesting people, start being interesting yourself. Talk more about stuff you like, 

At work everyone I talk to knows I like bitcoin. I could go on for a while about bitcoin, but to be honest I've already said everything I know about bitcoin. So that topic has dried up.

There are other things I'm interested in, but I haven't encounter a proper opportunity to bring them up. I mean, I've met people who have a knack for just walking up to you and talking about what they find interesting without any invitation, and I personally think it's a bit distasteful. So if no opportunities present themselves, and I don't go out of my way to make them, nor do I know how to make them, then they don't happen.

&gt; listen A LOT what others have to say. 

A few of the people I work with have tried to listen to what I've told them about my life and they seem to only pick up on the least interesting parts of it. I'm not sure how I could prevent myself from making the same mistakes they have.

&gt; And maybe after meeting more people, you will find one that has lots of things in common with you, and then an acquantaince can become a friend.

Things are much more difficult when you're an adult, when everyone else has a wife and a house and already have established a life. I'm not saying their impossible, but that's what I'm up against. When I was younger, I had less trouble making a few friends here and there. Adults, on the other hand, have less free time. When I had nothing better to do, there were more opportunities to make friends. Now I have a full time job, so I feel like I have to take every chance I get a bit more seriously. So far I haven't gotten much good advice on that."

The more you try it the more comfortable you get, I would say venture off to places close to home and you’re familiar with first!

soc_1571675,socialskills,reddit_comment,391,"i mean yeah definitely, if both parties are mature and know their boundaries i don’t see why its a problem, obviously gaining feelings is a factor but personally i think it only goes to that point when boundaries aren’t respected and both of them goes over line at times allow the other to cross the friendship boundary which lets the other know theres a possible chance of getting with them . however i do believe of u had a previous relationship with the friend it will never work out and its a red flag but it depends on circumstances 🤷🏻‍♀️. 

i had a friend who i had previous history with however it was years ago and we cane to an agreement that we were young and curious and the “relationship” wasnt anything serious, now we both have grown up into adults and we decided to stay friends. we set boundaries and made it clear that this friendship will no longer continue if either of us gains feelings and both of us will strictly stay friends and expect nothing more. till this day we have been good friends and he has never made a move on me and both us constantly give each other advice on the other genders perspective and constantly look out for each other. we compliment each others looks and call each other attractive just like how we do with our friends and neither of us feel uncomfortable or get the wrong idea,  because our intentions and boundaries are clear. our families are super close too and they trust each other and tbh it’s actually super fun having a guy best friend in my opinion and its reassuring knowing u have someone who u can rely on especially because the idea of getting with anyone is not on my mind right now and sometimes i just want help from a guy who doesn’t think im hitting on him or think i want something from him and having a guy friend has helped me heaps cus i can always reach out to him if i need anything. 

i also feel like it’s important to have a friend who is the opposite gender because it allows you to get a honest opinion on how the other gender feels or thinks and helps u understand an individual better and the perspective better."

You're asking for advice on a social skills forum - you seem frustrated by the situation - it's ultimately your decision. 
 

I'm saying that if you're not comfortable with what has happened and you want to avoid it happening again, then I'd suggest learning to glean the context of a social situation non-verbally and therefore figure out what is appropriate and inappropriate to do to - it's something that comes naturally to some but not all. If you're asking for my opinion on any action, to me it's socialising in-person that improves this most, so talk to your peers more if you can - and if that's difficult, this subreddit is full of success stories, if you look, read and learn it's sure to help understand social situations more in at least some way, if that's more your cup of tea."

You have to enjoy it, not feel like it’s a burden. Whenever you hit the ball or say something, make it worthwhile, and when the other person doesn’t talk back naturally but it forced to, it’s like failing to hit the ball back properly. The game won’t work and so you’re not meant to “click” with that person. Just move on.

You might not be having fun, but they sure as hell will think the conversation is fun since people love talking about themselves; so much so that at the end of the conversation, the person you were talking to will walk away thinking you are a good conversationalist when really you just asked questions and listened actively.

If you posted what you wanted, even if you fucked up or made a mistake, if someone points out the mistake, THEN you could either apologize and be like ""oh I see , I wasn't aware of that."" and then take action to amend the mistake. Basically, you'd be going from apologizing for your presence, to anticipating social success, and trusting yourself to deal with potential conflict as it happens.

By trial and error I improved my social skills, oh god so many akward moments. But I knew I was not at fault, I just needed more experience. Now years later, I have a girlfriend and many good friends. My social skills are now excellent.

It is entirely based on attitudes and expectations. Throw them out. They’re garbage. It’s your attitudes and expectations that will keep you from being a part of any tribe, keep you from doing anything. That’s your baggage.
It’s like walking around with two sacks in your hands, complaining that you can’t do anything because you’re stuck holding useless sacks. Fucking drop your baggage. Or don’t. It doesn’t matter either way to me. It’s up to you to decide if it matters to you."

Everyone in college seems to have made friends group or know everyone already, I just walk around on my own. For breaks I just leave the college and walk up and down different roads, and me too I like being alone (sometimes) but when I see people with their friends and laughing, going to parties and having fun. I feel so isolated and empty, I have no teenage life, never had a girlfriend, never kissed a girl or even hugged one, never been to a party, I’ve never even gone out with my friends. My teenage/ social life is non existent. Maybe college will be like this for the whole 2 years but so be it. The way I see it I don’t have much going for me, I have body dysmorphia, no confidence, I’m definitely not smart and overall I’m what everyone would consider a loser. I feel you on a spiritual level bro, maybe we can trade socials because I honestly feel like I’m the only one, plus I kinda want someone to talk to, it’s up to you but I would love to talk to you more about feeling lonely man."

No more mr nice guy is talking about that. And nothing else. If you lower yourself to a point when you take your dignity any everything to please others they will start walk all over you. Even if your intentions are the best. Up to ask point when they lose respect towards you. 

And it's still up to you to realize you are not put on this world to please everyone, to help everyone with most basic things.

Thing is that people can help themselves. And it's most efficient. If, for example, you help me, I will feel better, but if I do the right thing I'll get more shit done and felt even better. On the long run, helping myself would be better.

soc_427152,socialskills,reddit_comment,190,"Like the account name. Very specific. Lol.

I'm not gay, but it's possible people think I'm gay. The thing is, I don't do any of the obvious gay tells: High-pitched voice, dramatic body language, and I don't act girly.

And yet I've had a few women ask me if I'm gay. All of these women were rejected by me, a few weeks after the rejection, they'd all tell me things like how some guy thinks I'm gay. One even went as far as to say that everyone thinks I'm gay (which is fine).

But it seems odd to me... Because if everyone thought I was gay then don't see why women would constantly be getting attracted to me.  Women generally don't like girly men or even straight men who act gay. And yet I have women fawning over me all of the time, confessing to me, or trying to go out on dates with me. And I don't think women would be into me if I actually seemed gay.

So I'm curious to know what might make a person think you're gay (despite not seeming gay). If that makes sense."
soc_393822,socialskills,reddit_comment,150,"I think you should drop them for personal growth. It’s impossible to keep everyone you’ve meet in your life. However, that doesn’t mean you should ghost them. Let them know you aren’t the same person as you once were and how much they meant to you and how great your times together were. If they are true friends, they will completely understand that you have changed. On another note, how do you expect to progress if you’re being drawn back into the past? It’s nice to reflect on old memories, but only every so often. I speak from experience, I had to drop my best friend of 7 years who I talked to and hung out with nearly every single day during middle school and high school. Eventually you just grow up, and you aren’t the same person/you don’t have time like you used. 

Best of luck in your decision!"
soc_795271,socialskills,reddit_comment,700,"You basically have it down. There is advice that applies universally though. For example, boundaries and assertiveness serve as an armour from manipulation, and allow you to meet your needs. The path to solidify that is through real life experience. Everyone has room to ""level up"". As you get older, you tend to get complacent and do what works enough for you to be able to shoulder the rest. Its why a lot of ""naturals"" with great chidhood social experiences dont evolve much beyond the basic traditional path. It worked for them, and theyre not aware of whats possible beyond that.

Anyways, I dont want to recommend anything extreme because I dont want to be responsible for putting you on that path. Ill give you a general idea of whats been working for me, but its a slow and painful process. As a simple one, aim to reach your body's full potential. It will center you, make you feel really good, and make you look way better. Id say aim for 10-12% BF with the highest natural weight possible for your body. This is a lifelong process but its indicating to yourself that you can achieve SOMETHING, that youre aiming for the best for YOU (not caring what people think about it, but how good it makes you feel), and that to get somewhere, you need to stick to it. Its not vain. Its a promise to yourself not to give up on yourself. As an added bonus, you feel and look great. Life looks better. Dont obssess 24/7 over your look though, but its fine to appreciate the progress. 3 full body workouts a week 1-2h), with moderate calorie supervision will get you there over time.

As you do this, go to the gym when its busy, usually in the evening. You will be forced to interact with EVERYONE. Men, women, hot people, angry people etc. Youll be sharing machines at times or having to hold your ground. Imagine doing this 3 times a week. Its creating positive social conditioning, youre getting to interact with all kinds of people and honing your skills, and theres the added benefits of working out that I mentioned. Also, the more you can do your workout without caring, the less that others' perceptions of you will matter. This will help later with girls.

These are the basics though. But this is a bare minimum to not completely isolate yourself from people. Theres the ""wear fitting clothes and groom"" which makes you presentable and feel good, but i shouldnt even mention these. This is the bare minimum for giving yourself the best chances at playing the game of life. And you dont realize that until you do it consistently and see the change over time.

Now that youre doing something ar least, you need a purpose. This will be the source of your wtf moments. Are you really satisfied with your job? No? Give yourself a few months at most to set-up an exit strategy and quit to give a shot for what youre interested in. You might lose money and time, but that experience will be priceless. Or if you cant get girls, go through the cringe of getting a PUA mentor (who may be younger than you) to show you the ropes. It could be something you end up thinking isnt for you, but you dont know unless you try. Even then, you at least you have the real life perspective of doing PUA. And if you do succeed, you could settle into only using those skills when you want a relationship or sex.

 I cant give you step by step examples so ill just explain it so you know how to find and chase them. An experience that forces you to claw your way out, question your values, and/or distorts your perspectivs is a wtf experience. Theres different degrees of this, but youre basically taking the risk and saying fuck it lets see where this takes me. Its up to you though. But BE CAUTIOUS. You cant half-dive into that life and escape. Youll hate yourself more and wont get far. If you decide to do it, either commit or don't."
soc_680809,socialskills,reddit_comment,120,"Damn you think they have so many real friends to hang out with? Just like many said in the comments, the grass is always greener....
A lot of people often hang out together only once a week and most of the time they try to catch a tinder date or go to the gym, sports whatsoever ALONE. 

That isn't necessarily bad, but as long as you're not satisfied with being at ease with yourself, you will always feel that you miss out on something, doesn't matter how many social acquaintances you have. Just my opinion (and experience)

If you really feel like lacking social interactions you can always join some meetups, sports teams, etc. to get to know new people."

I had to take a look at how he managed his relationships in order to recognize that I had several missed opportunities to keep in touch with people. I would always let other people make the first move because I don't want people to hang out with me out of obligation. Your friends do have the option to say 'no' or avoid your call altogether, but they continue to not just answer the phone, but say 'yes'.

I'm really sorry this happened, it's definitely a shitty situation. Maybe you should talk to him? Let him know that when you make plans with someone you take them seriously, and him bailing - on your birthday, without notice - was really disrespectful. And if he didn't want to go he should have been upfront with you, instead of letting you down like this.

Unfortunately I don't have much advice other than keep trying. You're always going to run into people who are selfish, self-centered, or just plain mean. Try not to let them get you down. You are worthy of friends that take your needs and feelings into account, and the only way to meet those people is to put yourself out there.

Try going to places that you're interested in, and meeting people there. If you like academics, try going to events that deal with your chosen field - is anyone giving a talk at a library or event center? People in your classes that show enthusiasm about the topic during class. Looking online for meetups or study groups that cover topics that interest you.

I hope you have a better birthday next year, with people who appreciate you.

I get why it's confusing you, because you make your decision and then get bombarded with the opposite. Been there.

soc_86885,socialskills,reddit_comment,308,"It depends on how you're getting complimented.

If people are using the compliment as an opener, they'll usually give an example of something attractive about you too, unless they're a complete amateur.  Your hair, your eyes, and more often than not, the way you dress.

So you've instantly got something you can talk about, but start by saying 'thank you', then return the compliment if they're hot, or if they're not, just smile.

Generally speaking (and I am generalising here), if a hot girl says ""Hey you're hot,"" but gives no reason why, she just wants attention from a hot guy, and probably lacks imagination, so I'd steer clear.  Hot girls are used to interactions like this, they're complimented all the time, she knows what she likes to hear, and if all she can say is ""You're hot,"" either she lacks imagination or that kind of facile thing is good enough for her (and therefore she's probably not good enough for you).  If you do still want to have sex with her though because she's hot (and again I wouldn't advise it), now's the time to learn about negging.

But if she makes the effort to both compliment you, and leave the conversation a little bit open (in any way), you should reward the effort, compliment her back, explain where you got the clothes she complimented, or joke and say, ""Really?  That's nice to hear, when I was a kid people said I had a Mick Jagger mouth,"" (assuming it's your mouth she's talking about...)

But always, always, regardless of anything else, say thank you, even if she doesn't put any effort into the compliment.

Even if she wolf-whistles at you from across the street, either shout, or run over to her, and say thank you with a big smile on your face.  It'll be charming as fuck."
soc_267237,socialskills,reddit_comment,140,"I think this is largely just a question of personal preference in how social media plays a part in your life.  
I purely use Facebook messenger and don't check updates and found it works really well for me, it means I have a good reason to talk to more people and catch up on things and avoids me wasting time scrolling through posts I don't particularly care about.  I also think it strengthens the relationship I've got between certain people, rather than just posting a happy birthday message on their wall going through the effort of actually talking to them and not being prompted by Facebook can mean a lot.  

Arguably putting yourself out there more on Facebook might help spark new relationships but in my experience, not doing so has strengthened relationships between people I talk to more regularly.

soc_1246480,socialskills,reddit_comment,407,"I have.

1. She’s not into you in any way.

2. She’s a girl. She has thirsty idiots and free attention that you don’t have. This gives you more time to think of her and less time for her to think of you.

3. You’re coming off needy. Tell her you’re done with her. She isn’t worth your stress and your life. If she ignores you then she doesn’t care. Move on. I would move on at this point already.

Oh and I just remembered the saddest part.

4. She was most likely using you. Most (not all, seriously) females see friends differently than males do. Males see friendships as bonds and family. Females see friends as a tool or asset. When you can no longer provide (she moved away) she’s done with you as a friend.

There was a story a guy posted about a girl he met at the bus stop. Here’s what I remember:
He and a girl would would show up at the same bus stop at 5AM, it was very dark. The girl would ignore him and stay far away. One time he said “hi” to her and they made small talk for the first time. She then said “I thought you were a creep. Good thing you can be my friend. You can protect me from other creeps and bad people!” They were friends for a few months and she was very friendly to him. One day he showed up but she wasn’t there. He got on the bus and there she was. Turned out she had moved away (sounds familiar huh?) so that particular stop was no longer her morning stop where she would wait in the dark. Now she was on the bus ahead of him. He waved hi to her and she ignored him. He didn’t think much of it that day but every time he got on the bus she continued to ignore him. He then realized that girls don’t make friends like guys do, they make friends on special terms. She no longer needed him. He was hurt by it but it was a tough lesson.

Look, I know neckbeards and angry women are gonna call me an “incel” and other immature irrelevant off-topic shit and maybe even YOU will do this. But I just plant the seed of truth and it’s up to you to water it or crush it because you can’t handle it."
soc_678227,socialskills,reddit_comment,345,"Idk man, Im kinda late to the party but Ive read a few of the top comments and none of them say to just be honest. So just be honest.

The other day I read about electron teleportation and it was so freaking cool, when I was talking to a coworker I told her ""hey did you know teleportation is a thing?!"" and she was really genuinely excited. Turns out its a bit more complicated but whatever it filled the conversation which led to other topics. 

"" I don't really have any hobbies besides YouTube and Reddit. ""... So fucking what thats like 60% of everyone else just say thats what you like. If you passionate about a certain channel tell them, if you like to watch a certain youtuber tell them. Its just talking so talk even if it sounds lame who cares lame is better than awkward silence. Dont give up keep trying, trust me eventually, just by talking about what you like, youll eventually meet likeminded people! Also your coworker is not an ass for calling you boring, forget the self  righteous people here. She is a person entitled to her own opinons and she can say what ever she wants.

soc_182641,socialskills,reddit_comment,778,"Ok, hi.  I've been ""me"" and freely vulnerable for a very long time and I've learned some painful lessons along the way.  
  
Big thing, you gotta know who to trust.  Being vulnerable means you're giving the other person everything they need to destroy you emotionally and socially.  A friend is going to take that information and use it to give you very potent help.  An asshole is going to use it to get one up on you at an opportune time.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**So how do you know who to trust and who to distrust?**  
  
Well, **you have to figure out what they value in life.**  What motivates them to go through life.  What topics do they frequently bring up?  What do they get excited about?  What are they embarrassed about?  What do they hate?  What kind of influences do they put into their lives?  How do they handle tests and struggles?  How do they treat people of obvious lower status?  What do they do with power?  
  
The big categories I can think of right now are Image-driven people, Love-driven, Laziness-driven, People-pleasers, Complainers/victims, Explorers (growth-oriented), and selfish greedy motherfuckers.  
  
**Find people driven by love, growth, and exploration.**  In my experience, they are going to be who you can trust the most.  They are going to be the most honest with you.  They are going to take care of your well-being the best, and they're going to do the most with your gifts that you give them.  They are going to be the most supportive people in your life, and they're going to help you the most when you're down.  
  
A good trick to find out the most about someone, is to **give them complete fuckin power over you and just see what the fuck they do with it.**  Like, ask them about something you're really bad at.  Or, my personal favorite, ask them about something you know a lot about and see if they spew bullshit or not.  (an ""oh, I don't know"" will award them insta-friend status).  And if they lord over you or shit on you, then fuck them, they get *no* mercy when the group finds out I'm actually a boss hahaha.  But if they're super sweet and help you, then they're good friends.  
  
**And find people that have their own shit going on outside of you.**  Like, be extremely cautious with someone who has nothing going on in their lives and they seem to always leech off your life.  They have caused the most *drama* and *bullshit* in my life because they just don't take care of themselves and they allow any random bullshit into their lives.  They'll be a lot fun to party with, but they will completely wreck your life if you're too attached to them.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**And how do you be you in a new social situation when there could potentially be a snake there?**  
  
Basically, be comfortable having your weaknesses and insecurities out in the open, so no one can hurt you socially or emotionally.  Be ok with your weaknesses.  Either accept them and be the first to admit them, or start working on improving them and take pride in it.  I've turned the tables on a few assholes (""friends"" HAHAHA) in group settings when they tried to embarrass me about something I told them in confidence, and then I just **owned** it and made them look like *assholes*, and then retook my dominance.  Fuck those guys man.  But they're fucking everywhere and they hide really well, so you just gotta be prepared to have all your dirty laundry out in the open.  
  
And always be honest, but don't *fucking* tell everyone everything about you right off the bat.  Make them *earn* your trust.  Slowly build intimacy and see how they react to different things.  If they fail a test, back off and run away for a bit (conversationally).  You can always retest them later and see if they're worthy of your gifts.  But if they keep failing the saaaame test (like shitting on another person, or complaining about some petty bullshit, or lying to your face to try to gain your approval), then just set your boundary of intimacy right there and never go past it with them.  Now yall are friends and they just think you're a quiet guy.  When really, you just don't trust them.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
Ok man, that's all I got.  Good luck!  Feel free to ask more questions.  And I guess as a closing line, ""you attract what you *are*, not what you *want*"".  So become who you want to be friends with, and you'll naturally attract them into your life. (if that makes sense  hahaha)"
soc_933087,socialskills,reddit_comment,127,"This is like a reoccuring theme i see around here. People (myself included) fall in love with people that aren't what you would even call close friends. Often enough even when the other person has already made it very clear that nothing will happen.
I'd say try to move on. However, why would you have to decide between telling her and cutting her off, which would result in the same? 

My general advice: take her out and tell her. Maybe the evening would go well and you become a couple. Maybe that doesn't happen. Depending on her reaction, decide if you even want to stay her friend. There's a lot of nice people out there. It's a numbers game after all, and luck will always be involved."
soc_1046019,socialskills,reddit_comment,181,"Lol that's so presumptuous to think that no one over the age of 20 knows anything about Snapchat. We were on Snapchat before you could muster up enough literacy to read the word Snapchat.

It doesn't mean anything special on snapchat. It depends on the person, and nothing is true for all people. It is not a function of snapchat itself, but rather the people who are hitting you up on snapchat are probably just the people who are most likely to send a ""hey wyd"" message.   
The thing with snapchat is that you can quickly send the same snap to many people at once with little effort. For many people, it is a low effort way to fish for conversation and/or attention. Even lower effort than a ""wyd"" text.... I would be wary of anyone who sends that as a conversation started unless they immediately follow it up with something of note. If they are just asking you what's up to try to coax you into having a conversation with them, they probably don't have anything worth talking about anyway."

Personally, (and I am coming from a bias American cultural viewpoint), I would never date someone who doesn't at least offer to pick up the tab once in a while.  


I was speaking to my wife about this the other night.  Before we met and I was still dating, doing the online thing from time to time, first dates were generally always at fun or more relaxed bars.  I'd always buy the first round.  If my date didn't offer to get a round the whole night, that would be the first and last date.  Definitely happened a couple of times and some were really surprised when I didn't call back.  


Of course my wife offered to buy the next round after I bought the first our first time hanging out.  Very first sign I knew she was a keeper :-).  Now married and living together we share finances and responsibilities.  We're a great team.  


If that's what you're looking for in a partner, take your experience as a big red flag and address it with her.  She may decide she doesn't want to be in that kind of partnership or she may say she'll pick up the slack and won't.  Then you'll get more insight into whether you want to date her.  "

You have to decide if the other factors make these people worth keeping around and no one else in this thread should be making that decision for you. If they're worth keeping around, temper your expectations and value them for what attention and happiness they can provide. If the lack of emotional support is too much for you, cut them out."
soc_582264,socialskills,reddit_comment,264,"I often feel the same way. The good news is you've won half the battle here.

There's nothing wrong with enjoying your own company and some of us just get too drained to be social all the time. Don't be so hard on yourself, you are allowed to take time for yourself and if you don't feel like being social listen to that feeling.

We all have a limited amount of time in our lives so try to do your best to get the most enjoyment out of it. For example, I have a decent amount of friends but I give those in my close circle priority. The people I really enjoy being around are the ones I choose to spend the most time with, everyone else I see at social events or when I'm up for it. So you don't have to sacrifice all of your time to being social but put in that extra mile for your good friends.

If you're trying to work on your social skills and anxiety, push yourself every so often to go out and engage with friends when you don't feel like it. Often times, when you make yourself go out you'll actually enjoy yourself. However, you should balance this out by letting yourself stay in sometimes without feeling guilty. 

What and who you spend your time on is up to you. Don't feel guilty about wanting to stay in but try and make sure you are at least putting in the time and effort with your close friends, all the other ones will come and go."
soc_929942,socialskills,reddit_comment,503,"This is great advice. As an introvert I learned from my extrovert husband, that sometimes building relationships require us to be vulnerable.  It allows others to see your humanity and unless they are total narcissistic, most people will want to help.

I find it hilarious that my husband has made friends with all the wait staff and baristas in our neighborhood, as a way to cope with our long-time friends being busy raising their kids. We're childless.  He's personal philosophy is that strangers are just friends you haven't met yet, which is alien to me.

He always makes an effort to greet each person individually and before he leaves the establishment, he makes sure to say goodbye.  Over time he gets to know them as people. It doesn't hurt that he tips well, but at the same time he also gets ""special"" discounts.  His interactions are usually genuine and he keeps things light at first.  He is very knowledgeable about beer, wine and spirits, and coffee, and starts there.  It leads to talking about other mutual interests and life.  It takes time to get to know people, to see if you like each other's sense of humor etc.  But it does take repeat effort. If he sees something in the world that he thinks his friends would like or wonder what his friends think/feel about it, he makes the effort to share it with them.

He's also a very open and warm person who likes to tease, and who would casually pat you on the back, or give someone a hug as a greeting or goodbye.  It's part of his personality and he is good enough at reading other people's signals with strangers so it doesn't become awkward or creepy.

I try to learn from his examples, but I'll admit I don't put much effort into keeping up relationships or making new friends, as much as I use to.  I was better at it when I was single.  I also remember how lonely I was and how I craved human touch too.  As with others who have chimed in about this, I hope it helps to know that it is not uncommon.

Relationships need practice, just like small talk, which I personally hate, but have come to think of as a necessary step.  I too prefer interesting and deep conversations, but most relationships in the beginning do not start there. It takes time for people to get comfortable, for the relationship to develop organically.  A book that helped me deal with small talk is, The Art of Conversation by Catherine Blyth. Small talk doesn't need to feel disingenuous or unsubstantial, and it really depends on the person's motives.  It can be a tool to build your interpersonal skills.

You seem like a substantial, reflective, and interesting person who cares.  It's just a matter of showing you care overtly and consistently.  I hope this helps.  You'll be okay, but let us know how you're doing from time to time.  Best of luck to you!"
soc_1602234,socialskills,reddit_comment,416,"&gt;	Any other tips I can incorporate to reverse this ‘signal’ I’m displaying?

Yes. Start by checking out the book *Models* by Mark Manson, followed by *The Way of The Superior Man* by David Dieda. 

These books will help you build your authentic self. The thing about doing so, is that once you work toward more personal authenticity and less neediness, people start to WANT to be around you. It’s weird, but trust me, it works. 

&gt;	Instead, I’m some alien that’s never understood and will forever be ‘different’ from everyone else. I have even stopped trying to connect with people and chalk it up to my ‘different programming’. 

I want you to consider the responsibility of this statement. Based on how it’s written, it seems that it is other people who are responsible for understanding your “different programming.” That is only partially true. See, it’s up to you to take the first steps toward making yourself understandable. 

Your framing makes being accepted an unwinnable battle. And because you’ll always be different, it’s no wonder people don’t want to be around you. It’s a negative self-esteem feedback loop. 

Why do that to yourself? What’s the use of that stance? Do you enjoy feeling sorry for yourself? 

Not trying to be harsh, but think about the purpose of that position. It’s there to garner sympathy, right? But isn’t looking for sympathy almost always needy behavior? (It is) 

I’m gonna suggest you reframe your different programming so that it becomes a strength. 

Say to yourself, “I think differently than others, and that is what makes me valuable. But because I think differently, I will have to work to make it easier for others to understand me. It might not be pleasant at first, but I will get better with practice.” 

See how the responsibility to be understood is now ON YOU? It’s a winnable battle because as you attempt to help others understand you, you will get better at reaching the desired outcome. Does that make sense? 

As for proving you’re good enough, what proof would satisfy you? What are your talents? What can you and you alone authentically offer the world? Isn’t that valuable to a degree? No? Well what is it then? 

That’s why I recommend working toward authenticity. Because when you’re authentically yourself, you learn that you do have some type of intrinsic value that can be embraced. That should be more than enough proof that you don’t need outside validation. 

Does that make sense?"

No they wouldn’t. You explain what happened and they fix it. Do you think if someone took your steak the restaurant would charge *you* to replace it?

Sounds like your still trying to justify your inability to stand up for yourself with mental rationalizations. Seems like you are confusing being nice with being ineffectual. You can be polite and be assertive. But if some is flat out rude, you shouldn’t worry about being polite if you need to call out their behavior. 

I don’t know how to help you via some short written words on the internet. Read some books on being assertive. “Boundaries” is a good one, a bit religious based but the advice is sound. Maybe attend some self-help seminars. Try therapy. Join a boxing gym. Regularly watch John Wayne movies. Not sure what’ll work for you but there is a way. It’s up to you to find it. Good luck, buddy!"
soc_324368,socialskills,reddit_comment,283,"Okay. Let's look into this. 

There are a few reasons why someone would want to talk to a cute girl.

1. They think the girl is cute and want to ""possess"" them. (Please no comments about the word ""possess"" as that's exactly what this is. Any affliction to the body is that of the ego's need to possess as with all the other things).
2. They would like to know something from them.
3. They would want to tell something to them. (Maybe business or anything).

If it is the first reason, the person in question who wants to talk to the cute girl, is of two types.

1. He is not afraid of want anyone thinks of him (even the cute girl's opinion of him). He knows all he can do is put the word out there and accept any consequence that comes his way.
2. He is afraid of the consequence as he is not able to handle rejection in a healthy way. (You see, rejection is like a mini death where you realize you don't matter. Basically every fear finds it source to the fear of ego's death).

Now, I am not gonna tell you what to do. I am just gonna let you ponder over these statements I have made and come to a conclusion yourself unlike a straight forward ""Do this, get that"" or ""That's what's wrong with you"". These kind of statements come from personal experiences and self judgements so they don't hold value when it comes to somebody else's life, whereas the statements I have made have been from my observation of the general consensus. Only you can figure out where you are going wrong! Salut!

soc_1424635,socialskills,reddit_comment,223,"She seems like a very toxic person to be friends with.


To end this relationship with her, you should first be 100% sure that you want that. You have more than enough reasons to end it, but just the fact that you get stressed with just the thought of meeting with her is a big sign that your body is telling you enough. If you are both living together, and you are planning to keep living with her, it's a conversation you shouldn't avoid having.

Explain to her that her behaviors make you uncomfortable, and you don't enjoy being friends with her anymore. People are allowed to change their kinds along the way, and it's completely understandable to realize that you don't want to keep feeling like shit because of her.

Just a warning: she seems like she is a narcissist. It's all about herself, how she is better than others (specifically other girls), and lacking of empathy towards your feelings. People like this tend to be very manipulative, so she might try to convince you to change your mind. This is why it's really important to keep in mind YOUR OWN HAPPINESS. Don't let her get through you, and maintain your decision at all cost. Cutting her out of your life is the best thing you can do for now. Good luck."

I went to about 5/6 parties when I was 18, 30ish when I was 19, about 50 when I was 20, and back to 30ish when I was 21 

A lot 18 year olds are the biggest bullshitters, so a lot them seriously act like they party when in reality they are new to it just like everyone else your age. With that information, you'll fit right in, trust me. If there's anyone there that you would recognize, they would definitely be happy to see you, especially in a different environment like that, so don't be afraid to interact w them.

There are different types of parties and it's easier on yourself when you can identify what type of party it is. With the amount of information I have about this, I'm not sure where to go from here. So I'll tell you what can vaguely help you... 

-match the energy of the room
-be yourself 
-don't try to dont anything you wouldn't normally do
-i would recommmend pre-gaming w a group before if you can
-try to show up w a friend at least, if not it's nbd I have done it plenty
-bring something to enjoy like your own alc if possible, bc people always want to be friends when they want something from you, and when it's a party, no matter what, supplies are always limited, so it's an advantage to have things that people want.. just easier to break the ice and start conversations 
-but I have to say, you can have as good of a time without drinking, it's up to you 
-be loose when you talk to people 
-don't insult anyone
-don't make anyone look bad
-don't insult yourself
-don't make yourself look bad


I wish I could just show you instead and I have to go to bed rn lol but the biggest thing I can tell you is how to avoid any awkward situation... so if you feel an awkward situation like you are awkwardly standing next to someone that you don't know, look at them in their eyes and ask ""what's your name"" AS CONFIDENTLY AS POSSIBLE! they will then tell you, and you just say your name in one word with a smile or some sort of facial expression to show that you can be friendly but still demand respect. Usually when introduce you shake hands so expect to do that almost every time. 

Questions that you need to memorize and you will be safe 
-""what's your name"" for introducing 

-""how do you guys know each other"" when you are talking to a group that you don't know well or just met
-""how do you know the birthday boy"" when talking to someone new

Just enjoy it"
soc_653861,socialskills,reddit_comment,411,"You can do it! It's definitely possible for you to make friends, and I think it's much more likely than not.

I understand that being 24 when some college freshmen are 18-20 feels like a big difference, but ultimately it'll only truly hold you back if you see your age as a flaw. If you go through your college years telling yourself you're weird and old, it'll be harder for you to be authentic and open - and that, in turn, might make it harder to form solid friendships.

Instead, consider that being a 24-year-old college student might actually be something positive, unique, and interesting about you! Personally, I would've loved to have a 24-year-old friend in college. You're still young and cool, but you've had more time to develop, so you're probably a little more mature and responsible than the average student. You're probably a bit more level-headed and have your priorities straight. Your friends may look up to you as someone who's wise and drama-free! As long as you don't habitually talk down to younger people, and just be your own lovable self, your age will be an asset.

Ultimately, you can't control how other people will feel about you. Maybe some people will be bothered by your age (though I can't imagine why anyone would be). Or maybe you just won't ""click."" If that's the case, you probably can't do anything to change their minds. Those aren't the friends you want. Find *your* crowd - people who appreciate *you* and want to be around *you,* and people you truly like being around. They exist. Even if it's lonely before you find a group that feels right, keep your chin up and don't be afraid to spend time alone with yourself.

What's much more likely to happen is that your classmates will just see your age as a fun, interesting fact about you - like being able to speak 4 languages, or having a talent for hula-hooping. And that's if they even notice or care. Most probably won't - I know I don't! I'm 26, some of my closest friends are in their 30s, and it doesn't even cross my mind most of the time. It's much more about compatibility and shared values than about a physical age. People can have so many things in common to bond about - age usually isn't even on the list. Don't sweat it, and in all likelihood, no one else will either."
soc_1837890,socialskills,reddit_comment,401,"You either lie to them or go out of your comfort zone, show confidence and tell them to stop overreacting and trust you and your decision.

Since you are just 18 and these are your parents, they will show resistance and it will cost you probably a lot of energy.

When I had to confront my parents to stop being over carrying, never letting me do something because ""I might do something wrong"", it was obviously not easy because this is what they conditioned themself and what was ""normal"" for them. This behavior leads me to lack taking responsibility and be overly fearing doing anything on my own without having anyone to give me the ""safety"".

It took tons of energy and work to get out of this, including open communication with my parents, telling them to stop being that overly protective and let me do my own experiences EVEN if this means that I will do something wrong and might ""burn my fingers"".

Even today they are like ""Double/Tripple check that you turn off the grill, the lights, the fridge, the oven,.."" and I have to stop them proactively like ""Hey, thank you but as I already said, it's okay. I am not stupid, it's not like I don't know this stuff. And if something happens on accident, it's called an accident with a reason because you do something wrong even if you know its wrong and even when someone told you to take care of it, so the only thing you do with this overprotective mode is to programming me into becoming insecure and losing responsibility, stop that please.""

For me, it took me like 26 years to stand up for myself because I didn't know it better. I thought there is nothing wrong with it until I learned how much it was harming me and my personality.

For your parents, you will always be their sweet little child which they have to protect and it's not always easy to get out of your bird's nest. But it\`s a necessary step to learning responsibility. This doesn't mean that you have to start a fight, just open communication for what you want and what not and that they please tolerate your decision. If you ever need help, you will ask them for help. And you might repeat this over and over until they finally let you do what you want."

4. Get all of those friends you just made into your phone, and ask them to hang out individually, then you just made yourself a group of great friends =o.

soc_83516,socialskills,reddit_comment,399,"Hey. I feel you man. Almost as if everyone on campus has banded up and become friends with each other and they're just not open for business anymore. If only you got there sooner. And if only something could fix the broken parts about you so that you'd be good enough to be friends with these people.

I can fix you!

I can tell you right now you're not as unfriendable as you think you are.   I'm going to tell you two things that you can do to turn this around. These are basic things that all those people in the clubs are doing that help them make friends. **If you follow this advice, I promise you'll be welcomed right in as a part of the group. If you don't, you'll just remain lonely - probably even more lonely as time goes on.**

First part: **Change how you speak to yourself**. I can tell by your script that you don't think very highly of yourself. I'll be you don't even blame your friends for ignoring you. Remember, you're an *amazing* dude. **Start speaking to and about yourself as if you were the person you most admire.** Love yourself. Acknowledge the parts that you love about yourself often. Several times a day.

**Everyone will follow your lead. Love yourself, think that you're the greatest - and everyone else will do the same.**

Second part: **Get into the habit of giving without asking for something back.** How would you feel about a total stranger who walks up to you, hands you $5 and walks away? How would you feel about a total stranger who gives a genuine compliment to you and walks away without expecting one back? How would you feel about a total stranger who sees you, smiles, and gives you a high five as you walk back?

Fucking awesome, right?

Get into the habit of saying ""hello"" to people, or smiling to them, or offering a compliment ""Hey, you should know that's a crazy nice shirt you're wearing."" or helping with them if they look like they're struggling with something. Paying for the coffee of the person behind you in line.

Just give away kindness constantly. Be constantly generous and ask for nothing back.

**A person who loves himself and is sincerely generous is insanely attractive. You will be claimed and invited everywhere. Everyone will love you.**

Good luck!"

Do you try improve yourself and **be the type of person people want to befriend?** Do you spend hours daily, learning social skills and applying them in real life? If you don't, then what the fuck are you complaining about... our problems are our own faults.

I feel you man, i've faced loneliness and even hopelessness. But you need to understand, this shit isn't easy. If it was, everybody would do it and loneliness wouldn't exist. You can either accept that and work hard, or be depressed and powerless. Start SIMPLE, and work your way up to a social master. I'm not going to tell you how, because we're all different. What worked for me might not work for you. But, we all want a fucking simple answer right? I never found what I needed though this subreddit, or even any part of reddit.

soc_959350,socialskills,reddit_comment,278,"Holy shit you're astute. THAT may actually be why people open up to you so quickly.

Well, I can't even express how much I understand your perspective and agree with all of your statements, especially your explanation of ""seen rather than connect"", and the emotional labor, and lack of boundaries.

The only thing I can offer is to suggest hardening your reception, which is cold and difficult for most people who've had their own traumatic experiences. Plain and simple, just don't be empathetic to their experiences. Hear them, respond, but just sort of block it. Don't let it influence your relationship with them in any way, except through the judgement calls you've made above.

""This person doesn't really care about a relationship with me at this time, they just want a emotional support human they can take on walks.""

You can continue to be cordial and hang out if you wish, just make a mental note that this relationship will probably be like your others... 80/20.

I'm not sure what age range you're in, but I can say I noticed a sizable drop in behaviors like this when I entered my 30s. Those in the early to mid 20s tend to be very ""this is the past that made me"" when in conversations, where the 30s seem to be more oriented away from the individual. 

However, you might be in your 30s and just have a completely different experience. Not sure where you are, but you seem like you'd be a cool person to chop it up with. I rarely meet people who have both deep introspection and the ability to communicate the experience to others. Super neat."
soc_1068394,socialskills,reddit_comment,562,"I can't speak for you, since I am not able to get inside your mind. Only you can figure out the answer to your question. And it might dawn on you one day, randomly.

That's what happened to me, I think... at least with one piece of the puzzle. Maybe you can relate to this, maybe not. Maybe it will help you find your answer, maybe it won't.

One day I was laying down, feeling anxiety about thinking about sending someone an email, a friend, someone who I really like. And I've had this feeling that they hate me for several months now (like 7 or 8 months). I moved away like 4, 5 months ago and I've been trying to keep in contact with my friends. For the most part, it's going well. But with this person, I always felt anxiety when typing an email. It took me 2 months to send the first email, and nerves really was the thing that impeded that. In total, I sent three emails but never got a reply. So perhaps it's true they dislike me now. But this isn't the only person I've felt this way toward (feeling like they hate me and it causing me to be nervous to contact them), I'm just using it as an example because it's the situation where something dawned on me.

So I was laying down, feeling nervous with the thought in my mind that I should send that email today. Like, click send already! And then randomly, a good memory of us comes to my head. And then I felt zero anxiety about sending that email for a few minutes... it was odd. Literally it was zero anxiety, zero nervousness. Of course it didn't last. The nerves were back by the time I got to my laptop.

But what dawned on me was, with this person, I was always thinking of the situations where I fucked up, where they got mad at me, and things like that. And I guess over the course of months and months of just being over-loaded with those bad memories, well damn they convinced my mind and emotions that they actually did hate me... and then my confidence around them dipped and I started acting different, I wasn't starting as much conversations... and then maybe that's what caused them to not like me anymore, if that's the current case.

So me? I found the answer to that question, but from my perspective. Is it the same for you? I dunno. Maybe. Maybe not.

As a climax... just a few days ago I thought of an idea or method I could use to combat this tendency of mine, and in fact maybe even have the opposite effect (meaning, tons of confidence with them!), and it is this: every time I have a good experience with someone (ie: laughter, affection, smiles, etc.), I need to write it down and accumulate long lists of these good experiences. Hopefully it has a positive effect for me and my mind. I just don't want to feel any more inferiority complexes to friends, or feel like they hate me. Cause shit, feeling like someone hated me even tho they didn't hurt that relationship. And it sucks that it happened. I'm bummed out by it. So, I gotta prevent anything like that from happening in the future again."

soc_1700136,socialskills,reddit_comment,673,"People are good or bad regardless of gender.

However, I worked in an all female office 5 years ago and this particular group of women were  just awful, awful people. Jealous, back stabbing, gossipy, nosey,  you name it.

Just keep things professional and respectful and if these women are decent people they will eventually open up to you and respect you. However if you end up in a situation like mine, here are some things I did to keep myself sane. I admit some of these are borderline unethical, but they worked:

1. Stay busy and focused on your job. Be good at what you do. At one point, my group of coworkers (including my manager) complained that I made them ""look bad"" in comparison. Be outwardly sympathetic and understanding to them to keep them off your back, but deep down laugh, ignore their bullshit, and keep kicking ass. The right people will eventually notice and want you on their team. Worse case scenario, your clients will notice and this will open up job opportunities elsewhere.
2. Don't open up about your life right away and get to know people slowly. Keep all social media private and don't list your employer anywhere on your social media. Spell your name different if you want (I don't do this personally). Slightly obscure your profile pictures so people can't tell it's you. This way, you can claim your Facebook profile is a ""different person"" if people try to add you or get you in trouble for it. I had a situation where one of my co-workers stalked my Facebook profile using a mutual friend's profile and tried to get me in trouble for a joke I made on my Facebook profile. When confronted at work, I just said ""that's not me, I don't have a Facebook"". Since my profile picture didn't clearly show my face, list my employer, or anything else related to my job, it worked.
3. If your coworkers are toxic, be boring. Don't get jealous. Be professional. Don't worry or care about what they think. If they're nosey, Make up boring hobbies for them to gossip about. My co workers tried to have ""team building"" activities every week. I was originally excluded from all of these, and they did everything they could to rub it in. However, once they realized I didn't get jealous about getting ignored (a good way to deal with workplace ostracism btw), they did everything they could to get me out. I made up some shit about being a chess moderator in a town an hour away, and after that they stopped inviting me again. They would gossip about this, which would crack me up and made the days more fun for me personally. So I started making up other boring hobbies (like speed knitting) and amusing myself with their rumors. It got me through the time I had to be there. Plus it helped keep my work life and real life separate as I'm sure they couldn't find anyone with my name and speed knitting/chess moderating online, lol.
4. If your manager is also awful, save and copy client/customer testimonials(obviously obscure their names for privacy) for your next job. I was awarded employee of the month by my companies HR department for going above and beyond on a project, and I made sure to save their emails and my certificate and print them off for myself ""to hang up on my refrigerator at home (lmao)"". If your manager is awful, you can use these towards getting another job.

Long story short, you're there to work. If your co-workers suck, see them for who they are, and keep your interactions polite and job related. Keep social media private and get to know people slowly. Don't worry or give a fuck about what these people think if they turn out to be shitty.  If your manager sucks, use client/customer testimonials to build your reputation and to land a better job.

Ok, reset... or hey holy shit that stranger either smiled back didnt say anything, or said hello back and kept moving... thats cool, making progress... your goal is to get someone to stop.. ask them for directions to some place.. even if you been there a thousand times.. get absolutely clear directions.. so do I make a left or a right on main... ok, Thank you. Move the fuck on. Congrats, more progress... see? Theres a chick.. holy shit balls is she hot... same casual conversation.. add a little flavor to it.. a compliment. Smile.. at anytime, you start to wigg out.. break rapport and move on. Sooner or later.. guess what.. you WILL score a girl, a phone number, even get laid... NATURALLY. Thats how its done, son. Not  swirly lines of bullshit... PRACTICE. Now you were talking about having problems talking to bros... its same goddamn thing just dont amp up on a gay vibe. Im sure you might cross path a fruit once or twice in saying hello.. but thats easy, be nice cut rapport or make a new friend - thats up to you.   "
soc_1290040,socialskills,reddit_comment,102,"Beat advice I was ever given - 

Someone else’s opinion of you is none of your damn business.  

It sounds harsh, but think about it.  The only person you can really compete or compare yourself to is you. 

Everyone is different.  You can’t measure someone’s accomplishments if you don’t know everything about them.  

Maybe those girls have serious self esteem issues and are lashing out.   It doesn’t mean they aren’t mean or rude af. But it does mean that their opinion is flawed.  So why trust them?  Water off a ducks back.  

You are worth far more than someone’s opinion of you."
soc_918132,socialskills,reddit_comment,332,"First off, find a hobby. Find topics that you are willing to discuss, like a debate-y discussion, because those tend to compel people to reply. I talk about history and current events with people, and usually they move on to different topics. Don't force your opinions on them, take a passive approach to answers: ""Yea, I find tiktok kinda dumb tbh, but that's just my opinion. Some people do make genuinely interesting content"" instead of ""Oh fuck tiktok, that thing's shit and only used by people without brain cells""

Another pointer is to stop talking too much. I have a friend who drones on and on about topics, even when people aren't listening, and people don't really like him for that (they find him too chatty). Most people don't tell him to shut up because they're being polite (I'm one of those who actually tells him to shut it because it interrupts my inner voice). Instead, throw out random opinions every once in a while. Stuff like ""Have you noticed that despite being right handed, some people use their left hand for spoons?"" or something like that. It gets them to think, breaks the ice, and helps them talk to you easier.

Last but not least, try to find your own identity. People do get girls by trying to be what girls like, but not many people keep them. Find your niche (maybe you're a car junkie, history buff, crazy smart about human behaviour), and naturally you'll find people who are more interesting tan the average narcissistic basic guy/girl. For example, I'm that one guy who carries a camera 24/7, will stand in a field at noon if I find a plane flying, or completely shut everyone up just to hear a nice car/plane drive/fly by. Most of my friends tend to be interested in photography, planes, cars, or more.

Also an addition, I'm 20 and I've not actually had a girlfriend, though a girl was crushing on me a while back."
soc_931527,socialskills,reddit_comment,161,"To me this sounds like typical adolescent/young adult humour, and a lot of the time this is coloured by insecurity. On some level making fun of others validates/elevates their sense of self.  So yes, they are most likely trying to be funny, in the manner they are capable. However, this doesn’t make fun had at the expense of another alright. It’s hurtful and unnecessary. Now how you move forward from here is entirely up to you. As I see it, you either allow it to slide this time, and risk it happening again, or you communicate your experience of this. If they truly are your friends that should be the end of it. 

If you choose to communicate how you feel, i’d recommend that you emphasise how you experienced the situation. Rather than what was done. Your experience of life will always be valid as such. No one can take that away from you, or dispute your take on a situation."
soc_140786,socialskills,reddit_comment,219,"Hey now, there's a line of thought I've struggled with recently.

You feel stuck, nowhere to turn, don't know what to do.  I'm not gonna tell you something stupid like ""this is only temporary"" or ""It gets better"" because that's not what you need to hear right now.  You just want a freind, someone who will listen to you, and someone who cares about what happens to you.  There's *nothing* wrong with that and don't let anyone tell you differently.

You're posting to this sub so I'm guessing you're at leasing hoping to find a little advice.  So I have two recommendations to you: 

* First, breathe.  Whenever you start to feel lonely or depressed just focus on your breathing. Long slow breaths in and out from your belly (not from your chest mind you)
* Second, start changing small things here and there in your life. Do you always sit in the same seat? Sit somewhere different.  Do you always walk the same path to school? Take a different path.  Small changes.  Your current situation isn't working for you OP.  Change something, because I guarantee you that no one else is going to change it for you.

While these steps might not sound like a solution to your problem, try them.  Something in your life might just change."
soc_49972,socialskills,reddit_comment,243,"I'm not sure what your social skills are like, but I can tell your attitude can use adjustment. I've had the same feeling for a long time. I wouldn't text even the friends I did know very well because I thought I would come off as clingy. I was afraid they would reject me because we hung out the day before, and they would think I was too clingy.

It's time to make adjustments to your attitude. Everyone wants friends. Ask anyone. Do I want friends? Hell yes! One thing I learned from reading this subreddit and talking to people is that they don't think about that stuff as much as you think. Keep making conversation with the person. He might warm up to you. If he doesn't, no harm done. He's not going around to other people talking about how needy you are. The thing is that there is nothing wrong with wanting to hang out with someone or talk to someone. In some countries, people go out of their way to talk to others *cough* Canada *cough*. You need to believe that what you are doing is perfectly acceptable. You need to be prepared to reply to ""What is wrong with you?"" with ""What is wrong with me? What is wrong with you?"" You are not violating a social etiquette. They are. Your goal is to be friendly, and if they are cold and distant, they are the ones being weird."

This is what self-hatred feels like, and it's the sort of thing you need to go out of your way to make time to change, because nobody will ever convince you that your identity is wrong, they can only offer 100% honest accurate information that is counter to your self-perception, and alternate life perspectives. 

Because ""ego"" is just your identity/worldview, it doesn't strictly mean excessive self-confidence,  you can have an ego/identity around being the only logical &amp; sane person in the room because you're the only one who can see the terrible things about yourself.

soc_322476,socialskills,reddit_comment,688,"Hey congratulations on getting to med school! That takes a lot of work and dedication, more than I can do haha

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, I'm also in college, and I'm still struggling with a lot of this stuff myself but here's what I have to share from my experience:

I think the intimidating look thing only matters when people want to initiate conversations with you, which you mentioned people already do anyways so it's probably not a big deal. Furthermore, you seem like a nice guy from this post, so if you start the conversations yourself then people will realize that fact pretty quickly and it won't matter to them how you look
    
As for the fear of opening up, I have the same problem too. I often subconsciously hide my opinions or stories either because I'm afraid of being shot down or for some other reason I don't know yet, but I've found two ways to get around it and get closer to people: the cheating way, or the real way. I'm currently doing the cheating way, and trying to work towards doing the real way (but it's hard work!)

&amp;nbsp;

The 'cheating' (but still very good) way is to get close to people by getting them to open up to you through being genuinely interested in them. I think you already do this, which is how you've gotten your current friends, but you'd be surprised how open people are to sharing themselves with you if you let them feel comfortable and you're able to relate to them. And by sharing their story with you, they trust you more, which means they share more, and so on. You can steer the conversation towards deeper topics, such as their concerns, motivations, and really getting in touch with their feelings. When you develop a closer relationship you'll hopefully feel more comfortable opening up to them in return.
   
Of course, being genuinely invested in their well being and genuinely interested in them as a person are requirements for this. If you're bored of them, they'll know and it won't go anywhere. This works a lot of the time, but sometimes they're just uncomfortable or having a bad day and you should prooobably leave them alone.  I had a friend who always and only talked about work whenever I saw him, and whenever I got him to share anything, he always sounded like he was writing a research paper about himself. We didn't get very close but what can ya do right?

&amp;nbsp;

I've made a lot of close friends this way, not intentionally, but as a byproduct of being curious about different people. The reason I call it the cheating way though is because in the end I never really put myself out there; I never risked anything at all because if they didn't like me I could feel like it wasn't something wrong with me because I didn't share. In fact a lot of my friends still say that they don't know anything about me because I often play my cards too close to my chest. I can tell this bothers them and probably prevents my friendships from getting as close as they could be. 
     
The real way, in my opinion, and from a lot of reading, is to do the above but also equally share yourself without being afraid of being judged. If you truly love yourself unconditionally, and are comfortable with who you are and what your values are, then how others receive you won't affect how you see yourself; your sense of identity (whether positively or negatively). And if you don't feel personally attacked when other people reject you, then you have nothing to be afraid of when you share. Again, easier said than done and I certainly still feel crappy when people don't want to talk to me or would rather hang out with other people, but it's certainly worth trying to achieve this ""self-actualization"" IMO
     
Sorry for the wall of text, I have no idea how to format reddit posts, and in a way writing this out made me feel better too. Hope this helps!"
soc_344607,socialskills,reddit_comment,275,"Try out some ""positive imaging"" that people like Norman Vincent Peale wrote about.  Rather than seeing yourself as the person who ""can't make one close friend"" and whose ""close friends drift away"" and is left ""lonely,"" you can choose to start seeing yourself as the person ""who makes friends easily"" and ""keeps in contact with friends"" and feels comfortable and confident.  Trust someone speaking from experience here...others are repelled by a poor, lonely, friendless me.  The good news is you can shake off that image...you just gotta work on your self-talk...then you'll start walking in a different way, and people will notice.  You can turn this around, even in h.s.  Think of it like this, perhaps...would you want a friend who constantly came up to you and said, ""You don't have any close friends and you aren't gonna make any.  People won't stick around for you.  You're just gonna end up lonely...etc.?""  Of course not...a real friend wouldn't talk to you like that.  So why would you talk to yourself that way?  Think about it.  Start by being the kind of friend to yourself that you would want...then start using that to be the kind of friend to others that you would want for yourself.  Remember that you can't make other people like you.  They have free will, too.  What you can do is to work on yourself and become as likable a person as you can be, so people who appreciate someone so nice will recognize those qualities in you.  Get that image of yourself in your mind as soon as you can.  Thoughts become words become actions become habits become character become destiny. "

Ending a situation on a polite but firm note is key and doing that face to face while maintaining a serious stance will further accentuate your position, keeping in mind that the suggestion I have given is up to OP's own personal choice.

soc_1760653,socialskills,reddit_comment,393,"I was head of security at one of the largest strip club chains in the NC, SC, and GA areas. I've met more women doing that job than most will in five lifetimes. I was engaged to a beautiful talented woman. We only split because my mother got sick and I had to move. She couldn't due to her son. Which I highly respected and completely understood. We're still friends to this day. Anyway, I've had countless conversations with dancers. I bet out of 1,000 dancers only 10 of them are airheads with no life goals. I've had conversations with some that travel all over the US dancing at different places. When I was younger I had the basic mentality as most do. ""Strippers are hoes who sleep with everyone and do drugs."" In all actuality, it's the complete opposite. Yes, society has its views and opinions when it comes to that profession. I've seen the damage, bruises, and verbal abuse these ladies go through during one shift. I bet most grown men couldn't handle one shift in these ladies' positions. As I was saying that almost all of them have goals that they are trying to achieve. These women aren't emotionally attached or in any way emotionally involved in their work. It's nothing but a job that they are extremely talented at doing. I'm not saying there are the few who give these women a bad name but that's in every aspect of life. If she's even opening up to you, making you feel secure, going above and beyond, and being fully honest and open with you. That alone says more on her part than you could ever imagine my man. The worst thing you can do is attempt to put her on a timeline, or even question her loyalty. You need to step back and trust her dude. If you love her as you claim you need to trust her and let her do what she's going to do. Even if she's 90 years old and in a wheelchair rolling across that stage. Let it be. It's her job nothing more. Now if she gives you a valid reason then you can approach it with caution. If you even attempt to show distrust or question her you'll lose her faster than you can come up with an excuse or a reason."
soc_1678239,socialskills,reddit_comment,777,"So much to unpack here. First, you're not the only one. LOTS of people are in this position. It's because they also may be ""bland"" (will get to that in a sec) and don't know how to make friends. It's a VERY common problem.

Re: getting out of your comfort zone, yes, that needs to be done. But not until you fix the social aspects that are necessary in order to connect with people. Repeatedly getting out of your comfort zone will only result in repeated failures unless you address that issue. (It's still good that you've tried, though, so kudos to you for making the effort!) 

Okay, about the whole ""bland"" thing. I have two big thoughts on that. One is that everyone has a choice as to who they'll hang out with, or spend more time with. Why would they choose BLAND? In fact, why would YOU choose bland? Why would any of us? We don't normally choose tasteless food. Why would we do that when it comes to personality?

Okay, that isn't supposed to be depressing, it's supposed to give you some perspective as to WHY this is happening. The good news is, 'bland' can be fixed. Although it's MUCH harder to fix if you adopt it as an Integral Personality Trait that you're willing to die with. I see absolutely no reason to do that, though. 

Bland is what you get when you haven't broken through the confidence barrier, and you haven't lit the fires of your own passions. These are things that can and SHOULD be done if you want to live your best life. 

The reason to do it is for YOUSELF, not for others! My first goal is always to be interesting to myself, to be entertaining to myself, to be likeable to MYSELF. Then and only then can I bring that to other people, and at that point it won't even be difficult, it'll flow naturally.

Sometimes we get so stuck in not drawing attention to ourselves that we don't even realize the automatic things we do to remain hidden. We do things like: not speak up, not make waves, don't raise our voice, don't make that comment, don't attempt something new, don't say anything to the teacher we like, don't light up a big smile, don't show warmth. So many DON'TS! And we do all this without even thinking about it. We retreat behind the Invisible Barrier that protects us from any potential criticism, any unwanted attention, any embarrassing moment. 

Boring is more a state of mind than an aspect of a particular club. Sure, the group itself could be low-key. (Bland? Hmm. Bland.) To me that is an OPPORTUNITY to light things up! To start kidding around with people. To test out some fun remarks. To start greeting people and getting to know them in a major way. Because hey, if the group is BORING, the stage is set for anyone to step in there and make things interesting. (see: 'self-entertainment') 

Life isn't about waiting around for someone else to show some passion, to show some enthusiasm, to inject a little energy into things. ANY of us can do that. You just need to generate a little excitement about life and what you're doing here. 

Note: this doesn't mean you have to be loud, or crazy, or disruptive. But a certain amount of 'social energy' is absolutely necessary to keep things from being bland or boring. 

We don't talk to our dogs or cats in a bland tone. Why do we do it with people?

Anyway, my point is, you have to develop some passion for: yourself, other people, and LIFE ITSELF to transform your future from one of bland boringness to one of playfulness, positivity and potential. 

Bland is the mask, it's the pool cover that hides what could be an awesome party with beach balls, pool floats, poolside beverages, water volleyball. Picture the difference between a covered pool and a rocking pool party.

That's the difference between 'bland' and cultivating some passion in your life.

The other aspect, 'confidence,' comes from learning to be comfortable expressing all of that. And that comes from practice, a little bit at a time. One person here. Another conversation there. If you're talking to someone, do it with some energy, with a smile as you greet them, with a playful word. With the enthusiasm you'd show for a dog or cat. Or a celebrity. In the movie that is your life, YOU are the celebrity. Start visualizing that role and what you want it to look like. Everyone is different, but no one needs to be bland.

Good luck!"
soc_1158594,socialskills,reddit_comment,214,"Hey there! 

I want you to know you are not alone! In fact lot of adults from 25 onwards struggle making friends because we loose so many connected engagements. 

I think start small and build up. Particularly if you have anxiety it is hard to meet people because of a fear of missing out or being rejected. 

Think if the activities you enjoy doing at home. Maybe you are really into drawing so maybe joining a life drawing class might be an option to meet people with similar interests. Or if you have work you can do maybe go to a cafe and work for an hour or so. Most likely nobody will come up to you but it’s more about building your confidence in showing you in the outside world rather than staying indoors. 

You could even start by joining some clubs or whatever once you build yourself up. At the end of the day dealing with mental health and building friendships is not a goal moving from one point to another 📈 but rather it’s about learning the tools to cope and know when to push and pull back. 

I hope this helps. I know how hard it is to feel that lonely it’s honestly soul crushing. It can get better ❤️"
soc_1164761,socialskills,reddit_comment,584,"Everyone is different and with that comes differing needs. A person may go from person to person for comfort, for validation, for having someone to share experiences with, for fiscal reasons, for fun, or any other reason. There might be some past experience which has led them to do this. Equally, they may just enjoy it. It’s not always about ‘depending’ on someone else. I’ve known very successful (in career) people who have done this, and others who are not financially as successful but just like being around new people. 

I have 3 daughters in my life, the middle being 15. What I have noticed with her is the constant need for validation due to the social media lifestyle. That validation comes in the form of attention and whichever boy is paying the most attention, plays on the ‘victim’ status she portrays (usually bullshit) and tells her she great / pretty the most is the one she’s going out with. She will go from one to the next with no down time. There is a distinct lack of self-confidence, horrendous mood swings with poor shows of depression and misery (all fake because it’s designed to get the attention back on her - we know this because she is fine with us and family. Yes we check her phone almost nightly, so we see this crap) and ability to keep her face out of her screen, all driven by the social media obsession that a lot of these kids have now. I think that requirement for validation sticks around into early adulthood, and a side effect could well be the jumping about from person to person. 

The older daughter who is 20 is nothing like that. Although it has been about for her younger years, she doesn’t care for social media and has been with her boyfriend for about 3 years. Is confident, stable and happy. Doesn’t play the woe-betide-me card ever. 

As I say, different people, different needs and different ways of seeking resolution to those needs. It’s not wrong to jump from person to person. Personally, I don’t think it’s that healthy for those that do not, and ends up creating more issues than it solves, but it’s kinda down to them. Best anyone can do for them is to be there and offer help if needed. If you see obvious sign of mental well-being declining, seek professional help with them.

I do think a lot of the modern day person to person jumping is a result of social media with people gravitating towards whoever gives them the most attention at any given time. Sure it’s always happened, but it was harder to do when I was a teen in the 90s because you had to work hard and well to get an actual persons attention who was there in front of you. Doing it all on a screen with no physical social interaction makes the whole thing much more accessible and easier. Kids are way more desperate for attention now as on social media, everyone is shouting about themselves thinking everyone else is listening. The problem is, when everyone is shouting about themselves, the noise gets to be a lot, so people have to shout even louder to stand out. That’s when we see people going to extremes and making up bullshit to appear exciting or different or in need. And so here we are. Now we have Poe Poe who will latch on to any person that gives them that attention."
soc_1563389,socialskills,reddit_comment,224,"One thing you can try in the future is when you first start working with someone new, let them know that you are working on some soft skills, but that you struggle sometimes with reading cues (and/or whatever you think was the problem working with these folks). Give them permission to give you feedback, or speak to you more bluntly. And it will make it easier for you to hear the feedback without taking it personally. In other words, it will help you both focus on the behavior rather than the person. We all have our personality challenges, after all, it's just that some of them affect the way we work together and some don't.

I once worked with a guy who told me in our first meeting that he was on the spectrum and struggled with social cues sometimes. This gave me permission to be more up front when he wasn't taking hints that other folks would normally pick up on easily. We had very interesting and productive conversations about it. I had a lot of respect for him for doing that.

Edit: I just saw your comment about you being a supervisor. All the more reason to be up front---this sets the stage for open communication, and makes your employees feel more comfortable sharing the things they are working on with you."
soc_1122084,socialskills,reddit_comment,167,"People don't say it directly because it hurts people's feelings. You don't care, but THEY have no way of knowing that.

And believe me, if they've said they can't three times, and have NEVER suggested, ""oh hey I'm sorry I can't, but maybe we can do it next week"" (or whatever) they are definitely not interested. 

That's like the people who say, ""why don't people just TELL ME why they don't want me as a friend."" Because it's hurtful, besides being awkward and uncomfortable. So people are just busy.

In my case I have known them, not in-depth but I used to talk with one of them from time to time, like once every two months or so, and I was generally aware of the other person's existence.

For me, I think they took me in pretty well, it took a little adjustment in the beginning but they are good people and now I would call them friends.

Be okay with the outcome, whatever it might be, be genuine and be interested in them as a person. It helps if you find out you have common interests but it's not a necessity either. Try to be yourself is as trash overused advice as advice gets but it really helps. 

Don't rush anything and don't get worried if it's just a bit uncomfortable in the beginning, sometimes people take time to warm up to eachother. 

You might find out you don't click, if so, don't worry, it's not a fault of yours, or anyone else's. If so, don't be afraid to try to move or find other accommodation, been there, done that. Not the end of the world either.

soc_425161,socialskills,reddit_comment,328,"I think the best thing to do in public is just be warm and casual, and then find a time to talk privately with him about what happened. To tell him that yes, you did notice, and you’re sorry for how you may have reacted when you did. Ask him if he’s comfortable talking about it. Be open and listen, and do your best to make him feel accepted, and like he doesn’t have to hide his hand behind tape, or not gesture with it when he speaks so that people don’t notice.

I am sure that every day of his life someone notices and that he can feel how he makes people uncomfortable. How would you feel if a physical trait of yours did that to others? What would you want someone to say to you? How would you hope others reacted? You can’t always control your gut instinct. You can control what you do later on.

The both of you are young, and in high school it can be difficult for anyone to feel like they fit in. I’m sure he takes notice of people gawking often, and if he decided to hide his hand after you did, I can guess he may feel badly about it. If the two of you were able to connect on a personal level already, consider going out of your way to make sure he knows he has a friend. You don’t have to force a friendship out of guilt, but there was already a connection there - it shouldn’t be too hard to make an effort to get to know the guy.

Even if that conversation you guys have doesn’t turn into a hallmark moment and build a great friendship- even if he doesn’t decide to open up to you when you ask him about it.. Someone reaching out in a kind, open, nonjudgmental way can make a difference. Tiny interactions that show empathy and kindness *can* really matter.

I had an ex who did this but she wouldn’t text back daily and we were talking about heavy stuff so I just moved on from the convo and cut contact, but left an open window."

My lady friends(mostly around 23-27) always tell me ""hey Alex your nice funny and pretty handsome, why don't you have a girlfriend?"" I usually reply with a ""I'm still searching"" or ""I haven't found anyone that interest me"" but honestly I think my problem is that I need to get out more since right now I only really have time to work and sleep so I don't get out much and most of the chicks at where I work are either married or in  a serious relationship, but I'm gonna start going to college in the fall so hopefully I meet a lot of interesting people. "
soc_964137,socialskills,reddit_comment,1332,"That's a whole other discussion. If I had to account for every contingency, I'd have to write 1000 pages because there's just too many exceptions and contexts needed. This will be long, and I think it'll be a great way to refresh on some ideas in my head. So brace up.

So when talking to people there's something called a frame. It's how you view the world. For example, two people see a cup with water in it, and one person sees it as half-full, while the other sees it as half-empty. Each have their own rationalizations for why they see it that way. 

At the end of the day, neither is more right or wrong, because everything is technically subjective. It's just a cup with water. Our view of it is whatever meaning we attach to it, based off of our life experiences and emotional state. But, one way of seeing it might be more beneficial to someone than the other.

Stick with me, because this important. When you see the world through a certain frame, and something comes into your life that disrupts your frame of how you see the world and disproves it or makes it not so black-and-white, it's a double-edged sword. The reason is because you might gain a new perspective that helps you in how you go about your life or in seeing things in a new light, but the cost is a feeling of confusion, a muddied sense of self, and difficulty in progressing your life. It's enlightening, but it's not fun. You're also always in ""loading mode"". Never committed or on a mission.

Additionally, when you have no mission, have no strong opinions, and lack a solid world-view, you will always be a target for others to give you their world-view to suit their needs. It's literally what manipulators do. Gas-lighting, for example. The goal is to make a person lose their frame and lose trust for how they perceive reality, so that the manipulator can then feed them with their own view of reality, in a way that benefits them. Lack a frame, and others will tell you the frame. And there's more nuances, like don't be a weirdo who tries to get people to lose frame as some weird ""power move"". Frame should only be for you to have a solid reality.  

You will find that a lot of people with a strong sense of self and frame of reality tend to be VERY high in conviction, but also ignorant in certain aspects. Not always, but if they are open to new perspectives, it takes a WHILE for it to integrate, and sometimes, they may remain ignorant on a topic for the rest of their lives, unless they experience something life-changing, or their needs are no longer being met and they need that knowledge. In some ways though, it's a necessary blind-spot in order to have a solid frame of reality to speak from because without it, you're easily going to be manipulated.

People who have a strong sense of self AND are genuinely open-minded (I'm not talking about the ones who can fake it), are very rare. This requires the ability to commit, while also having a strong desire for knowledge. And if the only benefit is knowledge, and there's no tangible reward for the person, most people aren't going to go out of their way to seek it if their needs are being met.

As a side note, how you can hold frame is by having a goal for yourself and how you want to live and what you want to do based off of how you view the world, and then to follow through on it regardless, outside of extreme scenarios. 

A great simple example of the concept of holding frame is going to the grocery store. You know that you want to eat healthy because you value health and you think it's important to live until old age. That's your frame. But then, as soon as you walk into the grocery store, you smell the food, and you see all the junk food, and you think, ""damn this is on discount! I'm getting it. Health can be figured out, I just need to enjoy myself. I'm the exception to the rule, it won't damage me much."". Then you go home with $50 worth of junk food that you initially didn't plan for because you lost frame. Holding frame would be to go in with an ingredient list of healthy food, and then only buying within that ingredient list.  

All of this was basically to say that it's tough. People who are open-minded tend to find it hard to be committed. People who are committed tend to find it hard to be open-minded. There are definitely exceptions, but a lot of people learn how to act like they have the opposite trait even when they don't. For example, someone who's committed might act like they're open-minded to what you're saying, but they'll likely continue doing what they're doing until they crash, a need is no longer being met, or life throws a curve-ball at them. And people who are too open-minded either find someone committed to latch onto, or fake being on a mission. 

I haven't been able to find people who can genuinely be open-minded and committed in a non-theoretical and genuinely actionable way. I'd be curious to see if others have easier ways of doing this.

I've made my own way though, and I'll share it in case it might help you. What I do is I hold frame for 10 months in a year (besides extreme things that need me to adapt), and then for 1-3 months every year, I go into ""open-minded"" mode and analyze the past year, along with my mistakes, my negative patterns, and the suggestions that people gave me. It's my most vulnerable period in the year. 

The way I do this is by writing daily in a journal about what advice people give me without using it or questioning it (outside of extreme and immediate and obvious cases, like slapping someone when angry and being scolded for it, for example, which is uncommon and something I personally would never do, but if somehow that happens, it's an obvious thing to never do again). Otherwise, I just note down how I feel, what others tell me, my experiences, how others react to me, and what I'm thinking about. 

Then, I live my life according to the goals, views, and missions I set for myself at the beginning of the year (I do this in the summer, rather than in January, personally), and then hold that world-view for dear life. I don't have an ego about it, or become reactive if someone questions it, but I just note down what they say without reflecting on it until the 10 months is over. I ""hold frame"". It's a necessary evil to live in that delusion if you want to get things done in life, in my POV. 

After the period is over, I look back at my experiences in my journal and start to scrutinize myself, and do insane research. I'll go insane lengths because I love learning new things. I'll talk to family I can trust for advice, I'll do research online, I'll find a bunch experienced mentors who can give advice (not those paid scammy ones, but just people with life experience, who I've vetted as trust-worthy) etc. The list goes on. I'll make sure to think critically and figure out the big picture of my experiences and why certain things ended up how they did.  I've done this for one year so far, and I grew faster than I've grown for the past 5 years of my life. No exaggeration. 

I wrote a lot, so the decency thing, I'll likely leave it for another day because it takes turning intuitive info into rational and shareable and useable info. Hopefully this helped!"

Trust me, Im speaking from experience here. If she really wanted you she wouldnt be taking so long to respond to your texts. Ask yourself this, if someone who you were interested in texted you, would you wait several hours to respond?

You need to decide for yourself if you like her or even if you just want to be friends, and then take action. Texting her didn’t seem to work so try calling or approaching her in person."
soc_574845,socialskills,reddit_comment,599,"That's absolutely me. It feels like an endless struggle. Like when you hold your stomach when someone is taking a picture of you; you can do it a while, yes, but it doesn't feel nice, you can NOT do it forever and eventually you stop faking it and you reveal your belly.  


I have two friends which I can ""be myself"". It's nice speaking with them, we all have a real dark sense of humor... The problem it's that they are social, they both have girlfriends and their own group of friends besides ours. So, I tend to be kind of dependent towards them. I ""need"" them more than what they need of me. And besides that, when they have any social meeting, party or something like that, I'm just a heavy load. I will only speak fluently with them, my conversation won't never be fulfilling with their friends or other people. That completely sucks.   


Two years ago one of my friends introduced me her cousin. She was a nice girl, and as he stated, she was kind of interested in meeting me. He gave me her number. I could not trully believe that she was interested on me, but anyhow we started talking sometimes. My friends pushed me to asking to meet someday to have a beer or something but I was so pesimistic and wary that I never asked it. We chatted somedays until I stopped answering her. Perhaps the 95% of population would enjoy that; a friend introduces you his nice cousin, so where's the problem? But I never felt nice with it, perhaps it was the fear of failing or dissapointing the girl, but what was clear of that situation was that I never enjoyed speaking with a nice new person at any point. A few weeks ago I joined Tinder as my friends suggested me, and the same thing happened to me. Started chatting with a nice girl and eventually I just dissapeared.  


If I make a huge effort, if I fake what I am, I think I can be nice or even interesting for some people. But it feels wrong, I only can fake that I am a different person until certain point, in which I can not deal with it anymore and I tend to scape.   


My mother told me once that my issue is that I am a demanding person. That I'm hard to please and I expect too much from everyone, that kind of guy that always look over his shoulder to people. But I don't feel like that. More like the opposite. My self esteem it's usually pretty low, and I never felt ""better"" than the cousin of my friends, the girl of Tinder or any of those guys I see at my work and I avoid befriending with them. In fact, I'm aware that I'm lonely, weird and sad and they don't look like that.  


It's not about having too huge expectations on the people I met, it's that I do not enjoy meeting new people. But at the same time, I can not stand being lonely. My friends can more or less stand how I am, it's not that I ""demand"" people being like they are.  


I know that I have to work on being more social, having a bigger group of friends to being able to enjoy my life - I'm not enjoying it being as lonely as I am now. But on the same time, when I make that effort that you describe... I just can't stand that struggle, if that makes sense at all. "
soc_518238,socialskills,reddit_comment,153,"Honestly, it depends on your own sense of humor. What's the sort of stuff you find funny? Dry humor, absurd humor, observational humor, offensive humor, slapstick/physical humor? (And whichever other varieties there are.) It's such a subjective thing - all I'll say is basically indulge yourself in the sort of stuff that amuses you, and let your own personal sense of humor develop from there. Not saying to steal jokes, per se, just figure out what works for you (you obviously don't have to stick to one type of humor, either).

From there, I think you can learn to pick out sources of humor in the various things around you, it just may take time. Just don't think you have to be funny on demand, like that ""Oh, you're a clownfish?! Hey, tell a joke!"" stuff from Finding Nemo - you're not a performing seal. Or a clownfish (as far as I know)."
soc_686241,socialskills,reddit_comment,348,"I’ve been in the food and beverage industry for almost a decade now. Worked with a lot of bartenders. And a lot of them are grouchy, because they baby sit alcoholics. So. With that said, you don’t necessarily have a super high bar to begin with. You hear more about shitty servers than a shitty bartender. 

But for starters, just “hey how’s it going.” “How’s your night/day going” “did you do anything interesting today”. “What’s new?” If it’s a reoccurring customer. And if they want to engage in conversation they’ll open up to you. At that point you can ask questions or share your own experience to further the conversation. When dropping off their orders you can say, “here’s your (item name), enjoy. Let me know if you need anything”. And then if you wanna go the extra mile, I do one or two table touches before the end, ”still doing ok?” “anything else I can get you?” This is gonna also help you upsell and make you more tipsssss. Then check drop off. 

If they don’t want to engage in conversation they’ll give you a short answer or won’t answer at all. Bartenders can be a therapist or just a source of alcohol to people. Depends what your setting is. 

I don’t really see a place where/when you need to be assertive. If you need to cut someone off, just stop making drinks. I’m from the US and we have alcohol laws here where the bar can be liable if they give too many drinks to the customer and they cause an accident in result of it. (Crazy right) but even in the eyes of the law it’s your “responsibility” and right to make a judgment call. If it gets bad you can call your manager or local law enforcement.

I’m sure if you do it regularly, you’ll find your groove and your spiel. I know some people in the customer service industry who say the same shit every time but they sound so fucking genuine it gets them every time. Fake it till you make it."
soc_1825522,socialskills,reddit_comment,207,"Some of this has could have to do with how you carry yourself, and even other qualities such as lack of natural charisma or unattractive/unkempt appearance.

Beyond that, the reasons behind why some people have no patience for you (or are doing this on purpose to make you feel bad), could be because

solution: escalate the relationship eg. ask him to coffee. he should get the cue and should from then on if he is interested.

2. Guy really sees you as buddy.
solution: your pool is not large enough. Go meet some other guys. FLIRT. Show your attractiveness eg don't swear too often (or speak like a guy), act feminine etc.

3. You are oblivious.
solution: Learn the subtle cues from guys when they show interests. The shy ones don't really come up to you and say they think you are cute and ask for your number and kiss close. You have to sometimes initiate if you see an opportunity.

My My brother has a lot of the same experiences as you And has always had difficulty maintaining close relationships outside a family. We all wish in urge him to go to a psychologist or psychiatrist whoever does the diagnosis because it would be helpful for not only him and identifying and naming what is going on but also for the rest of us and remembering that his experience is filtered through a unique lens. I would say having a formal diagnosis would’ve helped him in many ways not only with her familiar relationships in remembering and naming the condition but also with his work situation he has never been able to hold down a good job for a reason similar to those inefficiencies recognizing implied communication.

Lastly often times people jokes are simply not funny and it’s not always easy recognizing when they are intended to be funny.

soc_804325,socialskills,reddit_comment,216,"As someone who's been the one copying others, I can tell you that that behaviour is most likely subconscious and he doesn't even realise he's doing it until it's pointed out to him, and even then it sometimes just isn't enough to know that you're doing it to quit it. I understand that it makes you uncomfortable, and that's completely valid, but try to understand that he probably doesn't mean any ill will and that, more than likely, he has absolutely no clue he's even doing it. Try to talk to him about it, tell him you've noticed him acting a lot like you do and that it bothers you and that you'd like him to stop. He'll feel self conscious and might avoid you for a while so if you're keen on keeping him as a friend, just without the copying, try stressing that you don't want him to be out of your life, just to stop mirroring your behaviour.

On the other hand if he's doing it consciously to try and get closer to you, or if it's subconscious but he doesn't care that it bothers you because he wants to be closer to you or be like you, you might just have to cut him out altogether but that decision's up to you."

There are also no clear rules that can be applied because people don't consistently follow any of them. So, the best way to handle it to ""not be annoying"" is directly ask what their expectations are with texting.

\- What they consider a reasonable time frame.

\- What they consider too many messages at once.

\- How they handle conveying that they don't want to talk.

Clearing these things up is beneficial for both of you. Though in some cases, you might find some people who don't really know these things about themselves either. If that's the case, it is up to you if you want to continue dealing with that."

1- just go for it! even if it's not the smoothest intro or at the perfect time, you can still start a nice conversation. I'm sure they'll appreciate it, they're probably also nervous and lonely. 

2- start with ""hey, I think you're in my .... class"" or ""what do you think of the professor?"" It's a simple topic that you're both guaranteed to know about

3- a compliment and a question is a pretty standard way to introduce yourself ""nice dress, where's it from?"" or ""cute boots, are you excited that it's snowing?"" , etc

4- everyone says to not talk about yourself too much, but you need to a little bit! saying some stuff about yourself (name, grade, what you think of the class, etc)  will make the other person feel way more comfortable

5- find something to bond over! common enemies is a huge thing, so like if they're looking pissed or confused at the teacher, say something about how you're pissed/confused also"

- Walk tall, as if there is string attached to the top of your head and someone is pulling up on it. Make sure your shoulders are relaxed because this is key to allowing your arms swing normally.

- Keep your arms relaxed and let them sway at your sides while you walk. The point is not to focus on how your arms are swinging, just let them swing how they want to. But make sure they swing alternately, e.g. left arm in front/right arm behind, then vice versa. Avoid swinging both to the front, both to the back, etc.

In general I think that your arms shouldn't swing up more than about 45 degrees from the side of your body.

soc_311601,socialskills,reddit_comment,275,"You may be getting anxious when you wait for a social encounter because your mind is running a marathon thinking of things that could go wrong or wondering whether they will like you, etc. Something that really helped me was to re-contextualize my anxiety rather than trying to eliminate it. 

Emotions like anxiety happen, and suppressing them can often make them worse. So instead, I think of my anxiety as excitement. By looking at those butterflies in my stomach as harbingers of a damn good time, it relaxes me and helps to mitigate my anxiety. The hard thing about anxiety is, the more you think about it and resist it the worse it gets. When I embrace my anxiety as a valuable emotion, it transforms it into something else entirely.

With your parents, I think re-contextualization could help in this situation also. I used to be very embarrassed around my mother, she was very loud, brash and constantly made rude comments about me in public. For the longest time it REALLY bothered me and I couldn't stand to be around my mother in public even into adulthood. 

But one day something clicked. I kind of realized my mom was a little ridiculous, like... completely unreasonable. And it had nothing to do with me. Her bad behavior does NOT reflect on my character or personality. I am my own person and so are you. I now understand my mom is just socially inept and now when she makes comments in front of people (she hasnt changed much, but I have), I just laugh, ignore, and change the subject.

That's just my perspective, though. Hope it helps!"

&amp;#x200B;

Their response was not an actual answer to your question though. Just being yourself doesn't explain how to initiate conversations. You need to do a little bit more than that. But yes, it's good advice while a conversation is going on. Just be yourself. You don't need to lie, exaggerate, or whatever. Be relaxed and confident in yourself, and then people who will stick with you are worth the effort to try and keep in your circle of friends.

&amp;#x200B;

So, first, I'm going to explain you how to initiate conversations: With strangers... it's a hit and miss. Not everyone wants to talk, and it's not your fault if they don't wanna talk... so, a good start is to just start talking about the weather or something. It's cliche, I know. But sometimes people will happily share that because of this shitty rain they're really not looking forward to watching their kid's football game. And then you can ask about their kid's football game and if they're good. Etc. Just try and notice something you can ask a question about. But don't make it an interrogation where you ask question after question, feel free to share something of yourself as well and allow the other person to ask you a question and be interested. And this goes back and forth. And the best part of doing this exchange with a stranger? You may not see them ever again, so you can keep on trying on different people until you get the hang of it.   
Don't be afraid of people that don't really respond to your initiation of conversation, because chances are they're just not interested in any kind of conversation, and they'd respond this way with anyone, not just you, so it's not your fault or that you did something wrong. But DO take the hint and don't pursue.

If it's someone you already know... talk about something from last time you spoke. Did they mention having a test at school? Then ask how it went. This should be relatively straightforward and conversation flows from there, but yes, you do need to develop this skill of remembering what people said to you, and then follow up on it. Earns you points because other people will recognize that and appreciate it. Personally I had an issue with remembering what people said, which clearly made me look like I wasn't interested in them, but once I started focusing on it it's a lot easier to talk with people.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, for the question of ""who am I"". You are who you want to be. Sounds corny, but it's the truth.   
If you're not happy with your life right now, it's entirely up to you to fix that. There won't be a magical unicorn who will take you on a trip through time and show you who you are going to become and how to become like that. It's all you, and there's no manual for you, because you're unique. And it's unknown and somewhat scary.  
The only way to find an answer about who you are and what you'll like is to... try things you think you will like, do things you want to do. Maybe you will like it, maybe you won't. Either way, you learned something about yourself. This is an ongoing process. But it's important to not only \*think\*, but actually \*do\* something. This takes time, and effort. And it's best if you start as soon as possible. Sitting idle won't get you anywhere in life ;)"

An ambiguous opportunity for conversation. I'll say that much.

Yes the way you blink makes me want to come up to you and open a door, that way you can deliver your pick up line, and we can fuck. Also I just moved here from Mars so I have no other suitors so now is your chance.""

Whats the point of a compliment if it's barely a compliment? There's tons of compliments that would be acceptable, but I litetally one get the one that your grandma would give you ffs.

&gt;Until you admit that you don't know everything about women (and that internet people maybe DO know some things), and let go of your insecurity that's specific to women, you'll never get anywhere.

I don't. Never said I did, though. But I did know basic human acumen and logic and how that dictates their actions. Women and men aren't so different in on respect: if you have a feck ton of options is racially shifts your threshold for what you find acceptable. I have no idea how people are even trying to dispute this.

&gt;Being horny for two or twenty years is not justification for having illogical opinions

No it's not, and for the most part I don't have any. 

&gt;It is not logical to think most women have surfeit of choice

Most women have Tinder and social media right? Or umm...go outside? Then yeah any moderate attractive woman who doesn't any of those, let alone all three, has hot and cold running deck and options. But yeah, I'm sure that doesn't make you more particular in your options...nope.

&gt;that most women have unreasonably high standards

Never said unreasonably, just too much for the average man to meet.

&gt;that most women never flirt with guys like you

They don't...they have no reason to. 


&gt;That when most women compliment your outfit it can't possibly be a pickup line or a genuine compliment

I never said it was an IMPOSSIBILITY. I'm sure on many occasions it was a genuine compliment, bc there's no reason to just approach someone and lie...lol. My point was it doesn't at all read like a pick up line.

&gt;that most women WAIT to be presented with fuck opportunities

They do bc most of them have so many options. When you can hop on tinder and get a million matches or just go to a club and have 50 guys hit on you, you don't need to take the initiative. Sure, if a woman sees some guy that looks like Henry Cavil she'll be proactive, but beyond that she has no reason to. I'm sure they're proactive in getting feck opportunities when a man is worthy of it. I wouldn't know, chit never happens to me lol



&gt;and that most women are JUDGING you in a way that's special and different to how a man does.

Again, a man doesn't get defensive literally the moment I to them bc he think think trying to feck or get something from him or bc I'm not hot enough. 

&gt;WOMEN DON'T GATEKEEP SEX. SEX IS A MUTUAL DECISION, BOTH PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE THE GATE KEY

This is true if you're a high value man. Otherwise...lol"
soc_1577698,socialskills,reddit_comment,298,"Holy strawman Batman, no one said anyone must “always take the male side.” No one really said to take anyone’s side, I’d say neither the girl or OP are completely in the wrong, it’s a 3rd party who is. It’s just really funny seeing so many people bend over backwards and do mental gymnastics to pretend that what she said is really tame and that taking offense to it is stupid. 

 There are SEVERAL better ways to go about conveying the message she conveyed with a lot more tact, the only way she could have really done it worse is if she would have straight up called him ugly and gross. I guarantee that if the situation was reversed everyone here would be calling OP a piece of shit, or at the very least giving him a rough time for being so harsh. 

 The fact that this upsets you so much that you’ve made multiple comments attacking OP’s character as some misogynist who just hates women says all there is to say. If you really think that getting a bit hurt by her comment is outrageous and indicative of hating women, then I really don’t know what to tell you. I don’t know if spending time online has removed the concept of nuance to you or what, but you are SUPER jaded and it shows. So no, you shouldn’t “always side men”, it should be a case by case thing. Siding with a woman isn’t being a white knight, but looking at this situation and going “uh yeah, stop hating women” absolutely is, like, that’s actually sad. It’s really weird to degrade a stranger with random accusations just because you wanna look cool and like a champion for women or whatever. I hope she sees this, I guess"
soc_724059,socialskills,reddit_comment,108,"Well, I would argue about it. Everyone has a capacity for 'roaming free', that means you don't need people to constantly be around you. But the thing is, when you start seeing you are neglected and feel like you're the only one who makes and effort, that is a huge problem, because it usually lasts long enough to be sure that the relationship is dead.   


Carrying others is absolutely toxic and pointless. If they don't care enough to make you feel so neglected and bad, there is probably nothing to be reanimated.   


That is, if it's been happening for a really long time. With a lot of people."

soc_19748,socialskills,reddit_comment,277,"I think part of the reason you feel this way is that when people are in a larger group and they want to have a conversation in which everyone is included, that means you can't talk about things most people haven't heard about or are interested in. So you get casual conversations about what have you.

I don't know what you should do about this. I have sort of the same problem, and as a result I far prefer talking to people one-on-one or at least in smaller groups, because then you can actually have interesting conversations and, say, learn something new from them rather than just listen to general information which is semi-known and semi-interesting to everyone. 

If you really want to join in larger conversations, then I guess you either need to get with the program and add literally whatever pops into your mind. Is the weather being discussed? Someone thinks it's really cold outside today? Agree and point out that the forecast calls for equally cold weather all weekend. Is a TV show being discussed? If you've heard of it, oh wow I really like that, my favorite episode is so and so/that last episode was really great/when does it start again? If not, I've never heard of that, is it any good? Just ask a question or say whatever you think about the topic at hand.

That said, I don't think you should necessarily feel like not joining these conversations is a problem of yours. Being quiet in larger groups is completely ok, people are all different, and there's no real reason you should force yourself to discuss something you don't care about."

Now, if someone comes up to you and says ""hey, I think there might be something different about me, because I do X, Y, and Z, and most people do A, B, and C"", then they're seeking advice and you can share the information you have.

For example, making witty jokes, principles like love or respect, sharing good vibes, making a new friend just for the sake of making a new friend and that’s it- one more person I know the name of and had a 10 second glimpse of their personality and had a pleasant and/or funny interaction with.

soc_1748633,socialskills,reddit_comment,541,"&gt; Hanging around old people will lower your social value more than sitting at home doing what you enjoy. It's only a reminder that you have no one your own age.

There's no such thing as a universal social value measurement which is being kept track of. If you're at home, you still have no one your own age to talk to. This is part is intended for someone with anxiety to talk to others and having no idea how to hold a conversation. Sure, people in their 50s talk different than those in their 20s, but most people in their 50s sitting in a bar are generally friendly and this is just a start to see that talking to people is possible and have some positive feedback.


&gt; Super lame conversation starter that makes one sound like a clueless NPC hitting on a girl at a bar.

Is it though? Have you tried it? You don't need to have mind blowing opening lines and you're not looking for a hook-up. You're starting with a relatively innocent question which gives quite an obvious signal to the other that you're looking for someone to talk and the other has all the freedom to respond the way they want. If they don't want to talk, you let it go and go the next or wait a bit for someone to come in.

&gt; Or, they'll go ""Occasionally."" and that'll be that.

That's possible. Sometimes people don't want to talk or have trouble talking to others themselves as well. Now it's up to you to see if they have trouble or just don't want it. You can ask them directly if they rather not want to talk. There's nothing to lose in social status. 

&gt; 🤦🏻‍♀️

Please elaborate. Do you have trouble focussing on what other people are saying? Do you have trouble finding it interesting? Do you have trouble just standing there? If you can keep standing there, don't just stand there, listen. I can only think along with you if I can see some of your thoughts on this.

&gt; Which'll be the only buddies you have, and this literally only works for people that actually enjoy bars anyway. Meaning if you're an introvert, you generally won't relate well to anyone there.

Yeah, they will be. But you started out with none and no idea of how to make some. Generally you try to go places and do things together and find out you like someone and they like you back. But if you have trouble going anywhere regularly for a long time and have no idea how to start, you can start somewhere where the people may not be perfect but you can start to work on your own skills. You need small steps first to be confident enough for the bigger ones. And of course, by all means, if you feel like you can directly walk up to a group your age and have a chat and immediate chemistry which will bring you friends for life, go ahead. For all others, doing at least something may help you more than sitting another day at home. Of course you may also pick a different spot like a cafe, park or whatever."

To cut her out and avoid her means you save yourself loads of hassle and probably your mental health to a certain extent. But the problem is, you're leaving it open ended and potentially inviting her to contact you again. 
If you tell her that you don't want to see her again, I would tell her why. The bad thing about this is the reasons you've already said. The good thing is she then knows you no longer want her in your life and it might give her something to think about for the future.

soc_166996,socialskills,reddit_comment,340,"You're making it a lot more complicated than it really is. This shit is simple - this shit is INSTINCTIVE. You have the instinct - you've just been conditioned by years of anti-male-sexuality culture and abstinence-only sex ed that it's DEMONIC to have sexual desire.

Start by realizing, at your core, that you are a sexual being, and that's a GOOD thing. That'll help you be more at peace with being in situations where things are layed up to you (she wanted to lay down with you, dammit). If you're getting layups, utilize them - they'll not only be fun, but you'll start to understand how to be intimate when you're the one who needs to lead the interaction.

In order to learn to lead an interaction, approach women. Just approach. Even if you get rejected, you won't die, you won't get hit, you won't be ostracized as somebody who should never procreate. Approach the women you're most attracted to - during the day or the night. Be confident in your approach, do NOT come forward sheepishly. And if they reject you - so what? Life will go on and you'll meet tons more attractive ladies over the course of your approaches.

The next step would be to start understanding the concept of kinesthetics (kino for short) - utilize touching to your advantage to express sexual interest WITHOUT coming off as creepy (it's easy to do, just make sure it's gradual and accepted. When it's not, simply pull back). Get close to a lady. Be confident with yourself - look her in the eyes. 

Ultimately, however, this is a matter of confidence. You need to do this like you're comfortable with it. And if you're not - fake it for now. It'll become easy once you realize that your fears are unbased. And remember, you won't die if you get rejected. Everyone gets rejected - those who are good can take rejection in stride and aren't scared of it. You got this - message me if you have any questions."
soc_224978,socialskills,reddit_comment,336,"&gt;Don't complain. Being a Negative Nancy is an instant turnoff.

**Every** trait, choice and opinion has both supporters and dissenters. For example: I like vanilla ice cream, my friend does too and that makes us stronger friends, and this other guy thinks I'm a lameo for liking the default flavour and having no class.

This is the same for **everything**, whenever you have an opinion, some people will support you and others will hate you.

Positivity and negativity is one of these. Positive people only like other positive people and will avoid negative people (they will just disappear). Negative people like other negative people and will hate on positive people.

That advice makes sense coming from a positive person perspective. Tell everyone to be positive, because my and all my friends honestly don't like negative people. But if you aren't a positive person...

**It is up to you to choose your personality, and craft it in the direction you want.**

&gt;In both cases, I feel like ""acting likeable"" would actively prevent me from either solving my problems ... I will do better at solving both with other people's support, 

Here you are inching on the next level of persuasion. This is where you let go of all societal conventions and leave the truth. I won't go too deep into this but I will leave a book title: *Blair Warren - The Forbidden Keys to Persuasion Lesson Manual*.

&gt;I also find body language advice to be extremely self-consciousness inducing. 

Bottom up body language adjusting doesn't work. You need to target the source (your mind), then let the behaviours come from that. Honestly most body language sources miss this distinction, this leads to the opposite effect of using body language.

The main takeaway is to choose your own personality and craft towards that. You are right to be sceptical of that article (and ones like it), it is all general advice, and mostly wrong (it is like cold and flu medication, it treats the symptoms, not the cause)."

There's no extra tips to give you because this is about her insecurity. She needs to get to the very root of her insecurity, accept it, and embrace positivity. That's not up to you nor can you persuade her with compliments.

It doesn't hurt to compliment her every once in awhile but you're beating a dead horse if you think there's anything you can do. I'd say the only thing you can really do is try to get her to talk about her insecurities on a deep and introspective level."

But now with more information, I understand your reaction but you need to answer your friends who are reaching out. They are trying to be a friend. That situation sucked. But it’s really not bad friends. I’ve been in similar situations, both stuck inside the club and stuck outside. Typically when that’s the case at least in America, they are going to let you in, you just have to wait your turn instead of cutting the line bc your friends already went in. They stayed in contact with you during this situation- that’s not ditching. Your friends tried to leave and join you but couldn’t. They didn’t ditch you, your reaction is valid but I think if there’s a next time of similar situation be more patient with the situation. I’d try to let go of the bad feelings and respond to your friends. 
Also if you can’t be mad at someone for telling them to do something in a sarcastic tone and expect them to understand or do what you want. If you feel a certain way tell them, communicate. If you communicate your feelings and then they don’t care - then they are being a bad friend. 

To me this sounds like good friends in a bad and new situation and not knowing what to do. They are reaching out and even offering to pay for you to make up for the shitty night that was out of their control. They are trying, try back before you loose them. Let go of that night and move on."

Sound kinda condescending. Like, maybe if they were a small child you would say these things, but if they're an adult peer I think this would come off as odd, like they're especially upset by the weather compared to you or something. 

Instead I'd suggest talking about how the weather has affected *your* day, feelings, plans, etc., or both you and the other person's plans equally e.g. ""I really hope it clears up a little in time for my lunch break so I can walk to the cafe without getting wet"" or ""*I* can't wait to get home and cosy up with a book and a hot chocolate, that's one thing I do love about this kind of weather"", or ""I think it's so dull being cooped up in the office on dreary days like this"" or whatever.

&gt;Person 2: Yeah they are.

Like, you talk about what's up with you, they take it as an invitation to talk about themselves, you can then talk more about whatever they say. So they might respond ""oh, I wish I was into the whole indoors thing, I was actually really pumped to go for a jog this afternoon"", to which you can say something like ""oh really, do you jog much? i really ought to more but i can never seem to find the time"", etc, etc.

Ask yourself the following thought experiment if you would.

If I were to look back as a future me on past me and noticed that there were quite a few people who had had intimate relationships that had done a lot of exploring and a lot of enjoying and a lot of what you come to find out is very ethical and very moral behavior for current you as well as current them and these people also have a lot of self-knowledge about what they like physically and sexually and romantically, and have a lot of emotionally close relationships and seem to have a lot of positive experiences and then you do not. What do you think your state of mind is going to be after this process happens? How far behind your other birth cohorts are you going to be? When you decide to go ahead and do try to do this stuff then? What would happen if your sexuality changes? What happened? If your gender identity changes? What would happen if the world changes and suddenly the things that are supposedly considered wrong and bad are thought of with a much more tolerant if not approved or permissive attitude? What if your religion changes? What if your health changes? What if you look all the way to your debt and realize that you have nothing but regret? What if you have mental health problems and suddenly you don't like the concept of your body and then use the lack of having an actual partner or close relationships as a way of justifying the self-harm of not using self-care and your fundamental health changes in your fundamental body shape changes? How much harder do you think it's going to be to get back on track with people? Assuming you have relationships with people around your same age, how much harder is it going to be to rejoin a group of people who haven't committed any kind of monstrous evil besides the concept of being able to love and laugh and help and hold each other?

Basically what I'm getting at is connection is a fundamental human thing. I wanted to write a giant massive comment on this and go point by point, but figure it's more important if you have these questions right now out of the gate taken care of.

For every random pickup artist he tries to lie and cheat and get his way or her way into another person's pants. Think about what would happen when you have two consenting people that love each other? And also realize that the feeling of not having been seduced by someone not having been seen as desirable by someone can hurt for decades if not for a lifetime.

Yeah this happened to me. I had the same exact attitude and the same exact problems.

At least you fundamentally are fairly attractive and don't have a lot of self-doubt, but you never know when that could change either. Aging is an unpredictable mistress.

And yes things like all of the above with all those above kind of shifts can and have happen to people and I can personally attest because they've happened to me. The me of a person around your age, if told that a person of my age now at 41 would have been like it is now, I wouldn't have believed you.

Over the years I have realized one very important fact of life. 

1. It’s just you baby. Seriously, it’s all about you. You’re surrounded with other people, animals and things, but all you can control is yourself. Go out and have as much fun as you can, and do what makes you happy! (Please don’t go around hurting anything). But if you enjoy something pursue it and don’t let anybody tell you it’s not right, because their opinions don’t matter. If you do this and you’re having a good time, chances are that others will look up to you for having this courage. They will approach you, and if you like them, invite them into your life. This is how friends are made. On the flip side, if you see somebody doing what you enjoy, let them know! 

When you were headed into your first day of middle school, and your mom said “be yourself and everybody will love you”. This is what she was talking about. Unfortunately not everybody will love you, but the people who don’t shouldn’t hold power over your life, because they will bring you down. 

Today I’m a second year in college, I’m independent, I have a fantastic friend group and I thoroughly enjoy life. I really hope you consider giving this outlook on life a try, I’d be willing to bet it helps with your problem :) "
soc_630207,socialskills,reddit_comment,103,I think you need to figure out why you have that desire. It’s hard to say exactly what it is because everyone is different but if you take the time and really explore your desires you might find that it’s not that you desire something else entirely. Maybe it’s not about having someone else but you just want some form of validation. Maybe it’s just that you want that feeling of security or maybe it’s just sexual. Whatever it is I think you need to figure that out and see if there is something else in your life that can fulfill that role.
soc_252828,socialskills,reddit_comment,867,"its okay bro. when you become competent at something that disproves a previous belief you will hold on to it till the end of time. 

in your case, i was ugly/scrawny (belief) then you switched the behaviour to disprove that (maybe working out), you got competence and got change, once that is realized your new belief was - i am attractive. 


exept, being attractive isn't the end all be all with women (its only a piece of the puzzle), as you've found out you need personality, character, and social skills to communicate with them, to be a ""textured"" human over a bland, plain, boring or unintresting. easiest way is to brush against people, like you, unlike you, and way beyond you, aka talk to kids, adults, (they don't fit in your demographic but that is ok, you'll learn something about it). go out to places, you'll learn, you have stories to tell, you will develop emotionally, you'd see new perspectives beyond your demographic, that is why the guy who wrote ""improve social skills"" recommends that to be social, even with women, you talk to everyone, men women, child adult, old young, etc. because everybody is human, and all human have emotions and thoughts and beliefs and shit, you could generalize people, in a way, we are all made of meat and bone, experience pain and experience pleasure, so once you know this, you could shift a bit the strategy to approach the person, you wouldn't approach a child talking in a profesional manner, and youwouldn't approach a proffesional with informal talk, it doesn't work like that. establish fundamentals. 



look, what worked for me is to not fly too close to the sky, (don't get cocky and arrogant) because usually when you get overconfident on your ability you fuck up. 

when i tried to learn social skills, i did a KWL, which is a map for organizing ideas you got this in first grade. 

you write what you want to Know about the subject&lt; usually is brainstorming or experience

then what you Want to learn &lt; my case was to learn to people, and get along with them (general not just women) carry a conversation. 


and then HARD WORK at trying to learn what you think you want to learn. 


And then LEARNED. fucking, this is a bitch, when i started i only thought a conversation was about topics of conversation, aka ""not knowing what to say"" i thought that if i knew what to talk about i'd be gold. 

well fuck no! i learned about body language, (you communicate with shit you don't even saY! crazy) 

and a bunch of social tricks, 

one trick i learned from ""How to win friends and influence people"" by dale carnagie, (book is on sidebar recommendation)

well one of the book chapter resorts to remember people's name, and whenever you see them talk to them, or greet them, you call their name, so fucking easy, yet people miss this, i know i did, and instead call people ""hey bro"" very informal. 

so what i found is being formal first then, transition to casual. 

this means when introducing yourself or others, you be formal first, show manners and respect. 

hey im jake, you are?.

then after the days pass you go into more casual you talk more about random shit, and now you can call them dude or bro, but you have to respect first and have than comfort level at the right time, it don't take long though, so you can do that, 

and BAM new friend was made simply by greeting, them or even listening or engaging them in some conversation, now whenever you have a problem you can rely in good friend you've made trhough respect and honesty and being casual. 



The trick, i think towards *really* learning social skills, is to assume you know nothing, DROP the KWL once you've done it, and read books! start from scratch, and assume you only have the essentials, you and language to communicate, that is it, you are no where to be competent or nothing, you know nothing. 

i got this idea from the guy of ""improve your social skills"" if you visit his site you'd see he mentions he has Asperger's syndrome and so because of that he couldn't pick up on things people talked about, say sarcasm or exageration, or even jokes, but he worked balls to the walls and now this guy, who supposibly should be a total inept at communication is teaching people who are more competent at language and social skills to be better communicator, how ironic is that? 


so keep that in mind, try new things, assume nothing, you know nothing, start from scratch (even if you do have some tricks or some concepts down) work work at it, believe that you can have enough and you'll get there. NEVER FEEL ENTITLED&lt; let the work (actual results) you've put in reflect  your true success. 

it is all up to you, the books wont read themselves, they are there, but its you who will determine how badly you want to get good at being a good communicator, your motivation turns pages not the plot in books.

soc_1816853,socialskills,reddit_comment,220,"10 people at dinner. If one is openly a Nazi, they are all Nazis.

Your close friend is not a friend.  Your other two friends are enabling the N word friend.  This is a choice they are making.  What purpose does it serve other than to offend people?  If you, as a black person and their friend, cannot explain his offensiveness to him, who can?

I've spent a fair amount of time in India.  I was married to a Portugese/Indian man from Guyana.  Indians, like many other nationalities are openly racist.  The Japanese are openly racist.  They keep it low key, but ""no foreigners allowed"" is a perfectly acceptable position in Japan.  China and the Middle East are openly racist.  So are most places in the world.  We are the exception, not the rule.  We have to fight to keep that if we want it.  Situations like this are how we do that.  One person at a time.

You have to decide where your boundaries are.  I think you deserve better friends. No need to make a scene.  You have told them.  Just quietly start finding better people to hang out with until they have faded into the past.  

Thrive.  Succeed.  Live a good life.  See them at the 10 year reunion and let your success be the best revenge."
soc_738273,socialskills,reddit_comment,579,"Certainly. 

1. Data. Concrete and clear examples. For instance if your spouse is driving in a way that makes you uncomfortable you should mentally or physically document the number of times they speed or act aggressively and could put hard numbers on it. “When I ride with you I notice that you often speed 10-15 miles over the limit on the highway nearly 90% of the time and on average you make 5 aggressive lane changes without using your signal.” 

2. What you think about this boundary violation. This can be things like “when you speed I think about how you could be pulled over and the cost of the ticket and how it could affect our insurance premiums. I also think about how dangerous driving can be and your quick lane changes could result in an accident.”

3. Emotion. Now you explain how those thoughts make you feel. “When I think about how you could be putting us in danger both financially and physically it makes me really upset. I feel uncomfortable being in the passenger seat with you.” 

4. Next you identify your power in this situation and specify your needs. Your options are:

1) I have the power to create (this would be for a personal internal boundary or something within your control and not the actions of another. In the driving example you could refuse to ride with your spouse unless you’re the one driving and take control that way)
2) I need help (asking your spouse to wash dishes when you cook, or seeking therapy advise for yourself for an internal boundary)
3) I need to make a request (the driving example, you can’t force or demand another person to do anything. You can only make a request for different behavior but it needs to be concise. For instance asking your spouse to drive “better” is vague. Ask for them to not go more than 5 -10 mph over the speed limit and to use their turn signals for every lane change is specific)
4) I am powerless (it’s beyond your ability to control or change and you need to decide if continued interaction is good for you or to just accept things the way they are)

5. Evaluate the results of your career conversation based on the steps you took to think through the boundary above. If your spouse agrees and says they will do what you’ve requested then great! 

If they commit to changing their behavior but don’t follow through then another pass through step 4 is necessary and might entail an escalation in self care. For the driving example you might say you’ll only ride in the car if you’re driving or agree to take separate vehicles no matter how inconvenient. It’s not a punishment but a firm stance on your boundary and dedication to self care. 

If they refuse your request and don’t try to negotiate a different agreement you have to decide how to proceed that’s best for you. Either take control of the situation by not putting yourself in the position to have your boundary violated, come to terms with the fact you can’t change the situation, or remove yourself from that relationship if it’s that serious. 

Sorry that wasn’t too short but it’s the best summary I could think of.

Also, if you think you're already good at small talk, then try to take it further: start trying to make plans with people or start trying to make your conversations more significant or interesting/personal.

You're right, bonds don't develop over small talk, which is why you gotta make it an experience. Experiencjng things with people or having deeper conversations with people deepens the bond. But you're the one who has to take your relationship with that person by the reigns.

soc_1304512,socialskills,reddit_comment,285,"Small Talk is basically ""throwing shit to the wall to see what sticks""
Both parties are just going through random topic's until they find one that sparks a deeper conversation.
Sometimes they find this ""spark"" immediately - sometimes they don't and the conversation ends rather awkward. Listen to other people's conversation and you'll see that this happens everywhere. 

I also struggle a lot with basic human interactions, so I can't tell you what ""normal"" people think when the conversation goes nowhere. Do they think that the other person is boring? I don't think so, but I don't know for sure. But what I can tell you is: even if they do, it doesn't matter.
I know that I'm not a boring person, so I don't care that they may think of me as boring.
We just didn't find a common topic, or maybe I was to shy to really say what I'm thinking about something but that's ok.
I tried to be someone else for almost my whole life and it made me unhappy and addicted to drugs (any drug that makes you talkative) but didn't end up working anyway.
Since I started accepting myself, my conversations are less .. forced.
I just talk and the personal stuff just comes up itself.
Also: if you don't feel comfortable about talking about personal stuff, that's absolutely ok. Some people may appreciate this. Stop forcing yourself into some kind of ideal you may have of yourself.
Accept yourself and accept that you might not ""flow"" with everyone, which is totally okay.
You're definitely not a boring person from what I've read so far, if that helps you.

Just my opinion, I think it is curable for the most part. Confidence comes from knowing you're capable of doing something, kind of like how you wouldn't be nervous for a test that you just know so well. It's just hard to reach that point because it's not as simple as studying hard for one test. You have to study *and* do well on many tests to overcome this anxiety.

But I think your propensity for anxiety isn't necessarily curable, just the reasons for your anxiety. Plenty of people are anxious people but are very charismatic and intelligent, they just don't have many current reasons to be anxious.

Just my take."

It's ok to explore and try new things but you'll soon realise if what you're doing seems forced and makes you feel self-conscious. 

A lot of music is heavily hyped because it's easily marketable. You don't have to fall for it or pretend to like it because other people do. When you hear something that you find really good or dope or whatever, you'll know. But remember that it's all subjective. And there's always something else to connect with people over, even if you seem to like different things. Maybe this answer helps better, or even worse than before. I can't tell because you don't give a lot to go on.

There are plenty of kind people out there. You just have to find that crowd. Also, some naturally kind people don't seem that kind because they feel the pressure that you describe, or have a defence mechanism of seeming stand-offish, cruel, or sarcastic etc. "

I would get a bit anxious and rush what I was saying and stutter for some reason. 

As I got older and gained more confidence, I didn't rush myself when I talked, and if I didn't get the floor or was interrupted, I just went with the flow.

I'll occasionally stutter now (almost always in similar circumstances) but I stop, take a deep breath, and talk slower.

The people your age may criticize you for it, and let them, it's your choice who you're around.

soc_481459,socialskills,reddit_comment,177,"One way is to literally just walk up, and with a loud, but friendly voice, ask if you can join in the conversation. You can say “I thought this would be a nice group to talk with, care if I join?” Or “mind if I join, unless I’m interrupting a secret talk?” 

The goal is to appear friendly and open-minded. Add a joke about the awkwardness, because the sooner you address it, the easier it is to get over. If you have a concern that deals with the group, say it, and continue from there. 

Overall, don’t be afraid of messing up, but, instead, listen and show actual concern for the group. It’s about inclusion, so if you show that you want to be inclusive, then you shouldn’t have too much of a problem.

Keep in kind that everyone is different, so the group can choose not to incorporate you. Just keep this in mind as a possibility and accept that it may happen. Effectively, don’t set expectations on yourself besides your hardline “no’s” in any situation. "

If you're consistently getting less out of the relationship than you're putting into it. Then spend less time with them. 

All relationships have a cost and a return value. Example: you put in time, energy or money in as a cost, and you get fun, companionship, support as a return. 

If you are generally getting a negative return for your time/energy/money, like leaving the situation stressed, sad, or angry, then you're getting a negative return. 

It sounds really cold to think about it like that, but in the end that's what it boils down to, you could invest your time and energy in other relationships that work better for you. 

Everyone is different, so you're definitely not at fault, but neither is he. But you might just be realising you're not a great fit for being BFF's. Doesn't mean you need to stop speaking to them, but maybe just start looking for other people to spend time with.

Also sometimes you can’t go looking for things and have to learn to be content with yourself before things will gravitate to you. 

That being said, if you are dead set on this, you have to change your mindset. You have to DECIDE to be whatever personality. You can’t second guess it. You have to change how you view things. Sometimes it’s just doing the opposite of what you normally do. Either way, i’d make a list of the traits you want and then come up with actions to portray that.

2. Do things because you want to. Fuck the rules. Want to give a homeless guy money do it but only cause you want to. Pick up the tab but only cause you want to. Never do anything to be nice or just because its the right thing. Do the right thing but only because you want to.

3. Everyone is different and its unreasonable for you to expect a splendidly unique individual such as yourself to use a generic aproach to dating.

If it was paralyzing or you spent hours wondering what she thought of what was being said, then you are probably crossing over into an unhealthy area.

The greatest advice for confidence I've heard continues to be ""Fake it until you make it."" If you are feeling self-conscious or unconfident, pretend that you are someone who is confident and self-assured. 99% of the time no one can tell the difference.  After a while, you begin to realize the confident ""character"" you are playing is just you pretending not to care. After a while, you get used to not caring what people think.

There is no right or wrong choice. It's your choice. It's a choice that may or may not benefit you. But who are they to set the parameters on what makes that choice ""right""? I'm sure many of your day-to-day choices go against what a lot of people are planning. You come into a restaurant and order food, the cashier wants to be out of there by 8, but has to take your order, she stays 5 minutes later, misses the bus and is home half an hour before she planned. Boom. You just ruined her evening. But who cares? 

Especially with such abstract and grandiose ideas as the destiny of our species, no one is right or wrong.

Comes with practice like any social skill. Basically, mix in normal social skills with teasing and touching (it's important to break the touch barrier early if you have any intentions beyond friendship with the person). Everyone has their own way of flirting, it's up to you to find yours. My flirting is extremely obvious, though I kind of like that since it shows interest pretty cleanly without having to vocalize it.

&gt; am being really bad at gauging how to react appropiately in situations

Once again, comes with practice. Pretty vague, can't help there.

&gt; come on too strong to girls all the time.

How so?

&gt; I'm a senior in college and never asked out a girl or had a girlfriend or had any female friends. Since college is the only part of my life where I have access to SO many girls in such a sociable environment I feel like I wasted 3 fucking years and lost out/missed on so much on dating and want to

Was in a similar scenario and fixed it for myself. Better late than never, you're still in college.

&gt; So what do I do? She said wanted to meet next week but didn't respond yet as to what days she's free (she said she's usually free in the afternoon on most weekdays in school). The last time I texted her was Thursday and she hasn't responded yet. 

Did she see the message? If not, say nothing. If she did, I'd still say wait until Sunday or so to send another one. If she doesn't reply to that one, she's probably not interested. Considering she wanted to meet up, I imagine there's at least some interest.

&gt; How many times is texting excessive in a week

Varies based on both parties and the situation. If you see her often, it's more acceptable to text less. If you don't see her too often it's acceptable to text her more. Once or twice a week early on imo is enough. Girls (and people in general) like people who lead interesting lives, if you go too overboard it seems like you have nothing else going on in your life.

&gt; how many times is hanging out too excessive in a week

More than once or twice early on is excessive in my opinion as well. You want her to know you're interested, but you don't want to seem clingy either.

Can't answer the rest since I think it pertains more to stuff that is more specific to American dating culture."
soc_1187879,socialskills,reddit_comment,330,"Sometimes you just have to have parts of you that the people around you can’t relate to it’s just part of life. Everyone is different and won’t like the same thing, think of liking to draw but none of your friends understand why you like it, you wouldn’t give up drawing but you would mention less or maybe never. In those situations you can find a group or someone who has the same interest as you then you will fill your need to share what you love with someone. 

You don’t have to show all your sides to the people around you, but once you make a side of yourself for others it’s like giving up on being yourself. I am barely “impressed” by my friends they might do something where I’m proud and happy for their achievements but  I have high hopes for my friends so nothing to be impressed by. You have to think why do you want to impress the people around you, because someone being impressed is a fleeting moment and soon forgotten. Do you think if you can’t impress them that you are not being a cool or interesting person? Maybe it’s something else.

Other than what I have said above it sounds like you need to have more confidence in yourself to stop having a need for others praise, praise is not bad the the only way you will feel fulfilled and complete is being 100% sure of who you are as a person, in your abilities and realizing that you choose your own worth and not others. You also need to have more confidence in the people around you as to know that people around you would not hang out with someone who doesn’t bring up the mood. People hang out with people they want to and the fact you have friends shows they think it is more fun with you around. Keep working on yourself and it will probably turn out fine."

Maybe your friend never has time to themselves so they don’t really feel like starting a conversation that would take more of their already non-existent energy. 

Sometimes for me it’s one of those things, and sometimes it’s all of them at once. And it always kills me because I KNOW that my friends and loved ones are taking time out of their day to reach out so I should respect them by replying. It’s just not that simple though. The anxiety that comes with my own social insecurities is overbearing when someone reaches out.

Remember that just because your perception of life and social skills is one way doesn’t mean your friends’ perceptions are the same. They may be going through some emotional or mental baggage, and it’s up to you to let go of your expectations of what you THINK they should do based on your own personal habits. If you don’t want to wait around for them then maybe you’re waisting your energy on something you shouldn’t and it’s time to move on. 

TL;DR: You never know what someone is going through internally. Act with compassion and live your life without worrying about how others aren’t living up to your standards. "
soc_1653886,socialskills,reddit_comment,295,"If texting is an issue for you (I hate it too), then try to be the person that arranges in-person meetings. Most friends/friend groups will appreciate the person that does the organisation for them to go and see that movie, or who will host a board game night, or who throws that surprise party for someone else, things like that.

I think frequency is a personal thing as different people like different levels of contact. I'd say as a good baseline try texting once a week, but keep it lowkey (e.g. 'saw this meme and thought of you', 'it's so hot today, I'm melting. You?') and know that the point is to brighten someone's day a little, which doesn't involve necessarily having a full conversation. The full conversations can wait until you're in person. If that feels right to you, keep at it, but if it feels like too much or too little for the person you're talking with then adjust accordingly.

With my friends, I usually see each one anywhere from once a week to once a year. We're all busy and work a lot, so even without kids we have little free time. I'd say aim for once a month, and again, adjust according to what you're feeling from the person - if they're really busy they might appreciate less, or if they're really craving friendship more might be appreciated.

Sorry these are vague answers, but it's better to pick a frequency and see how it works out for you rather than let yourself get bogged down in the decision-making - it'll become clearer as you try it how much is healthy for you to do, as well as what the individual preferences of your friends are. There's no wrong answer! Good luck!"

Don't be worried about the consequences of revealing your true self because it will catch up to you later anyways.

soc_1822534,socialskills,reddit_comment,182,"Hi!

So, i dont know you personally, but i think you are bellitling yourself. If you dont think so, try this exercise: Imagine if a friend came up to you with the same insecurities that you are feeling, and he asked you for advice, would you feel like he is a pushover? Probably not, you would be quick to dismiss it, since you know he is being to harsh with himself.

What i am trying to say is that your personality is not the problem, your core self is probably fine, maybe your problems are other problems. Maybe you just need to set boundaries, maybe you just need to create self esteem, or maybe you just need to open up with a friend.

Dont try to change who you are at your core so you can please a few people, treat yourself as if you were a friend of yours. We tend to be very self critical about ourselves, but the truth is that we are as worthy of attention and care as anyone else. Try to keep that in mind :)"
soc_363892,socialskills,reddit_comment,287,"Lots of people here telling you to cut off your friends, I don't believe that's a good idea because they're still your long time friends and that's hard to replace. I'm learning as you get older It becomes harder and harder to find friends that have the time and energy to build a relationship like the one you have in your circle. Dont stop making new friends but also keep those around who you still enjoy to be around.

Now, First, DO NOT think to yourself ""It's because they dont like me"" that's not the case, given you have a good time when you go out and if you keep thinking that way, self consciously you'll make it a reality.

 My advice to stop being the forgotten friend is to hang out with each one individually and develop an 'outside the group' relationship with each one. Whom you choose is up to you but with that one individual, throw him a funny text or meme or ask him for advice (even if you don't use it) and get some inside jokes between you and him/her. Hang out but don't just say, ""hey let's hang out"" and then have nothing, plan out something you'd both enjoy and make it seem like it popped out of nowhere and you thought of him/her and if you want, later, you can invite your other friends to join in so it doesn't get stale. This makes it apparent that they joined YOU, not you joined them. Keep at it and remember to be yourself.

TLDR: Develop different individual relationships in your circle so when you all hang out they see you in a deeper light then just that friend who tags along. "
soc_783046,socialskills,reddit_comment,234,"It’s tough to say why they did these things. Even if people tell you what they think happened, they’re probably wrong. You’re basically asking us to read the minds of 2 random strangers we’ve never met based on a couple paragraphs.

Sorry if that sounds mean, I’m not trying to be mean, I just want you to know why I can’t answer your question. The important thing to know is that everyone is different. Love is a big commitment, especially for some people, and they often have second thoughts or hesitations or doubts. It may not even be something you did wrong. 2 girls? That’s nothing. Even if 10 girls rejected you, you still might not be doing anything wrong.

What’s most important to know is that it’s normal to be rejected the majority of the time. I’ve been with hundreds of girls but I’ve been rejected by thousands. There are so many reasons why things can end up not working out, but very few that lead to mutual interest. You can’t get discouraged after just 2. There are plenty more girls out there and you’ll be rejected plenty more times. Just keep at it and eventually you’ll find someone that leads to something more. Be prepared to not only be rejected though, you may also find many girls turn out to be unfit for you, as well, once you get to know them."

dude, this makes no sense. so if I don't talk to someone for 
3 years after they (not?) ghosted me, and then I do and they respond...I haven't been ghosted? what about a year? 6 months? a month?

like if you've gone through the emotional and mental process of being ghosted...you've been ghosted. if youve gone through that, nothing is gonna retroactively change that experience.

you know this isn't any kind of advice right? and frankly I think it's a little reckless to just say ""get over it"" and expect people to just figure out how to deal with those very real and sometimes very strong emotions. the ""how"" is the advice that I'm offering. I don't see anyone else offering this advice which **is the entire concern with being ghosted. if it didn't have an emotional impact it'd be a non-issue. so why are we completely ignoring the emotional impact?**

Let's look at this a little bit: if Rachel has only met you twice, is it more likely she has some ulterior motive and dislikes you, or that she wants to get to know you more before deciding how she feels about you?

As someone who struggles to make friends, my perspective is that Rachel is probably interested in getting to know you more but doesn't want to come off too pushy by inviting you since you've only met twice, so she asked a middle person to kind of mediate. But that's of course just my perspective and I don't know her at all"
soc_551148,socialskills,reddit_comment,222,"Yeah, that's something I've been struggling with, and haven't quite figured an answer for. 

BUT, Some things I've found that helped a little: 

- Find people with similar interests/dispositions as you. People who support you.

- Challenge yourself to push out of your comfort zone.

- allow yourself to be yourself. Feeling vulnerable is okay. People who appreciate your true self will gravitate to you.

- do more adventurous things, or find activities that really click with you. I usually feel very comfortable meeting and conversing with people when I go hiking or go bicycle touring. The people you meet tend to be like minded, kind, and generous. That's a typical outdoorsy, athletic, nature lover. Doing this over time has given me lots of story material, confidence, and happiness. But that's just me. 😁

- also, just my opinion, but the effect of drinking is just an illusion. I find that it's just a crutch--I feel uninhibited pretending to drink at parties, the same as when I don't. I feel uninhibited because I perceive, in social drinking environments, people will judge me less for something weird i might do or say. I'm starting to realize that I generally judge myself more than other people judge upon me -- and the social stakes really aren't as high as my brain tends to believe."
soc_1411254,socialskills,reddit_comment,137,"It really depends on the person. But you have to make them comfortable first. I’m one of those people where I think it’s awkward if someone asks straight up. The mood needs to be set, and you can ask them to come back to your place. Just know however, there’s always a chance it won’t happen and you have to be okay with that. If you’re too aggressive and straightforward, a lot of women won’t react well to that. However I wouldn’t be shocked if there were some women who like when a guy is straight up- but I don’t know many. It’s always good to set up the mood and the intention but not have too many expectations. And also don’t push it either if they aren’t interested. Being genuine and understanding is very important here."
soc_1238799,socialskills,reddit_comment,225,"I know similar people and I can relate, personally. I find a lot of what people talk about, kinda dull. But I am pretty comfortable with discomfort and boredom so, I cope okay. I also have a career in the mental health field and I think the fact that this improves with stimulants and you know you ADHD- suggests that is a contributor. That doesn’t mean your only solution is medication, but it suggests that it would help. (cue the sage that says everyone is different- it’s true). If for instance your  typical stimulant was a party variety, I would encourage you to explore safer, medical alternatives. But medication aside, you are hardly alone. I do not for a moment believe solitude is your destiny.  I tend to steer my questions in conversation to my interests. For example,
today’s weather is boring to me, but weather in general and climate change is interesting. Dogs are a common topic that bores me, only because it’s always the same thing, but the history of dogs and questioning ethics of breeding is interesting to me. Sports, I got nothing, but the future of sports and gender is interesting to me. My point is don’t add to your misery by asking things things that don’t interest you. Try to steer a bit to what you like when you can."
soc_8292,socialskills,reddit_comment,246,"I understand how you feel. The funny thing is, a lot of your classmates feel awkward and shy too, so you're not weird or unusual for feeling that way. It's normal to feel anxious when a whole room of strangers is staring at you. Grown-ups also have this anxiety and few get over it. Taking an acting class or debate class will help you deal with it, which will pay off in a big way later in life. Know that if you're speaking in front of a class, most of the kids are just sitting there feeling happy that they're not doing it at the moment, and no one is really judging you personally.

One way to make conversation easy is to ask questions. Have you heard this tip before? Ask a person what they think, or what they like, and automatically they think of you as an interested, friendly person and will open up to you. Once they answer your question, you can respond naturally and you'll have a great conversation. If someone comes up to you and wants to talk, assume good will on their part first, and respond in a friendly manner. Turn the conversation to them as quickly as possible.

Real friendships take time and effort, so don't expect to make BFFs very soon. Be yourself and be honest, and the right people will find you. No matter what, you must believe in yourself and be your own best friend. Good luck!"

Let's be friends!"" and expect everything to flow smoothly. A lot of people are aware of this and how awkward it can get. You need to get a bit more general and less cheesy. But believe it or not it's not that hard to meet people. There's no secret way of talking, no cheat codes to magically persuade them, nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

If someone came up to you tomorrow at school at school or whatever and said ""Hey bro you look like a cool guy, what's your name? I'm Trent"", wouldn't you accept the friendship right then and there? A lot of people are caught up with trying to make friends with their own efforts, when it will be much easier for you to approach them and seek friendship. They will feel at ease, and feel good at the same time knowing that someone wanted to get to know them. They will feel much more honored seeing that someone else actually took the initiative to spark a conversation with them.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically my advice is to just go for it. Just be general. A simple ""Hey dude what's your name?"" is more than enough, and people will be very appreciative of that. Of course introducing yourself with a similar interest to them can be better, but it's not really necessary."

soc_678719,socialskills,reddit_comment,456,"You are right you shouldn’t have to like yourself to get basic human respect, but do you have another plan? 
People are fucked up, they will treat you like the way you treat yourself. It’s not that they take a chance to be mean to you because they somehow know that you don’t like yourself, it’s just that people are rude if you don’t stand up for yourself, if you don’t set boundaries. 
And standing up for yourself if really hard when you dislike yourself. So if you like yourself, you can stand up for yourself so people will treat you with respect. 
And when you like yourself it doesn’t really matter if other people dislike you, because your selfworth won’t be completely dependent on how others treat you. 

You say that you shouldn’t have to like yourself to get basic human respect. How long are you going to hold on to this thought? How do you know that this is true? Have you ever tried liking yourself in order to test this idea? 
If you hold on to this idea nothing will change in your life, because I think that you just want to be accepted by other people. People can show basic human respect and you’ll still feel that you’re not being really accepted by these people. But everything will change when you start to accept yourself. 

How can you say to yourself that you are FUCKED UP, when you are also a nice person, when you are helpful and supportive? Having these two thoughts causes an internal conflict. 
1. Other people say indirectly-&gt; you are fucked up
2. But your can think-&gt; I’m nice other people,I’m helpfull and supportive, that makes me a good person. 

The REAL questions is NOT which one is true, but in which one am I going to BELIEVE. 

1. Am I going to believe that I’m fucked up because random strangers give me this idea because they treat me like shit, so every time when someone treats me like shit, I can use that as an argument for the statement “I’m fucked up/there is something wrong with me”. 
 
2. Or am I going to believe that there is actually nothing wrong with me, because I’m Nice to people and helpful and supportive. But everytime someone is rude, you have to keep believing that there is nothing wrong with you, you have to stand up for yourself. 

It’s up to you. 
I would recommend the second option. It’s a lot harder than option 1, but in the long term (spoiler alert) it’s totally worth it! 
Choose wise. Good luck!

soc_1182941,socialskills,reddit_comment,547,"Disclaimer, this is just my opinion based on my life experiences and observations as a female his age. 

Ok so one thing I’ve noticed, is when I go on dates with guys that give me the desperate vibe or if they like me too much too soon, I tend to be weary of them and stand-off-ish. Based on experience, both situations usually end fairly quickly. 

Instead of them taking things slow, getting to know someone, the good, the bad and taking into consideration what aspects of the relationship are compatible and not compatible, they get so excited and build this dream idea in their head of how great everything is, but after a while reality sets in. The reality that they ignored compatibility differences and end up realizing that we weren’t compatible. But because they act desperate or get excited too quick, they are emotional very early on and very fast, if I go along with it, I end up getting hurt. It’s like a fast burn situation, quick to light up but also fast to burn out. It’s a quick emotional roller coaster and those relationships are exhausting, usually not worth it. 

Once and a while they are worth it, so I try to slow things down, in case it does work out. I’ve had guys get mad at me bc I wasn’t as excited about the relationship as fast as they were, I just say I like them but I need to take it slow, I’ve literally been dumped bc of it. 

Within weeks I’ll have a guy tell me I’m the “one,” even though I know they are just overly excited and I try to ignore it, but a little part of me gets excited about the potential. But 90% of the time it crashes just as fast as it started and I get hurt/disappointed. 

In general bc of these personalities and my experience, I try not to get too invested too fast and I like to take things extra slow to protect myself emotionally.

In my opinion, being desperate isn’t what’s bad, to a certain extent we all are desperate for love and a good relationship, but what’s bad is the behaviors, lack of judgment bc they are so excited and the attitude that comes with desperation. If they are desperate, then in my mind they aren’t in the right mindset to make the healthiest decision, they might overlook crucial issues bc of desperation or they are into me too fast. Desperate humans aren’t known for making sound decisions, women notice that. 

Again, in my opinion, If he wants something serious, even though he may be overly excited or desperate, tell him to really slow things down, don’t let her see the desperation, it will make her feel more comfortable. If a women is looking for something serious, they want someone that takes their time, so no ones time is wasted. It takes months to know if people are even compatible, a couple weeks of talking daily isn’t enough, time is needed. Good relationships need time to experience different situations and time is needed to build the relationship. 

Sorry for the shitty grammar and shitty sentence structure, it’s late and I’m tired lol Hope this maybe gives you a different perspective on things."

And what I've noticed is that it may actually be in your best interest to be looking for something casual for the time being. Dating as an adult (as I've recently found out) is a lot different than dating as a highschool/college student. You don't have to be committed right away. It's totally fine to go on a bunch of dates with a bunch of different people and see if you find something you like. If you do find someone you're really interested in, and you hit it off really well, make sure it works out for a couple of months. Because the odds are, if they're willing to stick it out with you for a while, they may be interested in something long term. But you may find people that only realized they wanted something long term with you because you gave them the chance to come to that conclusion on their own (instead of bringing it up right away).

soc_1195557,socialskills,reddit_comment,166,"I mean... going by your description, is this person shy or someone with social anxiety or aspergers? Shy doesn't mean your social skills are trash. 

You're describing someone with severe social anxiety, not shyness.

But to answer your question, I'd act as I usually would around shy people. I prefer shy people because they aren't overbearingly loud and exhausting to be around. Don't get me wrong, confident people are good to have around to balance the social landscape, but shy people offer things they can't. Usually when you initiate conversations with shy people or include them in existing ones, they'll open up to you and let their personality flow.

EDIT: Although if the person has ALL the symptoms you described, I'd find them a little uncomfortable to be around. Going by experience, people like that make me feel like a fool when I'm desperately trying to get something out of them and they mumble without eye contact, repeatedly.

Once they share their part, I answer that same question and then let them get back to whatever they were doing. It varies a lot based on context and the situation given tbh and its hella hard to predict and have a clear script. You just have to go with the flow and make up as it goes. 

ONE THING IVE LEARNED - that i'll say for sure is that no matter of how much you converse with a girl, if she isnt interested in you, it likely wont go any further than just being friends. She has to find you or some quality about you (most say personality here) attractive for it to go any further. But MAKE THEM FRIENDS for now and practice your talking skills.      ----- &gt;&gt; A) This will get you confident in conversing with girls, B) you build up that rapport of having female friends that they can potentially set you up with someone OR that other females may see and perceive you as being cool with women that they automatically feel comfortable in approaching you or when you approach them and will warm up to you nicely. Trust me they don't warm up nicely to guys they think are creepy and will provide aloof or standoff-ish answers and just act uninterested. Yes, it HURTS when women friendzone you and you walk around with the hottest college/school girls only as your friends while they date some hot/muscular jock when you really wanted to date them, but use that friendship to your advantage to practice your social skills.

soc_1222171,socialskills,reddit_comment,350,"This is definitely a Cart Before the Horse Situation. And I want to give you props for doing all the right things to get connections going. Making contact. Initiating. Issuing invitations. Making suggestions. Reaching out. 

That's some major stuff that MANY people have trouble with! So congratulate yourself for having the motivation and energy to do that. It's half the battle.

The other half though is your own self-presentation. Unless you happen to have just asked the World's Busiest People, it seems likely that there's something about your approach that isn't as appealing as it could be. I can't tell you what from here, but SOMETHING.

So how to fix that? You have to look at what you bring to a social interaction. Unfortunately in this fast-paced modern life, just existing is not enough to earn you friends like back in the horse and buggy days. Now you have to bring something to the table that appeals to people or they'll just move on.

So I'd start with an acronym I call ECHO: Enthusiasm, Confidence, Humor and Optimism. These are traits that will make you very appealing to other people. Now most people don't have all four. In fact, just having one or two is enough to make people want you for a friend. 

This is of course assuming you have the basics down, like a friendly smile, decent eye contact, basic manners and an ability to carry a conversation. (You should deal with those separately if you have trouble in those areas.)

If you'd like to practice your social skills I suggest doing it in brief, low-stakes situations with people such as: grocery cashiers, gym attendants, coffee servers, bank tellers, mail carriers, store clerks etc. That's where you can work on your authentic smile (using your eyes) and an energetic greeting. Try to brighten someone's day, and learn how bringing positive emotions to others is CONTAGIOUS. If you practice bringing a playful attitude and some social energy to people, you'll be able to translate this to your social life. So start practicing, one interaction at a time.

Good luck!"

soc_1243934,socialskills,reddit_comment,195,"Yeh the essay wasn’t necessary it’s not that deep. I speak from a background of social anxiety. It’s something that’s still part of my life and dating is one of my biggest triggers. However, I’ve had success recently and it’s come primarily from removing the dichotomy out of my mind when it comes to speaking to girls. The “techniques” and tips they propose on that sub are horrendously cringey and won’t take you anywhere. It’s very cliche but the only way you will make a genuine connection and feel comfortable conversing is being true to yourself. Putting up some sort of facade and playing creepy mind games to “seduce girls” will not work in the long run. A better sub to look at would be this sub, dating or relationships. 
Yes I agree online dating doesn’t work for everyone but it is a good place to start if you are anxious to speak to girls in person hence why I suggested it. Again you’ve used the word “technique” which suggests your going about things the wrong way. There is no technique that can be applied to speaking to girls or people as everyone is different."
soc_880214,socialskills,reddit_comment,247,"so i’ll start by saying that i completely get where you’re coming from, i live with my mom and due to her MS she’s also extremely high risk &amp; would most likely die if she caught COVID.

1. something to always keep in mind is that you can’t control what anyone else does besides you, it’s your decision whether or not you want to still be friends
2. no good friend that knows you’re high risk should be trying to guilt trip you into seeing them, they’re supposed to be looking out for your best interest!
3. you’re overreacting just a little bit, and i only say this because you’re letting their actions (which you have no control over) decide how you’re feeling.
4. what i would try doing is letting your friends know, whether it be by post or PM, that you are high risk and will not tolerate people taking it less seriously while they are around you. if you’d like you can also choose to take a break from the friendship.

you have every right to be upset, but i feel you’re mainly hurt because you feel that your friends aren’t being considerate of your circumstances during the Pandemic. just keep in mind that while it isn’t right or fair, they most likely don’t know what it’s like to feel the weight of the world on their shoulders bc it would just be a bad case of the flu to them, not life threatening."
soc_111929,socialskills,reddit_comment,147,Everyone is different and has different needs and preferences. Everyone gets something different out of a friendship as well. I have some friends that are really great at being in a supportive role and others who are much better at being humorous. You don't really know what you'll be giving to someone else in a relationship so the best thing to do is just be yourself. Some people are going to like you and others are not. You can't please everyone all the time so it's best to just be the best you that you can possibly be and not stress as much over what others think of you. The best advice I can give you is that if one person calls you a duck then you can write them off but if 10 people tell you that you're a duck you better start looking for feathers.
soc_783483,socialskills,reddit_comment,267,"Naw you’re fine. This is exactly what this sub is for.

Bottom line: It depends on your morals, your opinions, etc. I can’t tell you what to value, just like you can’t tell me. If you value her empathy, then yeah what she’s doing is wrong. If not then it’s okay. The thing is, just like there are many branches of philosophy that tell you what is a moral and just way to live your life, there are many reasons to stay with or get rid of friends. At the end of the day it all comes down to you.

I personally think it’s wrong to infringe on other people’s freedoms. But you’d need to be a robot to never feel offended by what people are doing. That being said, I won’t hesitate to tell people how I feel. I’ll never tell them what they can and can’t do unless it directly affects my life, but I see nothing wrong with telling them how it makes me feel. The problem is that this can in turn make THEM feel a certain way and after that it’s just a cycle.

If you want my personal opinion, you have every right to be upset, but unless she’s obnoxious with how she gives him attention (talks about him to you or invites him to places with you etc) I wouldn’t bring it up. If she does do those things then I would bluntly tell her you think he’s a dick and don’t want to hear about him or see him around. If that offends her then there’s clearly an issue."
soc_286425,socialskills,reddit_comment,245,"I've noticed posts similar to this pop up pretty often and someone who is going through it also will comment in agreement. I thought I'd comment that everyone is on their own path. If you don't want to/or don't have interest in socializing then good for you. Who's to say what people should get better at. What's rewarding for me doesn't mean that everyone else should have the same goals or interests. The only thing that doesn't sit well with these posts is that if that is how you really feel, then why even post such a comment. Like if I tried programming and didn't like it, would I go on /programming and say 'I realized that I'm just not a programmer, I don't have any more interest in this' ...probably not, maybe but probably not. This is why I can't help but think that this is either a last call for help or if it's just an angst for someone to affirm their decision to quit working on social skills. And then when someone agrees, it's just what the doctor ordered. Maybe I'm way off, it just pops up often enough that it's an unusual pattern. I'll just say, keep at it...it'll be worth it. This isn't a half effort deal though, you really gotta be dedicated to plow through the rough patches. The only mistake you can make is giving up.

soc_1684546,socialskills,reddit_comment,196,"I had a very large friend group for many years and it fell apart during covid bc people didn't respect my boundaries and from there it just went downhill from there. Some people started dating that I knew wouldn't last so I peaced out and found a new friend on bumble and my bf almost at the same time which I needed so badly. I think you need to find someone who has a similar mindset to you and the same value of friendships there are those people out there. You have to go through some shitty ones to find them but they are there, it's up to you to be open to it and know that it may fail but it may not as well.

Normally I feel I would be judged by others about anything (Believe me on this, I was even, and still am a little afraid to go to the restroom in school due to my mind enlarging everything possible into doom-laden scenarios). 

The feeling of being judged comes from, I believe low self-esteem and trust issues (That's in my case and it can be different for you). Since they're your friends (I assume you used the word friend in a context of a person who cares about you and wants to help you and you want to help them) then they \*\*will not\*\* judge based on who you are especially it wasn't your choice to have SA and will do everything to help you if you explain to them how you feel, even if they don't fully understand this (It's hard to be in someone's shoes especially if someones' psychology is very different like it's hard for me to understand a person with depression or borderline personality)"
soc_1109729,socialskills,reddit_comment,769,"Hey bro,

I took a look at some of your comments on other posts and I can tell you right now that the problems you have today will persist well into your 30's, because you're mired in the victim mindset.

List after list after list of all the reasons you can't succeed, and then you drop a comment here just to name-call. 

Meanwhile, if you spent the same amount of time and money on your appearance that the women you want spend on their appearance, you'd do a lot better. And if you're not willing to put in that effort, you don't deserve the people who do. Full stop.

I was once in your shoes, at about the same age. But instead of whining, I studied book after book after book. I did exactly what I talk about in this post. I modeled what I say successful men doing. I never stopped searching for solutions. 

Those problems faded because my skills improved. You don't have one single problem that another man hasn't overcome by simply being persistent. So miss me with your bullshit.

If you don't think you belong where you are, then it's up to you to do something about it.

Here's a list of books to STUDY (ie. make notes, create flashcards, test in the outside world, read again six months to a year later, until you KNOW it):

Learning:

Make It Stick by Peter C Brown
Black Box Thinking by Matthew Syed - make a habit of writing down your mistakes
Simple Rules by Donald Sull
How To Measure Anything by Douglas Hubbard

Your world view is completely ineffective and that's why you don't get anywhere. These books will help you calibrate and learn to see the world for what it actually is.

Skill Building: 

Mindset by Carol Dweck
The Slight Edge by Jeff Olsen
Grit by Angela Duckworth
The Practicing Mind by Thomas Sterner
Fully Engaged by Thomas Sterner

These books will teach you how people go from 0 to 1 in skill, and eventually get really good.

Take Effective Action:

The Power of TED by David Emerald
Bulletproof Problem Solving by Charles Conn
12 Week Year by Brian Moran
Atomic Habits by James Clear
Vocal Power by Arthur Joseph
Models by Mark Manson (the best book there is on relating to women romantically)

Don't just read them, set them on the shelf, and wait for change to hit you. That's idiotic and will once again ensure that nothing will change.

STUDY THEM. Listen to the authors talk on YouTube or podcasts, try their ideas over and over, return to them. 

You'll come to realize that the reason some guys run circles around you is not because of your height, jawline, or whatever your latest misgiving is, but because you never built the skills that those guys have. 

I started on that journey without knowing where it would lead and now I'm where you want to be. You have the benefit of knowing where this journey leads.


Final words:

Drop the red pill bullshit. Most women will see right through it and bounce you out of their orbit with extreme prejudice, and your ego will just be more bruised.

Go to a counselor and tell them one of your goals is to build a healthy emotional life. It will help you connect to men and women. And since women are our culture's de facto therapists, emotionally-sound men are rare and attractive.

Study our ancestors. Before the agricultural revolution. That's the world we're wired for. Only read it/study it if it's published by a scientist. Text books are good.

Read the books that promote the skills you want to build. Usually, those books don't get major promotion and you'll have to seek them out. The more people circle-jerking over a book, the more likely it has a lot of marketing or name recognition behind it (Mark Manson's other books, Tim Ferris, on and on) and there are probably better options.


So yea, you didn't like my simple OP, so now you've got a complex post. Now if you **still** choose to ignore it, then we really don't have anything to talk about and for the third time, your life will look very similar ten years from now as it looks today. 

And to drive that point home even more, I bet your life looks pretty much the same as it did a year ago. Or even four years ago. 

Are you going to choose to be a powerful creator of your reality or are you simply going to float on the tide, wondering why you're powerless?"
soc_1071215,socialskills,reddit_comment,260,"Okay so... I’m sure you mean well. Here’s my personal perspective. 

If you’re a woman on the internet, there’s a high chance you’ve received dozens, if not hundreds of messages and invites from men you’ve never met irl. At first (when you’re 15), it might seem flattering, but over the years it gets annoying. Especially because many of these men will get sexually explicit very quickly. 

Now, I can’t speak for everyone, but if I have an unknown man in my inbox, my first instinct will always be an eyeroll and a ‘not another creep’. And that’s not saying that the guy might not be super nice! It’s just a reaction from all the crap my inbox has seen over the years. 

The good news is, I wouldn’t tell my friends about it, because it’s old news. The bad news is, I probably wouldn’t give you a chance. 

My advice would be to, wherever possible, not go the “slide into DMs” path, but if you do choose to do so, don’t do that to random girls you’ve never met. If it’s someone from your old school, you can maybe salvage the situation by actually starting the conversation on a common ground (hey, Facebook recommended you and I recognised you from school, so I got curious, how’s life treating you?) and seeking to connect on a personality basis, and not come on too strong. Unless I’m explicitly looking for someone to have sex with, I won’t be happy with someone randomly propositioning me. 

Buut, as I said, just my two cents."
soc_565850,socialskills,reddit_comment,426,"In my experience, there have been shifts in the dynamic.

For reference: 23F, married to a 24M, and I'm bi as hell, which I didnt realize until after we got married.

I've always been intimate with close friends. I'm a pretty heavy introvert, with a big circle of personal space, but when I have a very close friend, I like to snuggle with them. 

When my husband and I first started dating we were both pretty jealous and possessive, and that slowly receded over time when we developed and strengthened our relationship. We both have clear boundaries and are very open with eachother. This is VERY important. We try to be close with eachothers friends so we can be comfortable with the relationship. We're both friends with males and females. Since were both hella introverted, this standard isn't difficult. 

After I figured out I'm attracted to women, things got tense for a bit. My husband got a little uncomfortable with me hanging out with chicks just because he didn't know if this changed anything. But over time we both got comfortable again and it hasn't bothered either of us. 

These are standards we try to maintain so both of us feel safe and comfortable:

Were very open about how things make us feel, even if they're irrational feelings. 
We are open and receptive to the other person and don't put down their feelings.
We leave our social media and such open to the other person, although neither of us actually ever feel the need to check them. This was something that happened naturally, not after an issue.
If he is uncomfortable with how close I am to someone else, he is straightforward about it. Usually I dont give a shit cuz if were together I'd rather be snuggling with him anyway. Sometimes I snuggle with his best friend while he and his other best friend plays video games, but this is honestly just cuz were both cold as fuck all the time and our house is a freezer cuz my husband is a furnace. Sometimes he gets pouty about it, but he recognizes that and if he wants attention he just asks for it and I give it to him.

It's taken a few years to get to this point but the key is to be very open with your SO and your friend. I believe love is a choice you continue to make every day, and that it's up to you what kind of love you choose to have with friends, as well as intimacy. "
soc_1358746,socialskills,reddit_comment,147,"Maybe I’m missing the point here. A lot of these comments say you shouldn’t share similar experiences to try and relate because that’s perceived as making it about you. 

I understand if they’re not done sharing or venting that’s extremely frustrating to have a story derailed. But personally, I like to know that people have gone through similar things and will ask them to explain further if they don’t share what’s happened to them. 

Sometimes I ask if I just need to listen or if the person sharing wants advice. When I’m telling a story about something important to me or that has irritated me, the last thing I want my listener to say is “yeah that sucks” and then move on.

I think it’s a lot more personal preference than just making a blanket platitude of “don’t make it about you” would lead OP to believe."
soc_579718,socialskills,reddit_comment,260,"I find calls go better when I have an actual agenda, like I want to confirm dinner plans, I’m returning a call, need to check a fact, want to share some good news. Have a purpose for calling. That way if conversation lags, you can take it back to the reason you called. (“Anyway, just wanted to congratulate you on that award! See you tonight!”)

Keep it short and sweet. Start with a greeting. If you are friendly, maybe 30-60 seconds of small chat (“last time we spoke you had a cold. You sound better!” “Wow did you see the footage of the Notre Dame Fire? Unreal!”) Then get to the purpose of your call. (“So I really called because I wanted to confirm that your order for widgets was for 2,000, not 20,000. Am I wrong?” “Following up because I decided I could really use that book if you are still lending it.” “Wanted to check in and see how you are doing.”) let them answer and let them take the lead on this part of the convo. 

Once that is done, thank them for taking your call. They’ll them is was good chatting with them and you hope to talk to them soon. Say goodbye, then hang up. 

Start small and keep doing it, it gets easier with time. And even though I talk for a living, there are still phone convos that make me cringe - for some reason I hate ordering food on the phone. It makes me die inside! Thank god for Grubhub and Yelp!"
soc_1832476,socialskills,reddit_comment,243,"&gt;They're the ones not giving me a chance.

All those women complimenting you are giving you a chance that you shit on.

It sounds like the only thing that would be acceptable to you is a woman saying ""I saw you standing there, and I like this very non-visual thing about you. The way you blink. Yes the way you blink makes me want to come up to you and open a door, that way you can deliver your pick up line, and we can fuck. Also I just moved here from Mars so I have no other suitors so now is your chance.""

Until you admit that you don't know everything about women (and that internet people maybe DO know some things), and let go of your insecurity that's specific to women, you'll never get anywhere.

Being horny for two or twenty years is not justification for having illogical opinions. It is not logical to think most women have  surfeit of choice, that most women have unreasonably high standards, that most women never flirt with guys like you, that when most women compliment your outfit it can't possibly be a pickup line or a genuine compliment, that most women WAIT to be presented with fuck opportunities, and that most women are JUDGING you in a way that's special and different to how a man does.

WOMEN DON'T GATEKEEP SEX. SEX IS A MUTUAL DECISION, BOTH PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE THE GATE KEY."
soc_282470,socialskills,reddit_comment,173,"While much easier said than done, it is important to not compare yourself to others and ask questions when you need to. Instead of receding back into your head and jumping into flight mode, think of those social situations as a challenge, and a growing experience. Asking questions is the an excellent way to build a relationship with someone, and when approached with a smile, people can be very receptive. As someone who myself struggled in these situations, never being able to find solutions to my problems because I was too intimidated to ask, pushing yourself to reach out can be one of the best decision you ever make. Just ask me (ha ha)

In a friendship respect, you do not need to trust anyone right off the bat. Just because you don't trust someone, does not mean you can't have a relationship with them though. Trust needs to begin somewhere.

Everything begins with you, once you start to put in the effort to open up, the world may open up to you."

OP sounds like he did a lot of work to become a better version of himself, physically and mentally. Keep working on your health, your financial situation, your social life and your spiritual fulfillment. 

That’s called being on your path or on your purpose. And a woman should be an addition to your life, not a ball and chain. Which one of those she becomes is up to you, OP. Have clear, righteous boundaries and don’t be afraid to enforce them. Even it it feels like you risk losing her, it’s worth it. Women have no respect for a man they can walk all over. And that’s a far worse scenario than losing her because she’s mad that you didn’t allow her to make you unhappy. That’s not their job.

soc_854891,socialskills,reddit_comment,233,"On one end I think it’s great that you’re taking the time you feel you need, to yourself. Only YOU know what’s best for YOU. So, If you feel like you need time to get your head on straight, take it, by all means. 

When other people create expectations and time limits to what YOU need as an individual , that can add a level of stress you DO NOT need. Especially! In regards to mental health, feeling like you have to stretch yourself farther than you are capable to keep everyone happy. It weighs a ton. 

So to say “I don’t care how depressed you are...” in essence “make sure whatever you’re going through still includes me” sounds like an expectation you don’t have the energy to provide.

On the other hand, I can be hurtful to someone who does not understand where you are mentally, to feel left out in the cold.
It can be easily misunderstood as neglect or abandonment when the feelings aren’t 1) communicated and 2) heard. 

I think the friend needs to step out of a codependent perspective and realize you may actually be hurting and are in need of nurturing. Instead of it being the other way around. 

And you..making sure you are clear in communicating that YOU don’t have the capacity right now to nurture them in the mental space that you are currently in."
soc_1703994,socialskills,reddit_comment,166,"Based on your descriptions, the girl is very uncomfortable because she perceives you to be way out of her league (even if that's not the case from your point of view).

I think you recognized correctly that what would be needed is for you to make her feel *much* more comfortable being around you and with the idea of *being with you*. But unfortunately, if you don't possess that ability as of now, that's not something you can learn from a couple of comments here.   
No, I would not try to show up in places where she is more often if she already feel uncomfortable. If something feels manipulative, it's because it is. But hey, that's just my opinion. If you end up trusting your gut feeling anyway, it might ""work"", but possibly for the wrong reasons."

If everyone was in their 20's and working they'd each pay for themselves and split yours too, however at the age and affordability bracket you're in, you can't expect that.

Have honest conversations with them and just say you can't afford to pay for everyone and ask if they can pay for themselves, or at least part of it.

Either in a group chat or literally individually so you're not expecting them to say ""I'm too poor to come"" in the group chat.

soc_98657,socialskills,reddit_comment,267,"It depends on the person honestly. The subreddit itself is called /r/nonconformists, and caters to free-thinkers. It is not, I repeat, is not a ""skill based"" subreddit; **you wont be learning how to conform to the standard that has been set by your society; you will lean how to create your own standards, and be confident in your decision to do so.**

If you want to be normal, and if you want to be accepted by greater society at any cost, this would not be the right fit for you.  

But, if you are a bit odd, quirky, or awkward, and instead if conforming to what society wants you to be, you want to be happy with yourself, and who you have become...then the door is wide open, and waiting for you to walk through it.  

Most of the time, social skills boil down to confidence. A confidence person can walk into any room, and be accepted for who they are, without any awkwardness or misunderstandings. And even if they arent immediately welcomed,  everyone will begin to either 1) get out of their way or 2) accept them for who they are, and enjoy their presence.   

If you check out the subreddit, there are clear definitions of what a free thinker is, and what a nonconformist is. It is also a self-improvement subreddit, and as of now only welcomes self-posts [from everyone but mods] where people are free to ask for advice, and get feedback from the community.      

Either way, everyone's welcomed. If you dont like the feel, you can always press the back-button.

soc_234623,socialskills,reddit_comment,172,"You are still very young at 16. I have seen a lot of socially awkward penguins transform into socially charismatic gods in their twenties. 

I am not going to lie though, your lack of social situation does seem dire. The solution is simple yet extremely difficult. Go out and socialize. It's an extremely difficult task which is why you are going to have to approach this with baby steps. Different methods work for different people hence, I can't tell you what you have to do, you will have to figure out this yourself. Remember, go slow. You will fall and fail umpteen times but that's how we grow as a person. Embrace failure and enjoy success.

Seriously, I think you are worrying too much. There is still a lot of time for you to grow as a person. One more thing, I am not a psychiatrist, but it is always better to make sure you don't have any mental illness contributing to your problem, such as depression or social anxiety disorder .etc"
soc_1381614,socialskills,reddit_comment,203,"Everyone is different of course, but to people who view sex as a personal, intimate, and bonding experience, not just an activity for the sake of fun, sensual is what makes the act. It conveys the emotional intimacy so much more, which is what leads to more sex.

I think that in some cases, the difference in how people view sex is what causes issues in relationships. People who feel ready to go whenever, even without romantic feelings involved, seem to be unable to comprehend why their partner can't simply logically agree to drop their pants anytime as well. It's hard to bridge that gap, but where pushiness becomes too intense, it can also ironically lead to sex repulsion. 

My libido is low. Always has been. I enjoy sex when I want to have it, but I would also not be desperate to have it with anyone else, if I was single. But what I say has been a consistent pattern for me, is I definitely want to have sex more if EMOTIONAL intimacy is actively present. My personal theory is that many couples lose it from lack of work put into maintaining it, which why there are sex-oriented problems in many relationships."

as other people said there's the possibility she has a crush on you and there's alot of reasons why she may act the way she does because of that. she might be insecure to the point where any implication of intimacy shuts her down so she's preventing that. she may just be annoyed that she has a crush but is not interested in a relationship or whatever. not much you could do to fix it i'm afraid."
soc_851541,socialskills,reddit_comment,711,"... then I recommend six courses of action and in THIS order:

1. Stop worrying about when Mr. Right is going to come along because HE is out there waiting for YOU to find yourself and learn how to love YOU before HE can do so. Got all that? OK cool... please keep reading because we have to go down a few back-roads to get you to the 'main road."" 

2. Again... focus on you FIRST and guys a little later for now. It is imperative that you stop... and re-acquaint yourself with the woman, person and individual inside.

3. From there you must do any and everything things that honestly, very truly and genuinely make YOU happy.  Yes I am serious. Make changes and improvements to the way you think and view yourself; your approach to life, education level and appearance for YOUR benefit and YOUR benefit only. YOU have to like the way you think... YOU have to like the way you feel... YOU have to like the way you carry and present yourself when meeting others... and YOU have to like what you see in the mirror as well as the figure and clothing that person in the mirror is wearing... and YOU have to know if/when you need help and advice from mom, a girlfriend, a hairstylist, trainer or life coach to help you get to that person inside that you want to reflect on the outside. You HAVE to put in the work and invest some time, energy and effort on YOU... but none of this means a thing 
if you don't do it for YOU and you alone. You cannot do all of this stuff just to attract a guy. There absolutely HAS to be a self-love component attached to each and every piece of work and effort you put in to improving certain things about yourself. You should not, cannot and MUST not do all these things just to attract a guy because loneliness, desperation and vulnerability WITHOUT self-esteem is a recipe for attracting the WRONG type of guy! This is how women like yourself wind up with liars, cheaters, users and abusers... and I honestly do NOT want you to become one of the lonely, desperate and vulnerable women who attract these type of men... and you stand a MUCH better chance of attracting the right type of guy if you are truly able to live and exude a certain level of self-esteem and confidence, and it has to genuine and REAL.


4. You have got to learn that a happy life is only partially... but not totally and entirely... about how much others like YOU... but it's also about your right to be selective about those you want (or think you need) as part of your life and IN your life and know that there is a distinct difference between the two. Get my drift? Build that self-love, self-esteem because this is where your powers of attraction are.  

5. What are your standards when it comes to guys? Do you have certain personality, physical feature and professional attributes in mind? Are your standards reasonable, realistic and in line with who you are INSIDE and what you believe you have to bring to a relationship? Have you developed your own ""weeding list"" to flag losers? lol You cannot be afraid to have 'standards' of your own because YOU must always be aware of the kind of guy that deserves YOU and what YOU have to offer. Have you sat down and spoken with another woman and maybe even a brother or male relative to obtain other perspectives, and if not, maybe you should do so.

6. Go down this list of YouTube links shown below and pick something... anything... and listen. I mean honestly and truly LISTEN and learn, and I want you to also make it a point to listen to Whitney Houston's song ""The Greatest Love of All"" which is on the lower end of the list as well. Make it a point to listen to the all of the lyrics very, very carefully.

So it can feel a bit empty hanging out with them, because they're.more looking for someone,rather than being interested in you specifically. It seems like you're someone who is comfortable with being alone, and that's a skill you'll always need in life. If I were you, I'd ask myself what this friend adds to my life. Not in an angry or judging way, just be like "" is this really worth my time?""  You said she's given you more opportunities to go out and socialize,which is good. However her forgetting you from memories, or suggesting a song she got from you, is hurting your self esteem. Nobody likes to bond with someone who then forgets them. So it's up to you to decide if this friendship is impacting your life more positively or negatively. I'd maybe also wanna know why she's like this, why she started hanging out with you in the first place?"
soc_1790077,socialskills,reddit_comment,146,"It's definitely not a bad sign. First of all, I wanna say that you are a good friend❤️. I'm the same way as your friend and I could say that if she agrees to hang out 90% of the time, she definitely likes hanging out w you. Maybe she doesn't initiate because she herself doesn't go out that much; or she doesn't want to bother you; or she have financial issues (which I can relate to). I know that you feel like she doesn't contribute much on the friendship or she doesn't reciprocate your efforts. It's valid to feel that way.

My advice is tell her about how you feel. Tell her about how you feel like your efforts aren't reciprocated. Guilt trip her, tell her that maybe she doesn't really wanna be friends w you (super effective LMAOO🤣). Maybe she could understand that and change."

What you have to understand is that you'll still be shy but you know for a fact you won't see these people again and that no one has expectations about you. The hardest part is not being there but comming back. If it works well and you think you've acted better while away, you can ride the wave for a bit longer while at home.

I finally came to the conclusion that feeling like people don’t like me all the time isn’t compatible with a happy life, so I decided to work on myself.  I’m no expert for sure but I think you need to decide how you want your life to be and then work towards that.  Know you’re worth being around and cultivate relationships with people who are positive and who you enjoy being around, and people you can give something to as well.  A good relationship should have some give and take.  I’m slowly trying to do this and I’ve seen some positive changes.  But it’s definitely not been easy.  It takes a lot of work.

1) unengaged with social media for reasons that they are shy, lack confidence, or simply not the kinds of people to post stuff online. Some friends I have hate posting selfies and barely post at all because they don't like the way they look. I have a friend like this who has said before she won't post because she gets anxious about a post not getting likes etc. 
2) The people who are interesting and confident in themselves to not bother posting much at all especially of themselves because they don't need compliments, and don't really care for social media. My friend is absolutely stunning, could get a million likes for just how she looks and I asked how why she doesn't post selfies and she simply said
""I don't care,"" 

I personally used to post none, got more confidence I suppose and started posting more photos of myself online. However, deep down I think I am still looking for that reassurance I am accepted, people like me etc through likes and comments. I think there was a study a while ago that said every like is just another release of dopamine in the brain, exactly how eating chocolate or sex makes you feel.

Edit: Format"
soc_1569570,socialskills,reddit_comment,905,"I can think of a few reasons as to why someone would immediately dismiss anyone that has done them wrong, even if just one time.

You used the words **usually** and **rarely**, so there are exceptions? And if so, to who? Intimate partner? Friends? Family?

If there are no exceptions, and the words **usually** and **rarely** are meant to be **every time** and **never** then I think not discussing things, **ever**, is a bad thing.

Communication is a complex task and, listening to another person with whom we might disagree is very hard and complicated. Also, we (as people) are stupid so there are misunderstandings happening all the time. If a person that's involved in an interaction decides to simply leave the situation, the opportunity to maybe learn something will leave with that behaviour.

&amp;#x200B;

***Warning***: I will try to challenge some of your beliefs. Up to you to read, think and engage or simply ignore.

&amp;#x200B;

To start off, question. What do you mean your ego is too big to waste your energy arguing with someone?

""...to show them that they worth my time after what they did"" But... according to what you wrote first, you **rarely** discuss the reasons as to why you're ignoring them. How can they know what they might have done if you don't tell them? People can't read minds.

Giving other people time is showing them that you care. If you purposely don't give them time it is showing you don't care if they just disappear, which is totally fine. We all have people we work well with and others that we don't.

\--------------------------------------------------------

""Me ignoring them is the best punishment and it drives them nuts and they often appear foolish.""

How do you infer that it drives them ""nuts"" and they ""often appear foolish""? Do they tell you how they feel, or is it because they tend to act aggravated that you think they are ""nuts""? And how can you know they appear foolish? Have you thought about the possibility that they might just appear that way to you?

AND, why is it important to you to punish them? You are essentially acting in a passive-aggressive manner because it's clearly important to you that they suffer because of what they might have done to you. This is the definition of passive-aggressiveness, where you are expressing, what I think is anger and revolt, without directly communicating. So, I'm afraid you are not simply ignoring them.

Also, going back to the second paragraph you wrote, I think you are somewhat rejecting yourself.

""Or when someone is often argumentative, acts **passive-agressive** or **defensive** I don't respond with anything and, again I cut them off and I **ignore them**""

For example, can you see a way of you firstly acting defensively towards some comment that's made, which will then make you resent the person that made it, which will lead to you acting passive-aggressively towards them which will make you into the sort of person that you, yourself ignore?

Furthermore, thinking about someone and purposely thinking of ways to make their lives better or worse implies that you care about them and that you are not just okay ignoring them completely.

\--------------------------------------------------------

In addition, you wrote that you don't see the point of arguing. I think it depends on the situation (not being abused/explored, not letting something in your circle of friends go by that you don't agree with, like bullying others, etc), but almost always there is an opportunity to learn something that might be useful. That's the point of arguing to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I assume you were asking this in the context of colleague's/friends conversations. With that in mind, I don't like to think of a **conversation** where two people disagree on something as **arguing.** To me, arguing is when people start raising their voices, they start looking for ways to put the other down with personal attacks, and they might even bring past events to criticise them on their character in order to put the *opposing* *party* down and win the ""argument"" as if they were discussing *politics.* Basically, I think that if people are arguing they are most likely not going to learn much, and if they do learn, it will probably be through regret of their actions after the heat has gone down (after a few hours/days/weeks).

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, I can see that your ego is certainly big because you seem to mainly care about your appearance to others, and not yourself.

""I started to think **if I appear** to be weak/coward??!""

Do you care if you appear to be weak or a coward? Or do you actually feel weak and like a coward? Try to be aware of the possible conflation between what you feel like and what your ego tells you about how you feel.

&amp;#x200B;

Have you posted this, I think you might want some advice. I would say if you manage to get past your ego, see if you actually feel weak after acting in the way you've been acting, and you will have your answer.

If you do feel weak, I think you should look into a way to change your behaviours because you won't respect yourself if you don't. If, however, you get past your ego and you don't feel weak, it means that those concerns are only coming from your ego (head), which is possibly too active."

You don't want her to see you staring at her like a creep every time you look over. Make it happen on occasion and keep it mysterious. Keep your face neutral and when your eyes meet give a quick smile to show friendliness and acknowledgement.

Usually I talk to people about their hobbies and interests, starting the conversation off casually, in my case, telling them about a painting I’ve been working on or a movie I just watched,

Other times I’ll talk about a book I’m interested in or am currently reading

Sometimes I talk about philosophy, psychology and biology and just my opinion on random thoughts I’ve been having and ask for their impute and it can really get an interesting conversation going

I’ll also give movie and music recommendations and it’s a good way to really get to know someone. I find that music taste really says a lot about someone

Overall I just talk about my interests and hope the other person is interested as well, if not, well, I guess there wasn’t a point talking if we didn’t have much in common.

soc_1618831,socialskills,reddit_comment,176,"I am assuming you struggle to strike up a conversation because you try too hard to think of the most specific and ""best"" way to find a topic. Let that go and say anything random, whether it's someone's outfit, a random object that reminded you of something, or anything else. Say it, any words that are being said can have a follow up. 

If you see someone wearing shoes you find nice, don't just compliment it and call it over. Although it is a step to make friends since people will feel more comfortable are happier with you that you complimented them, it still will not guarantee a conversation. Ask them where they get it from, tell them your experience with those shoes, tell them your genuine opinion of those shoes from any aspect. 

And if you do that and people still don't say anything, then it's okay. It's not you, sometimes people don't know what else to say for whatever reason. Everyone is different and that's why it's best to practice this with multiple people."

Right now it sounds like you're placing a lot of your self-worth into how these people view you.  NOT HEALTHY.

You need to start talking to yourself differently.  You need to tell yourself that your worth is NOT based off of what anyone else thinks of you, and then go out and live it.  Do things for yourself.  Do things for other people.  Pick a day and go find some activities that you would NEVER normally do otherwise.  Get out of your fucking comfort zone!  Get better at your hobbies.  Be a better boyfriend.  Having zero idea of what to do is the PERFECT place to be because it means you can do ANYTHING.

I have a voice in the back of my mind that calls bullshit on me whenever I would complain or whine or feel bad about myself, because I knew that I wasn't really making the effort to fix my own problem.  YOU HAVE TO FIX YOUR OWN PROBLEMS.  You're not respected the way you want to be?  Take a step back... are my flatmates douche bags or am I the one who's awkward and not all that fun or adventurous?  Be honest with yourself.  Be brutal.  Then go fucking fix it and stop whining.

That's harsh, but I hope I have shown you that it's not coming from a place of anger or contempt towards you - this is what worked for me.  Practice ignoring your stupid brain when it tells you all this negative stuff.  STUPID BRAIN.  If your friends are dicks, drop them.

soc_208520,socialskills,reddit_comment,235,"Other commenters have pointed out one effect of too much niceness (an insincere vibe), so I'd like to focus on another one: a lack of confidence.

This resembles what you wrote regarding social status, but I'm not a fan of the alpha male philosophy and all that talk about being a person of high value, so those are not words I use.

Always being available and nice does create an unequal relationship dynamic, though. It gives off the impression that you are there *for* others instead of spending time *with* them. A thought experiment: who seems like the cooler person? Someone who doesn't have much time because they are always doing fun stuff or meeting up with others or someone who is always available because they're sitting at home 24/7? Who is more confident? Whom would others rather spend time with?

Now, some will argue they don't want to uphold a facade of popularity because that's insincere, and they are right. That's not what this is about, though. It's about making yourself your own priority. What's your life about? About your hobbies, your development and your needs. Others are welcome to share those, but you don't have to adapt to other people's preferences all the time. Tip the balance a couple of nudges in favour of *your* interests. How you want this balance to look like is your decision, at the end of the day."
soc_198086,socialskills,reddit_comment,238,"The thing about being different, is that it's ENTIRELY subjective. Different-good = unique. Different-bad = weird. Whichever one you want to be is up to you. 

The short answer here is: You rely on your talent to gain respect. Find something else.

It's like that rich kid in school who only has friends because his parents buy him cool stuff all the time. They're only around because of his stuff. Once his stuff is gone, so are his friends. Poof! You don't want to be the kid with rich parents. You want to be the poor kid who still has a ton of friends because he's a cool guy. Relatable. No Hindenburg like ego to enflame. Be the poor kid, so that when your talents naturally and organically show themselves, people are awed instead of jealous. They already like and respect you for your personality. The talent will simply become a bonus. 

When you solely rely on talent to gain respect, the second it's gone, you're friends (who value you, but only for that talent) will disappear too. Rely on your personality instead. Unless you or they undergo a huge personality change, you'll be safe and sound. You can fail assignments all you want. Flunk out of school for all they care. That's not why they're your friend. 

Your utility shouldn't only be on the business plans you provide. Root it in something that's less prone to failure. 
"
soc_360656,socialskills,reddit_comment,366,"I agree with this but would say that you can get to the point where awkwardness disappears regardless if who you are with or circumstance. Awkwardness happens when you are attached to an outcome in the social interaction. If you want to not be seen as weird, that fear will permeate into your behavior and you will take away the cognitive function that allows for smooth interactions. When you fear loss, loss manifests.

So...do not worry about anything and start speaking regardless of what you think, this exercise will show you people are worried about what they are doing, and you will lose this fear in time. Make mistakes, it becomes fun to do so actually as a little engineered tension makes things fun.

It IS natural to have silence, and eventually you will realize that it is weird to constantly talk and not have silences, indeed they are necessary as conversations carry on. Things are communicated in silence, it is an action that speaks loudly and is part of a fluid interaction. That being said we all are at our own social levels and social intelligence is the ability to interact with others harmoniously, and if you are around someone who cannot handle silence, then It is up to you to bridge the gap and speak, or to let them squirm (but that wouldn’t be harmonious) Everyone is lost in their heads and fears and you can rise above that by realizing that it really doesn’t matter, and only presents a problem when you let it. That anxiety of the desired outcome will cause tension that the silence will show. That is how awkwardness happens. If you feel uncomfortable around someone, it is either your anxiety, or theirs. Either way it doesn’t matter, and when you can believe that social interactions are truly enjoyable. 😄 best of luck to you, the people around you just want you to be yourself and speak from you perspective, unfiltered but tactful. Throw yourself out there and watch as people not only catch you but lift you up to continue being yourself. Everyone wants this from you and from themselves and you can show them how it is done."
soc_265152,socialskills,reddit_comment,394,"Well, since I'm in a classroom setting for a small part of the day I'm surrounded by potential friends and acquaintances but my internal filter is too much for myself to break through. The filter isn't only up when trying to socialize but also speaking up in class even though I know the material. The professors also realize this and tell me to speak up more. I wish it were always as easy as it sounds. 

Usually when I want to say something I think it over a few times because I have a habit of being very particular about the words I choose when speaking or writing. I don't want there to be any ambiguity about the point I'm trying to convey. I realized that my tendency to over analyze my word choice was holding me back from participating socially. It's difficult but this week I'm actively trying not to over think my responses. Obviously, I'm not going to say the first thing that comes to mind lol However, I'm just going to think about it once and just go with it and see what happens. I still caught myself over thinking today but I think finding the right balance will come with time. I already befriended someone new today thanks to not over thinking. Normally I wouldn't ask people where they were headed after class, I just talking to them if they happen to walk the same direction. Today was different. I decided to actively pursue some sort of friendship and asked a girl from the group we were assigned today which way she was heading and if I could walk with her. She said yes. 

We talked a bit and I bought us some donuts. We happened to click pretty good. We have similar sarcastic humor and both are a bit of loners. Will hang out again, and honestly I don't care if she isn't looking for a relationship, it was pleasant to have a friend to chat with. Tomorrow I'm going to try to talk to a complete stranger and not someone from class. I'm not sure how I will approach the situation but I at least have to try.

If you don't care what these people think, and believe that they might agree with the person ranting... Why do you care about making a certain impression? Just move on with your life."

I was super unsure of starting medication because I thought that maybe I was just overreacting or that I needed to make other lifestyle changes before trying the medication. But the truth is my anxiety and social anxiety were so bad that I couldn't make these changes, because my body would just feel everything so intensely and I was just too uncomfortable all the time to even walk to the gym or go grocery shopping. Once I started medications all these things stopped being a big deal."
soc_542193,socialskills,reddit_comment,232,"You can’t force someone to accept you’re point of view. In doing so, you’ll actually just push them away even further. Some people don’t want to understand, and it should just be left there. 

On the other side of the coin, have you ever tried to understand their point of view? Have you ever asked them why they view it that way, think that way? How they come to such a conclusion? Has it been a conversation of curiosity on your side, or a conversation of almost trying to say you’re viewpoint is right and there’s is wrong? Because there is no such thing. People live life how they want to live it, and that’s liberating when you realise you have no control over it, so you just focus on yourself. What they view is right to them. You might think it’s wrong and vice versa, but neither party has the right to dictate and determine what is right or wrong. That completely personal and subjective to the individual. So if you want to discuss different viewpoints, do it in a place of curiosity, but you have nothing to prove when explaining your side. And no reason to justify it either. If they ask to understand, great, if they don’t, it doesn’t matter. If that’s what you feel, if you’re happy with it, it doesn’t matter. You just carry on being you."
soc_202373,socialskills,reddit_comment,173,"People talk to other people all the time without establishing a life-long friendship.  I'm not sure why you seem to be investing a bit of polite conversation with the responsibility of being a parent to the guy.

Not liking someone because they have a juvenile sense of humor, act very nervous, and stand too close to one's s.o. is perfectly fine.  You can not like someone for any reason.  OP is trying to find a way to tactfully disengage (at least a bit) from this uncomfortable person, which I think is more than a lot of people would do.

Life is too short to try to hammer an awful fit between two people into a friendship.  I suggest OP find people more compatible, and strike up friendships with them.

If you choose to invest tons of time into someone, that's your choice, but people aren't obligated to give over their lives to train the socially awkward.  There is tons of material on the internet, and classes, for those who need better social skills."
soc_1001860,socialskills,reddit_comment,202,"There is an aspect of 'I suffer in a way that others don't understand' but I think the recognition that no suffering can be compared is a good thing to do I suppose. 
I have adhd and sad! None of my family members have these conditions! But my sister has chronic fatigue and minieres so knows what it's like feeling behind! Being able to whine about your problems with others is a great part of life. 

That being said, letting go of ego is actually a pretty good way to say it in that it's not your confidence, but your *need* to be confident in yourself. 

You don't need to make others fully understand the extent of which you suffer, because they never will! They aren't in your shoes! You don't need to be right all the time! It's okay to concede and recognise when you're wrong! It shows that you are able to grow as a person to others, and makes you feel good as well, because you don't feel that tense feeling of defensiveness. 

It's okay to recognise that everyone is different, and suffers differently. It doesn't invalidate your suffering, it makes others easier to reach out to for comfort."
soc_945145,socialskills,reddit_comment,185,"Another question to ask yourself - why should you laugh at people who mess themselves up?  There are any number of other reactions people have, like: secondhand embarrassment, anger, compassion, rueful shake of the head, to name a few.  Obviously, some are more appropriate than others.  

I know it feels like you can't help your personal reaction.  Still, you learned this particular one as opposed to all the others somehow.  Therefore, you can unlearn and/or replace it.  Try to really examine your emotions and thoughts in the moment when this happens.  If you can trace out the connections which lead you from 'someone messed up' to 'ha-ha!', you'll have a much better understanding of how to change it.  

Just as one possible example, it could go: low self-esteem on your part, fear of messing up yourself, seeing other people do it gives you relief from that fear, so the laughter is the involuntary laughter of relief.  In that case, working on your underlying fear will solve the problem.  But there are many other possibilities, so only you can figure out what it is for you."

soc_800867,socialskills,reddit_comment,270,"I know this is going to sound cheesy but you’re not going to be able to have a proper relationship if you don’t love yourself first. Hooking up is another matter, but I wouldn’t focus on finding a relationship until you’ve worked on your own confidence and self-love first. 

Joining clubs, finding a job, and chatting with classmates are all good suggestions for meeting people. If you get to know one person really well then they can introduce you to their friends (quality over quantity). But I agree with other people about going into it with the mindset of making friends- don’t go into your school activities and talk to girls with the expectation of a relationship. 

If you are really looking to date, consider a dating app. Personally I’m a girl with social anxiety and had no luck with dating guys I met irl because I always felt like it would be awkward to start that ball rolling. But dating apps worked surprisingly well because you’re both going into it with the idea of some sort of relationship. You can basically pick a person you think you’d get along with and then spend an evening with them that decides if you want to get to know them more. You can kind of skip the part where you have to get to know them enough to ask them to hang out, and go straight to the hanging out itself. Ofc this is just my opinion, but I ended up meeting some guys who were interested in a relationship and I even got a really good friend from this. 

Good luck!"
soc_546216,socialskills,reddit_comment,497,"Lol sorry I couldn’t help but laugh 😂. Yea I’ve always done that though I don’t necessarily think of it as a bad thing. 80% of human communication is nonverbal so you can learn a lot about someone or even like about the culture of a new country if you’re traveling. Ive always called it people watching and it’s my favorite past time activity. I’ve always found people fascinating from a psychological point as well. Which sometimes means I might know something about someone before they do and if I point that out it normally pisses them off or in rare situations (haha) it’s been beneficial so don’t necessarily do that if you’re looking for friends or I suppose choose your words wiser if you see something. I’m more confrontational than most, most would say. 
 
Now if you want to get into why I people watch.... I dono tbh I find most people boring (which I’m aware sounds arrogant) and it’s more entertaining just becoming.. ehh  I wanna say a good word is aware of everyone. For me if I’m out in public I’m out on a mission, i know exactly what im looking for and where it is and being aware of people let’s me navigate through unaware people (the majority) who walk around stupidly and it just pisses me off endlessly, like Jesus fucking Christ walk at a constant speed, don’t take up the entire walkway, and if possible walk in a relatively straight line. I HATE simple inefficiencies. Anyway... 

I guess the question is why do you see it as an issue; why do you think that makes you a creep? And why do you relate people watching with your issues making friends. And continue to ask why to those answers and eventually you’ll get to a core reason. 

How I see it tbh, and my logic. Observation is for most people a fairly chill and  undetectable  to everyone around you. I mean your just looking around that’s a normal human behavior. No one is looking at you assuming that you’re watching them unless like you’re dead on staring at them... then yea... that’s your issue or at least a big obstacle. So then assuming you’re not just staring at people it kinda shows that it’s more that your issues talking to people is something not that. Logical answer is self Esteem issues/ maybe mental health issues (which i say because I’m bipolar with ptsd which I’ve had for a loooong time) maybe both. Probably more so self esteem if you’re young. 
I use to care what people thought/think of me for a long time but i realized that no matter what you do people are going to judge or not approve if you do or don’t do might as well live for yourself or if you’re not fucking and they don’t sign your paycheck their opinions of you shouldn’t hit you emotionally. That’s helped me though everyone is different.

soc_1168941,socialskills,reddit_comment,191,"I think I have a really easy solution. Karaoke! Usually most cities have karaoke bars, or bars that offer it, and there are usually a close knit group of people. They usually are open and welcoming to new people. 

So, your strategy is simple, go to karaoke night to a bar you feel comfortable with. When you are singing, sing your best. When someone else is on stage watch the singer; enjoy the song and the applaud thankfully. If they are bad or really bad you can smile or chuckle a little, but in the end applaud thankfully. 

When no one is on stage, sit at the bar, make friends with the staff and look at the list to prepare for the next song you want to sing. 

You are a woman so people will be coming up to you to meet you handle them how you want  (""I'm not in a place to start a relationship right now""). Buy you will start to see the same faces over and over again. This is should be easy to start real friendships in the groups you meet.

Ultimately, have fun and enjoy."
soc_250317,socialskills,reddit_comment,389,"I'm not going to tell you you're wrong, and your perceptions aren't valid or true. I simply gave you my experiences coming from an identical situation as yours. I am much happier now being friends with absolutely everyone I can. Doesn't mean I hang out with them all regularly, but I give everyone a shot. Heck, I danced at a gay club last night (I'm not gay at all) and it was one of the best times of my life. The gay black dude twerking was an absolutely awesome dude. We're getting coffee later to talk about how he devotes his time to a charity that works to reform the school system to educate minorities more equally. Super noble and interesting stuff. If I judged him based on one instance of him letting loose twerking on a Saturday night I would have missed out on a cool human being.

So no, don't show me videos. There's always going to be seemingly stupid or silly people. At the end of the day, you're missing out by judging them, not them. They're probably fine. And you're the one making a post about not being happy, not them. Seems harsh, but I've been down this road and realized I was the one with the problem, not others. 

Edit: to prove my point. What do you know about the possibly gay black dude? You don't even know if he's actually gay or not. Do you know what he wants to do after high school? What his family is like? What he is passionate about? Sounds like you might think you know him without actually knowing him at all.

Also, I'd recommend you watch the movie Charlie Bartlett. That opened me up a lot. Made me realize everyone is broken, including myself. What makes people popular after high school is being a great friend. One that would do almost anything to help others. You can get a jump start on that now and you'll be killing the game.

But hey, you don't have to listen to anything I said or change your mind. I don't care. Just trying to help teach you lessons I wished I knew at that age. I literally went from the most unpopular ""weird"" kid in high school to being one of the most respected public figures in my city. "

soc_973064,socialskills,reddit_comment,362,"It really depends on the person. You might just not be a priority in that person's life. Maybe they have kids, a significant other, a busy work life, lots of other close friends. Whatever it is, you might just not be near the top of their list of priorities. Or maybe they're not busy at all. Maybe they're just not the type of person that likes to talk all the time. Maybe you feel the need to talk more than they do and however often you text them is enough for them to feel like you two are connecting.

Whatever the reason, it can be ok. Or maybe it isn't, that's up to you to decide. I think it just depends on your relationship with this person. Are they a boyfriend/girlfriend? Best friend? Friend? Potential friend? Family member? Maybe you could bring this up to them in a calm and open way and ask why they don't text you first?

Maybe you just have to lower your expectations of the relationship. Maybe you want to be best friends with this person but they only see you as a casual friend that they talk to every now and then. Or maybe this person is a significant other and they're not meeting your need for communication. In that case, you need to discuss it with them and come to an agreement, or possibly break up.

On the flip side, this person could be absolutely over the moon every time you text them and might just be too afraid to text you first. Maybe they're afraid of rejection, have low self-esteem, are depressed. There could be any number of reasons why they don't text first. And unless you know the person very very well, it's not necessarily that easy to know whether or not any of these are the reason.

My recommendation:
Communicate it with them. There's no point asking other people why someone else does something. Only that person knows why (and sometimes they don't even know). Just try not to do it in an accusatory way. Try to come at it from a place of love and understanding.

People normally don't say things like ""weird, awkward or annoying"" straight into other peoples faces. Most are too afraid to do that. It is also super rude :)

no, you totally dont! it makes it a little easier, but all the important things happen in real life anyway and social media is just a more cool way to waste your time than gaming or watching tv

source: used to be a fat loner, worked on myself, no longer fat and probably one of the three most popular kids in my year (senior - school starting tomorrow)

just be kind to everybody, make everybody feel the way you want to feel, and eventually people will literally come up to you to be your friend because you are just being kind to everybody

wont get you laid tho, but the gym helps a lot on that point

as a piece of advice: pick one or two popular kids (not the super popular but you do probably know which kind of person i mean) and become friends with them, and use them to meet new people (their friends, do things together) etcetc

did that, and just had the most awesome summer holidays of my life, in the 2 months ive maybe spend 7 nights at home and all the other time partying/hanging out/meeting girls (still working on that tho, im just really good at making female friends but i guess its just another skill you can learn)

It feels like you might be afraid someone will be better than you at something or take away a part of you by sharing that interest, when in reality most people would love it to have friends finding new and similar interests. I get the idea that you can be very jealous of people, and take that out on them secretly. Anger is a secondary emotion. It doesn't just sprout from nothing, so it's up to you to figure out why you feel that way, even if it's a tough question to ask yourself.

Right now the behaviors you've described are very toxic. I think it's definitely important that you begin to shift your thought over to reality some. Why can't you enjoy something with someone else? What would you like the others around you to do and why do you want them to do it? Should they?

soc_916890,socialskills,reddit_comment,406,"Do you watch any crime dramas?  It might help you to look at conversation as a clue-finding exercise.  Take the example you've given - the other person just responded with the statement they went to the pool yesterday.  In a crime drama, the investigator would seize on this to ask follow-up questions.

So ask yourself, what is the significance of this fact?  Obviously, you're not actually looking for clues that your potential friend committed a murder, but you no more know what the relevance of the pool is to them than that investigator.  You need to ask questions to find out what that is, and you need to build up trust with people before they will really open up to you.  You cannot demand their trust by screaming at them to talk to you - they will just shut off.  Examples of questions of this type:  Do you go there often?  Do you enjoy swimming?  Did you go by yourself or with someone?  Do you prefer the pool or the beach?  (Notice the emotion words like ""enjoy,"" or opinion-eliciting words like ""prefer"" - they will get you beyond dry facts the quickest). 

Notice that a good investigator will often relate what the other person said to some kind of personal statement, as this builds rapport.  This works very well in real life also.  Examples:  ""Oh yeah?  I like swimming, too, but I haven't had enough time to go recently.""  Or if you don't like swimming, ""Not my thing, but sounds like it was fun for you.""  Or if you have some brief personal story, ""One time, our family went to the pool and this funny/nearly tragic/weird thing happened...""  (Another point of doing this is that if you never let the other person know how you feel about what they said, they will feel mistrusted and shut out by you.  This is the reason people don't enjoy talking to you.)

You will have to do some hard work to overcome your bad habits.  Above all, zoned out is an awful attitude to take when you're having a conversation.  People notice when you're not actually interested in them.  You have to pay attention and process what they say.  Set your dreams of bantering aside for later; you have a lot of building blocks to set up first before you can banter.  Successful bantering *relies* on being keyed in to people, even more than the above basic conversational steps."
soc_331935,socialskills,reddit_comment,363,"OP, I'm going to try again.  I thought about it more.  Your problem resonates with me because I have this with some people.  The instances I have of this are only with some people, but it bugs me big time.

I feel these people will never know the real me.  I don't show the real me because of previous rejection/trauma.  Are you protecting yourself by keeping yourself cut off in some way?  Almost certainly.

I'm still working through it and am in therapy.  My therapist would probably tell you there's nothing wrong with trying to protect yourself (based on your past, which only you know, maybe this is reasonable?  In my case, I grew up in a very tense family, eggshell walking or someone's going to blow, more chronic weird shit and neglect, don't know if you have that).

There was some doubt about these people to begin with.  But I see clearly that it's all one-sided and on me.
Sometimes other people are shy and I'm insecure.  It's been nine years and I still haven't been able to feel like I'm friends, real friends, with these people.  It's like there's no bond.

Can you invite them to something like an activity where maybe you'll bond?  Like a board game store board game night or minigolf or Escape the Room or something?  Is that too cheesey?

Should you cut your losses and try to meet new people?
Honestly, I guess I'm doing that with a couple people.

One person, I'm trying not to see for a year (almost done, have seen this person less than ten times this year so far) so that when I start hanging out again it will feel more like a welcome reunion of familiarity and some new energy will be there.

So this is what I think: is it possible these people just don't get you and you need to ""find your people?""
Or the other solution which is to stop giving all fucks and just be yourself and hope you don't alienate people or get in too much trouble.

Holy hell!! You've never had sushi??? You wanna go to Japan to try all the food but you've NEVER HAD SUSHI?!? Wow. Just wow. I'm ashamed. This is almost as disappointing as your lack of appreciation for tomatoes and your basic-ass pasta shape preferences...

Yeah, you for sure need to go to the right sushi restaurant to get the right experience. You can start with some vegetable rolls, tamago (cooked egg) sushi, eel sushi (it's cooked), and shrimp sushi (also usually cooked). Then, you can gradually go on to try the raw sushi. I like salmon sashimi more than tuna. 

Here's the Chicken Shawarma recipe I use as a base:

* ~ 2 lb boneless skinless chicken
* 2 tsp cumin
* 2 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp allspice
* 3/4 tsp turmeric
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon
* 1 pinch cayenne
* Salt and black pepper
* Some olive oil

1. Cut up the raw chicken however you like (you don't have to cut it at all if you don't want. I like to do thin slices if I know my family will wanna put it in pita)
2. Put the chicken in a bowl and pour all the spices/seasonings on top. I usually like to add more of each spice, just eyeballing what looks right. I always add more garlic, onion, cumin, and paprika. You do what seems good for you. Salt and black pepper is to your taste. Remember, there's already some cayenne in there, so don't go too crazy on the black pepper! Don't wanna kill your roommate again! haha
3. Add a little bit of olive oil if you want, depending on how oily you like it. I barely add more than a tablespoon, if even that. I don't like overly oily things, and the chicken produces plenty of its own juices from its fat.
4. Mix everything all up
5. Throw it in a pan. I like to cook it covered for a little to let the chicken produce it's juices. Makes it super moist. I like for it to create a little ""sauce"" kinda haha.
6. After it's looking cooked, I'll turn the heat up a bit and cook it uncovered a bit to whatever texture I'm going for-- softer and juicier (quick), or more crispy (longer). It's up to you. 
 
And voila! 

This is just the method I use. You could use the recipe to create a shawarma marinade and grill it or cook it in the oven or whatever. I just like saucy things haha, hence my covered pan method. I've used this as a marinade on whole, bone-in skinless thighs and grilled it and it came out amazing as well. You don't always have to follow a recipe to a T.

You should take up meditation again, [but approach it from a more secular standpoint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM8fDHXXSIs). Once your brain is adapted to being in the present, I think perhaps conversations should feel much more natural to you. If you don't like Sam Harris' voice, use head space instead.  "
soc_916770,socialskills,reddit_comment,462,"Dude, seriously? I edited my reply so I made it clear. This is the last time I’m going to reiterate this because three people have had that same, shitty argument:

I’m not scared of every dude on the street.  I’m not scared of 99% of dudes. I actually don’t think every guy who approaches me in this manner means to come off as creepy/manipulative as it seems, which is why I made this post.

However, it would be extremely naive and EXTREMELY stupid to be a girl living in a city and think every person around me has the best intentions. It’s not just guys. Any stranger that approaches me in a weird way makes me uncomfortable. I’d rather me cautious and be careful around strangers than end up as a news headline of a missing/dead girl like you see with all the unfortunate woman that have to experience that. It’s really not that uncommon and it’s important to take precautions to be safe.

Please, think of a girl you love in your life. A sister, daughter, lover, anyone you care about. Now think of someone approaching them while they’re alone in a secluded area, or following them home alone in the dark. You wouldn’t want that, right? And you would want them to be cautious around strangers, especially ones larger than them, yeah? 

I’ve met a lot of amazing, helpful strangers but I’ve also been in very scary situations when I WAS naive and trusted everyone. 

AND AGAIN: I DONT THINK MEN WHO APPROACH ME IN DAYLIGHT WITH PEOPLE AROUND ARE CREEPY. I find it awkward, and I don’t really want to be apart of it, and that’s my own PERSONAL _PREFERENCE_ !!!!!! Some girls are okay with it, I PERSONALLY am not. And there’s nothing wrong with that. I just don’t like talking to strangers when I’m on a walk. If it’s in a social area, I’m fine with it, but I don’t like being approached on the street, never have. I’m sure you have your preferences for being social, nothing wrong with having mine.

I PERSONALLY, as in my PERSONAL PREFERENCE, also wouldn’t approach strangers to talk to them if I was at a park or walking or something, even if I thought they seemed interesting. Because I WOULDNT WANT TO. AND AGAIN, THIS IS MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE. Because it seems like you guys missed that big point. 

There is NOTHING WRONG w approaching women in the right environment as long as you aren’t being super creepy. But the woman also isn’t required to want to continue the conversation, and it’s also ok if she’s uncomfortable, even if u did anything right, because some people just ... don’t like talking to strangers, especially if they have somewhere to be."
soc_875788,socialskills,reddit_comment,142,"Fair enough, it's not mine either so I may have expressed myself too harsh. I don't question your intentions and it's not my place to judge them. I disagree about the looking for signs though, because the moment we start doing that we are analysing their behavior and indeed treating the other person as a research subject.  I also stand by my message that we can't help people unless they let us.  I understand the desire to fix whatever issue we think is troubling someone we care for, but this is impossible. We can't be each other's savior.  What we can do is respect other people's boundaries and try to understand them the best we can, and if we can't understand them, at least accept them for who they are - that is of course if these are people we care for."
soc_1397891,socialskills,reddit_comment,146,"As an introvert i totally understand where you’re coming from. Although i will say, sometimes it’s not a matter of what others want from us, but what we want from others. It seems like a common introvert experience that we long to be known by someone. We feel like we know everyone else so well because we listen all the time, but they don’t really know anything about us at all because we never share that information (especially being very private people). There’s no right or wrong here, but sharing more with others does serve to build more intimate relationships and friendships with other people. I would encourage you to be content to be quite and also encourage you to share so that others have the joy of knowing you as well. You are a gift to other people, so let yourself be known by them."
soc_601175,socialskills,reddit_comment,130,"No they're not. You're making excuses to avoid responsibility for your destiny. It's like looking at an experienced painter and saying the canvas or the brush is making the art.

Humans make connections with other people - not sports, alcohol or anything of that nature. People make connections where they can if they have the skills for it. Humans are social creatures so they like to create opportunities to make those connections. You can learn to make connections too, in the contexts you desire, if you own it and start learning. There's a reason it's called social **skills**.

On the positive side it means it's not because there's something wrong with you, it's because you lack experience. Experience can be gained, meaning changing your circumstances is completely up to you."

Since reading the book Radical Honesty, I feel that I'd like to try telling the truth and it would be refreshing to hear it from others for a change.   

I've disliked being asked how I am or what I do, for similar reasons as you, but maybe it could be an opportunity for true intimacy and connection, or some kind of healing even to happen by saying how we feel, what we are able and not able to do...where we are at, and not necessarily seeking an answer or solution from others.

Momentum and inertia, buddy. If some higher life form which claimed to know the twisty secrets of human minds came up to you, they might say “Well of course you’re unhappy, humans aren’t meant to come to a complete hard-stop like you did.“ Who cares about the why, who cares about fairness of said inescapable axiom- either the truth kicks you into gear or your stagnant waters will become a fertile spawning pool for unhealthy pests. If Earth ever came to a magical full-stop? Life as we know it would end. The Earth would fall into the sun or the solar system would proceed onward without us, depending on the duration of the effect. Momentum is precious.

soc_760073,socialskills,reddit_comment,200,"Yeah, fair enough. This is all context specific. I'm kind of taking OP at his word that things are especially egregious with his friend group, which is why I recommend a more extreme course of action. But yes, there are some social situations where you can finesse things a bit.

My take on OP's situation is that he has been the punching bag of the group for quite some time and he feels fed up. That's not a position where you have a lot of leverage to still negotiate your way back to an even footing. It just sounds to me like OP has been disrespected past the point of no return. And in that case, I think it's better to respond harshly (in the case of a physical altercation) or just ghost the group in the case of generalized disrespect.

When you're still 20 years old, there's a case to be made for salvaging these youthful friend groups. When you're 28, I don't think that's possible any longer. People are pretty set in their ways by then. So if your ""friends"" are still calling you a ""retard"" by that age, you should really just drop them. Just my opinion."
soc_1745585,socialskills,reddit_comment,162,"Imagine if you were the other guy, if you were her boyfriend (I’m going to call him Jeff to eliminate confusion) and Jeff is you.

How would you feel if she said to you, “we have to break up because I am friends with this new guy Jeff and he is really nice”? 

It doesn’t make much sense when you think about things from outside your own perspective. It stinks when your feelings aren’t reciprocated, but it is also really great when you learn to be platonic friends with women, or without expecting every female relationship to be sexual. 

Neither of you did anything wrong, but you also should not change your behavior just because you now know you cannot date her. You liked her before, I bet you still like the same qualities about her."
soc_1008366,socialskills,reddit_comment,1374,"&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I've gathered, your self-improvement has been more in the vein of ""how can I blend in with these people enough that they won't hurt me"". Have you considered that at this stage, that's the wrong thing to focus on?

I could not survive with such a narrow focus on self-improvement. I had to improve *everything*, all at once, in order to survive my abuse. I never knew in advance why I would be punished, so I literally had to be beyond approach in *everything*. The only way I could survive is to be so close to *perfection* in every aspect that other people couldn't tell the difference, even if it weren't truly attainable.

&gt; I think it would benefit you to really dig deep and work out why you hold such powerful false beliefs, and what you can do to start changing that thinking.

**They are NOT false beliefs**, and *nothing* will make me ""change my thinking."" If they were false, you would be *exploiting them*, not trying to change them. You want them changed *because they are correct*, not because they are false. You are a con-man trying to find a flaw in my armor - and not finding any, trying to con me into making one. I'm smarter that that.

&gt; I don't fully know your circumstances - maybe everybody in your immediate life is your enemy - but thinking that literally everybody on the planet is an enemy is stopping you from forming connections.

First, if it were the case that everybody in your immediate life is my enemy - then *why the fuck wouldn't everyone else be one too??? Why the fuck would there be a ""boundary"" between those who hate me and some mythical race of people who don't? How does that boundary defended? Why don't the people who hate me exterminate those who don't?

*Read a goddamned history book* - they're *filled* with stories of people exterminating people who think differently. Why do you deny this side of humanity? Why do you insist this is not an ever-present behavior?

Second, when I found out you people hated me **so much** that you all were willing to *inflict PTSD on a child,* that proved beyond a shadow of doubt that ""forming connections"" with the human species was **impossible**. I no longer *want* ""connections"" with the human species - I want *distance*. I want you assholes *out of my way* and I'll do whatever is legal to clear you out. 

But, of course, your whole life you've been *in* my way, and you'll fight to your last breath to *stay* in my way, just as you have been all my life. My true flaw was not realizing this sooner. My true flaw was in my childish belief that a ""connection"" could be ""formed"" with you, when you all were shouting in my face that you'd never accept such a ""connection"". *That* was my false belief, and that has since been corrected.

&gt; Until you're able to accept that some people are legitimately nice, there's not much I can do to convince you otherwise.

I'm not *supposed* to ""accept"" that some people are legitimately nice, because they've already shown that *they'll never be nice TO ME.* I have no doubts that they are nice to you or others. What you are confused about is this weird idea of ""universal niceness"" - that a person who is nice *is compulsively nice to everyone they meet* which is **absurd**. A person can be nice to one person and cruel to another - all people have the potential to be Janus-faced. Your refusal to accept this is why you're so confused. The same people who have spent your life being nice to you have spent the same lifetime being cruel to me - **THE SAME PEOPLE**. Only children think so simplistically that they believe that a person can only act one way toward everyone.

&gt; I don't endorse bullies of any variety. I don't blame you for developing irrational beliefs and a hair trigger response to human interaction. I don't believe you're a bad person.

And I don't believe you actually believe all of this. I believe that you will tell whatever lie is necessary to breach my defenses, because **to lie is human** - you *can't* tell me the truth, because, as a human being, you hate and fear facts because you can't ""break"" them; they stay true no matter how hard you attack them. So in order to cope, you all have to compulsively lie all the time - you refuse to deal in facts entirely because you fear them that much.

&gt; You speak a lot of people forming an impenetrable wall and stopping you from becoming their friends. I honestly think you are trying to befriend the wrong people. If they have already made up their minds, you need to try cracking into a different social circle. But I know your response to this advice is, ""There are no other circles. Literally everyone hates me instantaneously."" 

No it isn't, *asshole* - my reply is: I can't have been trying to ""befriend the wrong people"" because I eventually tried to choose circles *at random* precisely to hedge against this possibility. I specifically carried out an scientific experiment in order to prove what I was doing wrong only find out I couldn't prove that at all. My therapists confirmed I carried out the experiment correctly (while chastising the ethics of it) and that it strongly suggested what they later confirmed - I neither ""chose the wrong groups"" nor ""acted inappropriately towards people""; people were simply acting irrationally towards me
 
&gt; And if this is your attitude, I can't help. I'm sorry.

You never *could* help, it was never your *intention* to help, and I""m too smart to *ask* people - the same people who have spent my life *hurting me* - for help.

&gt; You know, by continuing to indulge in these self-isolating thought patterns

**THEY'RE NOT SELF-ISOLATING!!!** *You* assholes chose to isolate me! **YOU DID!!!** 

**STOP LYING TO ME ABOUT WHAT YOU DID!!! STOP *GASLIGHTING* ME INTO BELIEVING THAT YOUR WILLFUL, UNINSTIGATED ABUSE IS *MY* FAULT!!!**
---

I did *nothing* - **NOTHING** - to cause other people's rejection!!! **GET THAT THROUGH YOUR THICK SKULL!!** You all chose of *your own free will* - *before you got to know me* - to reject me. Your rejection of me is *your* fault. Quit justifying your prejudicial rejection of me by lying and saying something *I* did caused it. That is false; every therapist agrees AND states that this is classic gaslighting.

How I behave now has *NO RELATION* to how I behaved as a child - *even my last therapist was shocked at my change between pre-diagnosis and post-diagnosis.* *He* said I was like ""two different people"" and worried what that meant. **Stop blaming child-Cryosleep for Captain Cryosleep's behavior** unless you seriously believe that people were punishing me for what I *might* do - or what they *tried to manipulate me to do* in the future.

I did not *once* act maliciously during my childhood - which means **people were *obligated* not to act maliciously toward me!** I did everything correct to not receive malice - ***and they delivered it anyway.*** If they're *already* being malicious to me after I've behaved *correctly*, changing that behavior isn't going to be any more correct, and won't stop their malice. They chose to be malicious *before* I acted, not *because* how I acted.

And *no one* ever deviated from that behavior.

---

In *every* written word on gaslighting, blaming the victim for causing the abusers' abuse is the *first* warning sign for gaslighting - and you have been ringing that bell like a fire-alarm.

Your *very* next reply **must start with your explicit acceptance and internalization that people's rejection of me was made of their own free will and completely regardless of my behavior**, or you will be considered too toxic to communicate with and you will be reported to reddit as an abuser.

I don't need to accept your toxicity. That is the boundary I'm setting, and you *will* respect it come Hell or high water."

soc_103724,socialskills,reddit_comment,383,"I can completely relate to where you're coming from. Throughout high school I've often felt bitter for not being naturally/comfortably sociable. I've felt depressed as a result more than once. 

That said, it seems that a lot of your anxiety stems from the fact that you care a lot about what others think of you and you want them to recognize you, but it's falling short. The first step in this case would be to live for yourself. Don't live to please anyone else. Great people never became great because they tried to fish for compliments from others. Pick up hobbies or routines because they're fun or interesting, not because they'll get you attention. Start thinking about doing things that will help you become the best person you can be instead of doing things that will help you become super popular. You can only depend on yourself to be happy; you can't expect others to fill that role for you. (This is not a blanket rejection of all social interaction- a good social life comes as a side effect of being happy with who you are as a person. Once you're comfortable with yourself, you can be more comfortable around others). 

But seriously, who gives a fuck if you don't date people. The real morons are the people who are counting dates like video game statistics. I'm single and could not care less about the fact that guy x is seeing girl y. Honestly, you have some pretty tough balls to ask that girl out despite the pressure. Fuck them for trying to shape who you are. It's up to you and only you to do shape yourself. 

Now on porn: check out /r/nofap or /r/pornfree to start off. Then, start immersing yourself into other activities. Exercise does a lot of good for deterring meat-beating. Literally distract yourself away from porn. Being away from your bedroom, where you can get too comfortable, helps. 

Lastly, keep smiling. There is no reason to ever give up a positive attitude. Smile for yourself if not anyone else. Understand that there is so much more in this world to be happy or pleased about than the conceit of a few. They will be but a tiny minority in your life of everyone you have and will met."
soc_63482,socialskills,reddit_comment,407,"I don't know if it's helpful such as all of the other posters are doing to assume that a person who is dominant in conversation is necessarily an asshole. If you think you're dealing with an asshole, you'll treat him like an asshole whether you try to or not. And you might be dealing with an asshole, they're somewhat common. Yet, you can't quite live your life solving problems by assuming people are assholes, so I even treat assholes like better parts.

I can say, I am someone who is often dominant in conversation. Now, this isn't because I like to hog the conversation but I'm really knowledgeable about a huge range of subjects, so I often just happen to have the most interesting thing to say about a subject, and this is coming from a person who is not hugely confident and not necessarily inclined to think I have anything interesting to say, but when it's apparent that I do, it is apparent, and that's often.

However, have no doubt that I'm conscious of this fact and regretting it and hoping that someone else will be able to contribute in some way so that I'm not just talking at a group of people who are staring at me. I want to know what you have to say and I want to hear your contributions and see what they reveal about you, your perspective, your existence, history, whiles, ways and whims and I'm hoping that any opportunity in conversation will make everyone I ever talk to ever into a better friend than they were before the conversation. So, say whatever you think you should, and interrupt me if you have to. I don't mind, it happens naturally and accidentally all of the time and if I have anything really important to say (never), I'll just find another chance to work it in.

I would assume that people's intentions are generally good, but that it is difficult to navigate social situations and no one on earth is particularly good at doing it. We all make the mistakes we do for different reasons and the important thing is to analyze the situation on an individual level and consider what effect you want to have on the situation and how best to enact that effect. In general you want to have a good effect on a situation, but we don't always stop to think how that outcome should be accomplished."
soc_1290559,socialskills,reddit_comment,155,"I’m not saying the term “pussy” strictly means cat. I’m simply saying these slang terms are always open to interpretation because of how they have integrated in our language overtime. When people use the term “pussy” to insult someone cowardly they are almost never referring to a cat nor a female vagina, these slang terms have been used so much they’re standalone. Which means calling someone a pussy doesn’t mean “you’re cowardly like a cat” or “you’re cowardly like a female”. It just means “you’re a pussy” because it has become a standalone word with its own meaning. There is no need to link it back to anything, but if you choose to do so then it’s your choice to interpret it as whatever you think. Therefore in cases like these, I think it’s unfair to push your interpretation of an insult onto someone who meant it in a different and more commonly used context."

soc_81540,socialskills,reddit_comment,299,"Your friend should have at least said goodbye to you, and probably should have asked the other friend if they could give you a lift too, though your friend might have had reasons not to do that.

I believe people have a right to feel whatever emotions they feel. If you were very upset, those are your feelings and I wouldn't call it an overreaction.  That said, we're responsible for our behaviour. If you told your friend you were very upset, fine. That's being assertive about your feelings and is good. If you used a loud tone of voice or spoke at length about it, (I'm not saying you did), your friend also has a right not to want to listen to that.

You may have interpreted the scenario as meaning that your friend was betraying you, or abandoning you, or has terrible manners, or doesn't care, etc. It may have had an impact on the extent to which you want to continue to consider that person to be a friend or not. It's up to you whether to consider it a big thing or to let it pass, try to forget about it and appreciate the good qualities your friend has.

Maybe your friend is from a different culture or personality type or isn't good at social skills or something. You can decide to accept it, or you can keep an eye out for things like this and decide to spend less time with that friend.

I would suggest not mentioning that incident to that friend again.  I think telling the friend once that you were upset is enough. Either they get the message or they don't. They might actually reform their behaviour based on what you said even while not wanting to admit they did anything wrong."

I know your situation because I've lived it. It's tough and giving advice here I don't think it really helps too much for people like us. It's like telling a paraplegic he can walk if he really wants to by following some simple steps. It just doesn't work. In my case I have a medical reason for some of my shortcomings due to being on the autistic spectrum. Doesn't keep me from trying though. 

I'm in my early 30s now so I've learned a few things that have helped me maybe you can get something from it. 

Exercise. Daily. Even if you don't feel like it, do something. It's one of the biggest all around life improvements I've found. You'll feel better and as a bonus you'll look better.

Diet. Increase healthy fat intake and decrease carbohydrate intake. I know very smart people who eat taco bell everyday but I can't do it. I feel better and think more clearly when I eat clean. 

Meditation. Everyday for at least 15 minutes. Research some techniques and try to follow them. I started with headspace app and it's great. Meditation over time will help you with separating yourself from the whims of your thoughts and emotions. It's not going to stop them but it will allow you to take a step back and not be carried away by them. 

""Be yourself because everybody else is taken"". Don't try to be something you're not. I spent years trying to mold myself into the person who I thought I wanted to be. It's a fools errand. Have faith in yourself.

soc_127671,socialskills,reddit_comment,316,"You used the word ""better"" several times. For the most part, when applying this term to humans, it becomes subjective, especially when dealing with creative tasks. Comparing yourself to others obsessively often leads to depression and low self-esteem. You're comparing the best qualities of a GROUP of people to your own, which is simply setting an unrealistic and unreasonable standard for yourself, and when you don't meet those impossible standards, of course you're going to repeatedly feel like a failure. 

Sure, I wish I could throw a football like Peyton Manning, play the piano like Beethoven, deliver a speech like president Obama, be able to fix things like my brother-in-law, be as handsome as my cousin, have great business knowledge like my dad. They're all better than me at those things. But, you know what? They can't do what I can. They don't posses the collection of skills and personality traits that led to my personal success, however I might define that. 

You feel shallow? Find a way to deepen yourself. Be introspective. Be brutally honest with yourself, especially when it hurts. Most of us lie to ourselves every day so our ego isn't bruised. Only you know your deepest thoughts and desires. Feelings of emptiness? Look inside yourself to find what fulfills you. Again, use brutal honesty. You might think it's noble to help out the needy and lie to yourself saying, ""this is what will fulfill me"". You might do this because society puts that type of person on a pedestal, and you want to be viewed by others as a good person. But maybe that won't be fulfilling to you, and there's nothing wrong with that. 

Only you can find solutions to fix these feelings. Sure, therapy might help, but it boils down to you. Write it out if that helps you process things. It helps me. The key is realistic, brutal honesty.

I think you being physically present around them helps a lot because they get to see you all the time and along with an occasional chime in so they’re aware you’re engaged. (Better than wishing someone would notice and come up to you or them always not including you because they don’t see you all the time). It’s a bit of trial and error but don’t give up if you’re still ignored or feel like you’re glitching out. Sometimes it’s just that you and the group don’t mesh and that’s okay. You gave it a good try.
soc_217686,socialskills,reddit_comment,783,"If we're being honest here, being THE guy is supposed to come natural. In order to be THE guy, you have to have it in you, naturally. It can't be learned, it can't be fabricated, it just has to be there with you already. What does it take to be THE guy though? What are the essential keys to becoming/being the THE guy? (If you think you got it in you a little already) 

***Top 10 things for becoming THE guy IMO:*** 

**1) Be unique:** For you to be THE guy, there only has to be one of you, because well..., then you're not THE guy. 

**2) Be kind, content, and confident:** You have to be approachable, fun to be approached by, sympathetic, empathetic, strong, courageous, a little witty, but most importantly HAPPY. Happiness is like a drug that is contageous. If you want to be THE guy, you have to have THE drug. Remember, you're the supply/dealer of the drug known as happiness and love. 

**3) Be a fucking boss:** Just own it. Own everything. Own your shitty smile. Own your ugly ass laugh. Own your third nipple. Own every imperfection and use every perfection to you're advantage. People want to relate, and it's easy to do so when you're comfortable as shit with ***all*** aspects of who you are. When people see that you're carefree and truly love/appreciate yourself, they'll want to be like you/associate with you. 

**5) FIND PURPOSE:** A simple as it is. Are you a couch potato, video game playing, booger eating guy? If so, then whatever. Just as long as you also are a guy that works hard, cares for himself/others around him, has future goals, and is always trying to improve himself. (PRO TIP: Don't eat your boogers)

**6) Stand out:** In every sense of the phrase. Stand out with the way you speak, the way you walk, and even the way you stand! Once again, you must be unique and different! Keep in mind, you shouldn't be over the top. Remember, you're not seeking attention. You're THE guy and you know you're THE guy so people's attention, opinions, and thoughts about you is/are meaningless. 

**7) It's the little things:** Helping that guy when no one's watching. Picking up that piece of trash someone littered and throwing it away when no one's around to see it. To be THE guy, you have to be the fucking guy. You can't just put on a show or facade in front of everyone, and then behind clothes doors be unconfident, unkind, and dirty. It's not just about doing kind deeds however. It's about telling that ugly ass bucktooth stanky breathed pig of a girl how beautiful her necklace is. While she might be very unattractive, her necklace ain't and she'll fucking love you forever. Being THE guy means getting people to like you, one person at a time. Touch the souls of others, like Jesus man. 

**8) LOVE:** Similar to number 7, the way to people is by loving them. Even if they're assholes back, someone's watching you. GOD, that cute girl, the guy who kind of looks up to you/thinks you're cool. Someone may have their eyes on you, and THE guy is always calm, cool, and collected (no matter the situtation). Love, love, and love a little more. 

**9) FIGHT:** You might ask, ""What about number 8 loger_labbit?"", ""I thought we were supposed to love everyone, hug trees, and suck off random strangers?"" ***You're wrong.*** Spread the love, but when it comes down to it, people can take advantage of you and others, and in order to be THE guy, you'll definitely have to fight for what's right. See someone getting picked on? Step up to the bully. See any sort of injustice? Step up and say whats on you're mind. Someone getting in your grill? Show them how mean you can fucking be. 

**Favorite quote from my dad:** ""You may be stronger than me, taller than me, bigger than me, and quicker than me, but you'll *never* be as mean as me.""

Yes, THE guy is great to be around. He's kind, cool, and loving, but when it comes down to it, he's the meanest fucker on this planet. 

**10) Speak less than you know, have more than you show:** *Title just about says it all.*


This is just about what it takes to really be THE man. Unless you're an all star football player or the hottest dude on campus, you shouldn't expect *everyone* to know who you are. Just be you, and if THE man is inside of you, he will be unleashed. But hey, if you don't got it, *you don't got it*.

But a really simple and effective conversation starter is:

Obviously this is ridiculously formulaic, but it's better broken down this way. E.g,

Hey, sorry, \[introductory\] but your shirt looks really nice \[compliment\] and I have to know where you got it \[question\]. I'm \[x\] by the way \[introduction\].

soc_514869,socialskills,reddit_comment,144,"I used to think of ""cringe"" as this useless emotion that prevents me from becoming social. But learn to channel this cringe into something useful by realizing that it's only trying to hold you back from doing *specific* social blunders, *not the general* habit of socializing itself, if you get what I mean. And it's up to you to decipher what that social blunder was. Of course do all the analyzing in private, or with a helpful friend. It helps to write your experiences in a journal. Never analyze yourself while socializing. Learn to trust your gut.

And it always feels like ""forcing it"" when you try something new. E.g. learning how to juggle, play football, write Chinese characters properly, etc. Over time, the stuff you repeatedly do becomes natural, and you will think of it as less a ""mask"" than your actual personality."

Step 1. Go find a chicken. Keep it alive for 3 days. Feed her only at midnight when you perform a ritual of your choice.
Step 2. Keep your  chicken blindfolded all night.
Step 3. Ask your mom to stay in the room with you, with a mirror facing the moon.
In 3-5 days you will make millions of online friends, songs will be written about you and virgins will put petals in front of you.

Long story short, you have to message people that you find interesting. 'Hey, I saw your post about x, That. s interesting, but I think that... bla bla bla..'

Blocking you is a big indication that she isn't interested in you.  There's a saying, ""men are afraid women will reject them, women are afraid men will kill them"", and there are too many stories out there about men killing women for not accepting them.  When you kept going after the woman, you scared her and she was trying to get away from the threat.  It could also be seen as stalking, even if it were for a short time.

soc_659134,socialskills,reddit_comment,202,"I was having a similar epiphany earlier this morning.   

I notice I hold myself back in situations with people I am unfamiliar with. I don’t express creative energy or original though, as OP alluded to. I’m not natural. If I begin speaking at the same time as someone else, I stop, and let them go. 

This is more specific to ME. But I find I act like I owe people something upon first meeting. I give way too much influence to the first impression, or second, or third, and I’m just far too polite and submissive. I won’t even venture to start listing different ways people could respond negatively to this. 

Instead, look to those extroverts. They seem to come off so naturally because they aren’t treating any interaction with too much significance. And they recognize an interaction is an INTERaction, which requires participation, and importantly: deserves to be  enjoyed by all parties

Edit: to clarify: everyone is entitled to enjoy each interaction. I am going to focus more effort on getting the most out of each experience, rather than trying to put as much as possible into it. I think if I open up more it will bring people around more."
soc_153676,socialskills,reddit_comment,608,"I've been to three community colleges since I moved and transferred a bit for there and can give information on each.  My experience was bad, good, and best . . .

The first one actually did have dorms, and I'll tell you right now . . . I hated it.  While I did make some pretty good friends for a while the program wasn't what I wanted, my roommate was a complete ass that had a mental break-down trying to strangle me on a trip, and since my family moved out of state I decided to join them to take a break and seriously examine what I wanted to do.

I'll say this for any college, if you have the option of saving money by not living in a dorm I recommend it.  While you may think this will hinder you socially, you'll save stacks of money which are better spent socializing later in life.  The dorms caused the larger portion of my student debt which means your actual life starts much later.  Money you would have for dates and to do cool stuff later will be instead stuck paying back the piper.

I digress though

The second I went to was to get general credits out of the way since the first didn't have a lot that transferred.  I took the most general of general that would transfer to just about anywhere.  I met some people that I could chat with but never really hung-out with after classes.  This isn't surprising since you'll rarely see people in multiple classes with you in such a case.  If I had more motivation and drive I could have joined numerous clubs and met people that way, in this situation it's up to you to be motivated enough to reach out as you won't meet anyone with a degree of consistency.  There's also online meetup groups if you have any near you, don't assume you have to meet people just from your campus - it's much too narrow a scope.

The third however was when I nailed down exactly what I wanted to do.  I wanted a degree in information security and analysis and CNSS 4011 certs.  Since the classes were aimed towards a specific degree and the campus was smaller, but well recognized in the field I met tons of people that shared similar interests and multiple classes.  Since I got my gen-ed out of the way I saw the same group of people regularly from semester to semester.  I joined the InfoSec club (required for those on the grant) and because of it was required to participate in activities.  I started spending more time with people in the same field outside of the club since between class and club you start getting to know people quite well.  Eventually I made a handful of relatively close friends and acquaintances, and I continued hanging out with them often while I finished my BT via an online degree offered by a state university.  While I've fallen out of touch with said friends since (common in life IME) I wouldn't trade it.

These of course are my circumstances which can wildly vary from others.  The girlfriends I had through this time I never met on campus but instead online and through friends of friends.  Equally I never liked the booze it up mentality and generally dislike alcohol since it fucks up my blood sugar.  If you're looking to party hardy you will likely have been disappointed in my shoes - we were more interested in war driving, dumpster diving, fucking with servers, testing exploits, LAN parties, etc . . . so yeah &gt;_&gt;"
soc_540202,socialskills,reddit_comment,254,"Small talk doesn't really have to be gossip, you can talk about the place you're in, food, sport, anything as long as it's uncontroversial and unimportant.

I personally avoid small talk at all costs, usually its a good opener to talk about unimportant things like the weather (meh), but then I usually try to talk about their feelings and point of view about something particular, for instance, you can chat about how busy the cafe is throughout the week, but then you can ask them about their own experience and how they feel about the cafe, and why they feel that way, which will kind of get you to ask more questions about their feelings and personality if you're a good listener.

But then it depends on your intentions when it comes to people, if you just wanna kill time then small talk makes no harm really, but if you're genuinely interested in people and their stories and feelings, small talk is not going to take you anywhere.

Here are a few books I recommend

\- How to Talk to Anyone, I'd recommend this one for general tips for any social interaction.

\- Improv(e) Your Conversations, This one is very good when it comes to thinking on your feet, and not running out of things to say, it's a quick read and I always find myself using some of the techniques from this book.

soc_199037,socialskills,reddit_comment,289,"I think it's got a lot to do with analytical people not understanding the emotional context of the average person, and the average person not understanding the lack of added context to the less emotional analytical person. A lot of engineers and tech people are highly analytical, they think very rigidly in logic, and the logical part of their brain will overpower the emotional part of their brain. To them, telling you dryly that you messed up while using a program is just them explaining to you why the mistake happened, they don't think of the emotion behind the conversation, where-as ""normal"" people will use the emotion as context clues for a ""bigger picture"" that doesn't actually exist from the perspective of the tech worker. 

I think the world really has a hard time understanding this, and more recently I've come to decide that it's a lot like the transgender debate. I may not understand transgender people, but I believe that they are different than me. I am an analytical person, and I don't understand emotional people, but I believe that they are different than me. What I don't think is that emotional people understand that analytical people are different than then, and not everything is hidden in subtext. I am dry, I just am, and I will usually not interpret much emotional context from your dialogues with me. I really just don't feel that I'm wired that way. I socialize with those I get along with, but they tend to be more analytical like me, and I don't really feel accepted by emotional people.

IMO, neither side is really wrong, although I definitely have a bias in favor of the tech worker, since I am a tech worker."
soc_1451148,socialskills,reddit_comment,245,"“I hope to take a break” I think, is a good start. Not as far as testing her but for your own self. Whether she is being too kind to upkeep her conversation with you, or simply too busy, or find it hard to respond due to language limitations, whatever else the “possible” explanation could be, it’s always important to refrain from being emotionally codependent with or on another. Coming from a neutral standpoint, you can still have meaningful conversations with her and very much have an ‘active’ relationship while not expecting too much from it. It is pretty apparent that, at this current time, she is unable to meet your needs. That is okay. There is so much that we can do when it involves another but we do have control on how we choose to handle the situation. I suggest being open to others who can click with you and meet your needs. It won’t minimize the respect you have for your friend and it will increase the respect you have for yourself.

In regards to the frequent apologies, it’s kind of hard to say. It can be due to insecurities, or fear to disappoint, or it can be because she doesn’t like late responses herself, or, on top of fear to disappoint, she just simply has an active life and she does feel bad to have anyone waiting on her because she believes on being that great friend.

Normally, just being optimistic is the most rational and constructive thing to do, but when people are feeling defeated our brain chemistry does weird shit and sometimes being overly optimistic can be seen as dismissing 

Also, depending on your relationship with the person, a hug or just putting your hand on their shoulder can be good."

Most of the time you don’t say what you actually think, in my case is was because fear of rejection mainly.

So you’re sending different intentions all the time and your body has a hard time knowing what you want.

Basically, if you aren’t saying what you actually think, then you won’t ever be able to unless you see a therapist or something.

So express yourself, and don’t feel guilty, you change so many times a day. Well maybe your emotions do, and they change how you interact with life.

soc_1512837,socialskills,reddit_comment,989,"Hey, I can only offer you a little on this, and some of it will just be what has worked for me. The only part I believe is *not* anecdotal is this: it is okay for you to be whatever and whoever you are. Be whatever you are. Be whoever you are. If you want to work on yourself, you will. Self-love comes first. When you have self-love, all you need is time, and you *will* grow towards who you want to be.

But who you ""want to be"" can come later. Be who you *are now*, even if that's someone who doesn't have the amount of self-love she deserves. I realize this may be a tough sell, so instead of asking you to ""just do the thing I just said"", I really only want to ask you to take that suggestion, keep it in your back pocket, and take it out every once in a while to consider it.

====

Preamble over, here's some bulleted advice.

1: consider the idea of accepting yourself as-is (see above)

2: get a therapist (do this even if #1 works)

3: get diagnosed, if applicable (do this even if #2 works. some diagnoses 'hide' well)

4: try to start a specific, new habit: asking yourself what *you* want. Try to notice when what ""you"" want is actually what ""you were taught"" to want, or what someone else wants *for* you (or from you).

====

Long-form advice, encouragement, anecdotes, that sort of thing: 

If you don't have access to therapy, that's not your fault. It's not the end of this, either. Just, please, give yourself credit for this 'quest' being harder for you because of your lack of access. Cheer yourself on for *any* progress you make. [Even asking the question from your OP is progress. This image explains briefly.](https://i.imgur.com/raJxZLa.png)

If the idea of seeking a diagnosis scares you right now, don't do it. You have plenty of other stuff on your plate; you don't have to add this right now if you're not up to it. See the above image: per the cycle of change model, it's okay to be in the 'pre-contemplation' stage. It's part of the cycle of change. This, for reference, is a well-accepted model. It's taught to Social Workers, among others.

The last thing I'll add about therapy and diagnosis: I do not have an opinion on a possible diagnosis for you. It would be wildly irresponsible if I did; there is nowhere near enough information here for that. I am only suggesting diagnosis because: 

1: You have said your current pattern of behavior is not to your liking

2: There are any number of reasons you could've avoided a diagnosis until now. Some diagnoses hide well, through high-functioning, through trauma (another diagnosis), or many other means.

Diagnosis talk over. Next topic: it's okay to fuck all of this up.

It's okay to just launch into a relationship, even being emotionally unavailable. It's okay to go on dates that ""don't go anywhere"". Going on dates because you want to go on dates is a worthy goal, and a worthy outcome.

Being in a relationship where you are emotionally available is *vulnerable*. You can get hurt in any relationship, and you can get hurt much more if you're emotionally available. Learning how to let down that armor and become available is hard, but it's also dangerous. The only person who can decide if the danger is worth it to you, is you. All I can really offer is that the maximum possible emotional depth of your relationships will be constrained by the amount of emotional vulnerability you are able to have in said relationship. And that it's **okay** for your relationships to be constrained by your lack of availability/vulnerability.

Talk. The conversation you've tried to start here? See if you can find someone in the face-to-face world that you can have this conversation with. If you want to practice having this conversation, reddit is as good a place as any. If I seem like someone you can talk to, fire away. If I don't seem like it, trust your gut!

Seek emotional support, so you have people who you can go to for venting, validation, protection, healing, advocacy, or whatever else you might have need for along the way to achieving the dating relationships you want and/or the emotional availability you want for yourself. Doing all this on your own is just. Absolutely. Brutal. It leaves you so, so susceptible to shitty people.

If you find that emotional support, and someone you're dating is trying to separate you from it/from them: that is just about the #1 red flag for abuse. Run, please.

More advice: try to let go of the idea that your first relationship will go perfectly, or even smoothly. Give it a shot, protect yourself, and be as kind to yourself and the other person as you can manage *while* protecting yourself. As they seem worthy of the requisite trust, start having conversations with them about stuff like your OP. If they never seem worthy of that trust, it's your call how long you keep the relationship, and where you're willing to ""go"" with the relationship. Capslock (actually shiftkey) incoming:

NOBODY. EVER. GETS. TO TELL YOU. WHAT YOU ""OWE"" THEM. IN A RELATIONSHIP.

There is not a schedule for trusting someone. There is not a schedule for loving someone. There is not a schedule for kissing them, fooling around with them, fucking them, moving in with them, for any of it. There. Is. No. Schedule. 

It's okay to be emotionally unavailable in your first relationship. Or your second. Or your fifth.

It's okay, to go on lots of dates, with any number of people, and have sex with none of them. Or kiss none of them. Or even *like* none of them.

It's okay to have stopped reading all this a long, long time ago.

Also looking respectable will make others see you in a better light, thus brightening your day.

Someone deleted a comment, so this was my response to having a constant flow of confidence: Yep, it's almost like putting a bumper sticker on a car, and suddenly it goes faster. If you want a continuous flow of confidence, best way to do it is by working out and keeping track of the progress. Since it takes a while to get in good shape, every day you will see small progress, and that should keep you motivated. Then you'll see how others will see you more attractive, even have opposite sex walk up to you and start a conversation, instead of the usual ""hey, can I buy you a drink?""

soc_1714076,socialskills,reddit_comment,117,"Situation-ships of all sorts are often like this, though.

Often they are not explicitly dishonest - just unbalanced.

Oftentimes the person who is less-invested still has some level of affection/like for their more-invested FWB/counterpart. They are just ""confused"" - or they are cool with it and just lack the empathy to see how its impacting their counterpart. But ultimately (for whatever reason) they aren't able to show the real empathy/care that the more-invested party deserves.

An emotionally-mature person can realize that not every dynamic is healthy for both parties - and that its possible acknowledge that truth without needing there to be a ""bad guy"" in the situation, or needing to label one side's wants/feelings as wrong/invalid."
soc_664619,socialskills,reddit_comment,155,"Some people are picky about the timing of responding to messages, ie, they might send one initial message, and then when they get a response they'll have a set period of time to wait before replying. It's weird and imo unnecessary, but a lot of people do it. This isn't necessarily a sign that he isn't interested, but I wouldn't wait for it either. However, what I think is really important regardless is not to get too attached to someone. It's your first date, I wouldn't have thought there *was* anything to get over. If he's interested he'll reply eventually, if not no big deal, find someone else. 

P.S It seems to me you're a bit insecure about your dating life and/or using Tinder? Not my place to say so or anything, but Tinder is really common now and it isn't rare for people to get dates exclusively from Tinder. Nothing to be ashamed of."
soc_371872,socialskills,reddit_comment,469,"I know what you mean mate. Honestly, a lot of people do – maybe more than you'd think. I struggled with this sort of thing for most of my life and while I haven't fully conquered it (it's a lifelong process) I have made big strides.

There isn't necessarily an easy fix but I know something that might help. First let me propose a hypothetical scenario and have a think about whether or not this sounds like you: say you walk into a party, there's 30 or so people there. When you walk in and make the rounds, 29 of those people greet you with a big warm smile, and 1 of them gives you kind of awkward, unfriendly look. In this scenario, do you think when you went home afterwards and recounted the night, you would give disproportionate weight to the 1 unfriendly look you received (as opposed to viewing it in the context of the overwhelmingly positive reception you received)? If so, you most likely have what's called a negative attentional bias. It's the tendency to disregard positive stimuli and instead focus on negative information, even it forms the minority. I've struggled with the same sort of thoughts you spoke about for years, and when I spoke to a psychologist he spoke about this concept with me. Negative attentional bias is the fuel that feeds feelings of inadequacy. There are other factors but when trying to fight something as complex as an ingrained frame of mind, it's best to break it down and focus on the parts, and this is a big one.

Attentional biases can be modified through a technique called Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM). There's an app you can download for free called Happy Faces. It's a game that will show you four stock photos of people, one of which looks friendly and happy and three which look pissed off or unwelcoming. The goal is to tap the happy face as quickly as possible. By playing this for a couple of minutes each day you can retrain your brain through CBM to focus on and retain positive stimuli. You might feel a bit silly at first but there are plenty of studies on this technique which have proven its efficacy. Anecdotally I can tell you it has helped me to change my outlook quite a bit. There's plenty of other things you can try as well, such as meditation, gratitude, etc. Different things work for different people but if I could give you one tip it would be to give CBM a go. These are matters of psychology so it helps to take a practical, measurable approach.

If you decide to give it a go or want to talk more about any of this, feel free to DM me. If not all the best :)"

It’s not because I believe in astrology but because I love my birthday so much and I ask other people their sign partially because it’s an easy ice breaker and partially because their response tells me a lot about them. I definitely judge people more if they get all huffy and puffy about the question, makes me think they’re uptight and possibly more right leaning than I am. I usually forget peoples sign after a day unless it’s a friend and they actually care about their sign, then I make an effort to remember. Or if I have a friend who distinctly doesn’t like astrology, sometimes I’ll be like “that’s cause your a Leo” just to poke fun at them.

Going deeper, though - I am in a very similar situation as you.

My older friends choose to pick me up when they do - and you have to stop thinking of yourself as a burden, too, because people who have the sort of freedom that you and I do not have all remember what it's like to be so stranded. The general attitude of such people is ""The more the merrier!""
These people with whom you connect with - do they understand your situation? Do they invite you to go places? If so, kindly ask for a ride. They will oblige if they are fun people.
If they don't invite you places and it's up to you to initiate plans, do something near your house that you can walk to. Meet up with them at a park nearby to chill - bring drinks, whatever. You don't have to do something exotic to hang out."

When another company reached out and expressed interest, they didn't think they could meet the challenge, but I coached them through it as they nearly had a nervous breakdown.

Now, they're off to this great new job, large salary increase, all that good stuff, because they took my advice. Not so much as a ""hey thanks for your help,"" they just seem to pretend like it was ALL on them. 

I like this person but they're so draining, I thought it would be a nice break when they left the job. But I think I've turned into a bottomless source of narcissistic supply for them, because they love to hang out now, and STILL bitch about the job *they're about to leave* (how they were never appreciated, never given enough etc. etc.) Very little is returned in the form of help or appreciation, it's like they need to feel superior at all times somehow.

I don't need them to be emotional back, but some acknowledgement or positive support would be nice for a change. Now I have to figure out how to remain distant once they start the new job, because it's more stress than it's worth.

soc_435645,socialskills,reddit_comment,617,"Mistakes. Everyone makes them. And we mean EVERYONE. The only difference is that most people learn from them. You admit that you do not learn from the mistakes you make. Are these little mistakes, or big bloopers? Are your mistakes hurting the person that you supposedly love? From your post, it appears your mistakes are causing some damage. And that is dangerous. When you decide to do something that will be a mistake, do you stop to think of the possible consequences to yourself? Do you stop and think how your actions (behaviors) have the potential to affect others? This is where you go off the rail because of your poor choices. 
Now, we want you to think about the last mistake that you made. Think of what it was and then think about how it made you appear to others around you. Now, think about how the mistake you made affected the people that are the closest to you. Write these things down so that you can look at it all when you are finished. Now don't beat yourself up over it, but THINK about it as we laid it out. Take some time and do it now. 
Looking back over the example, how did your decision to go ahead with the mistake make you appear to others? Also, how many people did your poor choice affect in some way? And, how did it affect the people that are closest to you? How does that make you feel knowing this? Now, again looking back, try to think of the moment that you decided to do that one thing that was a mistake. What if you had taken a minute, a moment, a millisecond to CONSIDER  your choice and how that choice would have affected people close to you and also how you would appear to others as you stepped through that poor choice? 
What is important here is that we must take the time to consider HOW our mistakes affect our friends, our family, and ourselves. Sometimes people do not take the time to consider situations properly. This is where the problems come into play. We must place ourselves in a position to be able to consider the consequences of our behaviors and choices and be able to step away quickly in order to protect ourselves from harm. Believe it or not, the brain is actually set up to avoid danger and make us run from it in order to protect ourselves. And protect the people we love and care about from emotional stress and embarassment. It's not as hard as you may think. The secret is to be able to recognize danger early and act quickly to get away from that danger. Perhaps you are not taking the time to recognize potential danger. That is something you must begin to do everyday. Be on watch for danger. 
How can you do that? Easy. Dump the toxic people from your life - which you have already chosen #1 over #2 - and THINK  about each choice that you make and act accordingly, which means CONSIDER how your choices will affect your friends, your family and yourself. 
We know this is a lot to take in, but life is hard. And life tortures us enough, so why must we do it to each other and ourselves? 
And hang in there, because you are going to do well. You already know there is a problem and that is the first and most difficult step to take. You are already a winner. Hey, deep down inside you is greatness just waiting to get out. Give yourself permission to do just that. We have faith in you.

soc_691991,socialskills,reddit_comment,276,"I'll just give you advice that I feel might help given what I've read.

1. Think of yourself as a product, you might have the sweetest intentions and be honest, but it's not really what you say, it's HOW you're saying it that's playing against ya I feel like. And yes this even applies to written communication. Try to have a ""fun trumps all"" attitude and look for that above everything else.

2. You're too invested and outcome dependant. People can feel that (That you want their approval too much) or it can make you tense or give off vibes you don't wanna give. Forget about the outcome. Let your goal be having the most amount of fun in your interactions just for the sake of having fun, not because you want x or y outcome to happen.

3. And this one's all on you: Become a fun person/Develop a fun/carefree attitude. This one's all on you dawg. If you think of yourself as too quiet or boring it's up to you to gain that excitement and make your life interesting. Heck, I know people who's lives are nothing to write home about but it's their attitudes and ways of framing their reality that makes them almost magical. Try to have a positive outlook. No one likes a negative Nancy or a quiet Quentin lmao. Ok might be a stretch some quiet ppl are cool but try to ALWAYS leave ppl off better after they interact with you. Be a willing participant and make your personality shine. If it doesn't shine yet you better start polishing it! That's on you.

Hope this helps. Best of luck!!"
soc_66428,socialskills,reddit_comment,181,"I'm in a fraternity at one of the biggest Greek schools in the country and we have what I'd guess you call dirty rush. We call it informal. At our chapter we hold rush events for rushees. We supply beer and a party in order to get to know them better and see if they're a good fit. Here are what I think are some of the biggest rules.

1. Talk to everyone. Don't assume brothers will come up to you. Talk to them to show that you're cool.
2. Don't be a dick head to girls. You never know who is the girlfriend or sister of an active.
3. Don't get too drunk. You'll look like a total asshat. 
4. Figure out who the rush chair is (if they exist at your school). At my school we elect rush chairs each year. These two guys essentially have the final say in who gets a bid as well as who is invited. Know them and be cool around them. 

What school do you go to if you don't mind me asking?"

Long term, if your wife can’t handle you speaking, get a divorce. Being silent is not a good way to live."
soc_110529,socialskills,reddit_comment,289,"Seriously?  Anything with which you are knowledgeable.  You could talk about pretty much anything (assuming it is appropriate in terms of how well you know that person), and as long as you know what you're talking about and talk about it with confidence, you're golden, Ponyboy.

You might ask me, ""LOJABE, how does one talk with confidence?""  Well, make sure that you actually you're well versed on the topic.  Next, say everything definitively without any kind of question-toning (i.e. raising your voice at the end of a sentence to sound more like a question instead of an answer).  Say it with conviction, be firm.  Don't be afraid to use/not use your hands.  It really doesn't matter unless you are going overboard (nearly hitting someone).

""LOJABE, what if the person looks bored with the topic?""  Who gives a fuck?  Finish with what you are saying whether or not that person is paying attention.  If it is interesting to you, but not to that person, that person can find a common interest as well, it's not all up to you.  Never...ever...stop mid sentence to check on the other person, it shows lack of authority, subordination, submissiveness, lack of confidence, etc.  Another thing, if it is obvious that the person isn't interested in what you're interested in, then it isn't your fault and you shouldn't cater to the other person.  If the other person is engaged with what you are saying, reciprocate with a showing of interest.  Take turns coming up with things to say.

Mostly, besides being an intellectual on a topic, be calm.  Don't seem too hasty to say what you want to say.  Say it with confidence, in a calm tone, and with a plethora of knowledge and understanding."
soc_66365,socialskills,reddit_comment,1057,"It's hard to say if people are born with confidence or not. I believe people aren't and like practicing the guitar it takes practice to be good at it. First off, think of confidence as something that everyone tries their best at it. Some give up on it some others make it their life long goal. 

For me I blushed a lot when talking to people, a lot. Mainly older adults. Blushing has left me feeling more embarrassed than I've should. I grew annoyed at my blushing because I would think people thought I had a crush on them or something when in fact I wasn't. I just pushed through the ""pain"" of blushing and did my best to ignore it. 

I wanted to find the root of my problem. I get social anxiety and anxiety in general. So what was I to do to overcome this phobia, I thought to myself. I always wanted to be an actor. So I pushed myself to act. I never acted in highschool but that's not the only avenue to pursue it. I took classes. It was hard at first but I grew comfortable. I worked at it until I got my first play or project. Boy these times were so hard to perform in front of people but I trapped that all inwardly and avoided sharing my true feelings to those I worked around. I just did it. 

Picking up the guitar helped me when I'm bored and/or needed to release some stress and I tell ya, playing an musical instrument relieved a lot of my stress. 

In my youth I was very awkward. I know what you are going through, feeling that everyone is talking behind your back. Fact is, people were talking behind my back. Even good friends. Family. They would talk negatively about me. It made me feel insignificant. However the pain still is there, I've learned that people will just be people regardless if it's you or them. People need to feel assurance by bath mouthing others. Let them. For you, it's all about not giving a fuck while still giving a fuck. Hard to do, but not too hard. What I mean by this is, don't let anyone affect you with their words, positive or negative. That's them making themselves feel good. That's not giving a fuck. But giving a fuck also means to make sure to say ""thank you"" and ""hello"" and all the other polite stuff. 

Being a good person has always made me feel proud about myself. Hey, sometimes I fail at being a good person, so forgiving yourself is also being good to yourself so don't forget to do that! 

So about you. Now it's hard to say what would be perfect for you since I don't know you. So it's up to you to figure out what you want to do. Sexuality should be the last thing on your list, heck don't even worry about that at all just yet. Sex will come when you find ""you"". 

Do you have a car? Go for road trips by yourself. Do you like reading? Read as many self help books as you can as well as other interesting fiction books. I recommend ""The Alchemist"". My favorite book I've ever read. Also here's a quick good read that I've found on reddit recently [link](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8407743/Authentic.pdf). 

Do you like working out? Set yourself up with short term goals that are achievable at first then reach out further. This goes with working out as well as life in general. 

Dieting. Making sure you're taking in the correct food source for you to get healthy in the mind as well as body. 

I pray. I'm a Christian. But I'm not your typical Christian bible thumper. I believe that everyone goes to heaven and that hell is a misconception created in the 1600's when the bible was first canonized. (Whole other topic for another day). But I'm sharing this with you because I'm going to recommend exploring yourself spiritually. I've found my source. Give this book a read. [Buddhism: Plain &amp; Simple](http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/301001291975?lpid=82)

There's just so much to share but I'm not the best writer or even have a plan formulated for you. Maybe look into seeing a counselor. Just so you can talk about your fears with someone. 

There's this book called ""The Artists' Way"". It talks about taking your ""inner-child"" on artistic dates. We are all children, but we've just grown to forget that. Finding your ""inner child"" is like being a kid again. Do things that make you feel good about yourself. Movie dates alone (I personally love this one). Going to bookstores alone and reading whatever you can find(another personal favorite). These could be great starters for you. See whatever movies you want if you can afford it. Library allows you to rent free movies. So get that library card! 

Remember, it's hard to drop everything all at once, so just gradually start doing these things. These are just my recommendations and even though you could try these things out as well, I still recommend opening your mind and heart to what your inner self starts telling you. You may not hear that voice right away, but once you start working at being by yourself and taking yourself out on dates, that voice will start to talk. Before you know it, you'll start exchanging inner dialog with yourself and you'll be questioning if you're insane or not(don't worry, you're not!). ;)

Once you've done this for a bit. Try going on a long trip. I recommend traveling across the country either by car or bus. Try to do most of your reading them. Avoid listening to as much music as you can. Just let yourself be in your head a bit. This will literally be your journey. 

Also write! Keep a journal of your adventure in self discovery! 

Sorry for making this so long. Hopefully this helps. :)

**TLDR - Reading books, going to the library, taking your self out on dates with nobody but you, taking a long road trip without listening to much music, exercise, dieting, being kind to others, not giving others too much, learning to give a fuck but also while giving a fuck, acting, music helps a great deal.

That's perfectly valid, and you don't need to justify that to anyone. (Of course, this swings both ways - someone may lose interest in you because of your lack of interest).

Personally, I also find astrology... tiresome, as a whole. I have zero interest in it, and I can't help but judge anyone who does take it seriously. Astrology has its benefits, don't get me wrong! It's great for anyone who wants peace of mind after they've made a decision. It's interesting. It's fun. But it should *never* be taken seriously.

Tbh I would also lose interest in anybody who put their star sign in their tinder bio, because I'd worry they're one of the... weird ones. You know - the crazy ones who use their star sign as an excuse to suck. I'd worry ""this is a person who makes bad decisions"".

It's probably not fair, but stereotypes rarely are. Unfortunately, when you only have a short blurb and a few pictures to judge someone, it's easy to refer to stereotypes to flesh out this person in your head before you decide to swipe left or right.

soc_1095409,socialskills,reddit_comment,469,"**Tip #1:** We should try to reference things that they said to us in future conversations. For example, if they bring up something about their desire to reduce their cell-phone usage, in a future convo we could be like, *""a while ago you mentioned that you were tryna' reduce your cell-phone usage and that got me thinking...""*. Essentially, we wanna signal to them that what they said to us is (a) being heard and (b) meaningful, impactful, etc., to us.

And there are a million ways to do this. Sometimes it's just asking them a question about something they said a while ago. Like, *""how did running that marathon feel?""*, after they told us they were ""registered to run a marathon in a couple days"", and this question we asked being situated some time after that.

Other times it could be us mentioning how something they said impacted our life, or contributed to a new thought we had. Like, *""man a few months ago you were talking about how worms sense light but don't ""see it""... today I just watched a documentary and this guy had an accident that caused him to see the world in frames, like photos, and that changed how he thought about the world... I wonder how different the senses are from person to person and how this effects how we see the world...""* or something like that. Connecting their past thoughts or ideas to our current, new thoughts and ideas.

**Tip #2:** We should be more vulnerable. Some people are afraid to open up because they are very conscious of their own flaws, shortcomings, problems, doubts, etc., yet assume everyone else has life and themselves under control. When we be vulnerable with someone who is reticent due to shyness, (*meaning, we speak to them about the things that bother us, the things we're struggling with, our emotions, our doubts, etc.)*, we typically make them feel more comfortable around us, because they then start to see us as a social equal; we break any inferiority complex they might feel around us. We also signal to them that, *""I'm not gonna judge you for your vulnerabilities""* since we're sharing some of ours with them.

These are things that I learned, analyzed, realized, when I was tryna' figure out what made this one friendship I had with someone so much more potent than the rest I had had in my life... why did I feel so comfortable to open up to him with my feelings, ideas, thoughts, doubts, battles, etc? And those two tips I just shared were things he just did. I dunno if he did it consciously or it was just his natural way of being, but it allowed me to open up to him and feel ""mentally and emotionally liberated"" when conversing with him."

That's just part of the process. Generally asking a girl out for anything 1 on 1 will at least put that thought in the back of her head, it's up to you to not make it awkward.

&gt; If I’m direct, and she says no, worst case scenario, I have an uncomfortable girl who will remain that way for a while. I want to keep talking to her minus the awkwardness of a rejection

Eh, rejection doesn't really have to be awkward either.

But answering your overall question, asking for a number can be a move depending on the context. If it's someone you literally just met, it's a move. If it's someone you've known for at least a bit, it can be seen as ""normal""."

Also, I’ve always been a big reader and love learning about new ideas, concepts, perspectives. So when I came across existentialism (way back when) I was super intrigued and have since then learned so much about that subject. Romanticism and Existentialism have impacted me so much because they let people “be ok” with being themselves and understanding that there is no higher power/universal truth. Everyone is entitled to believing whatever gets them through life!

So although I don’t believe that Camus’ line of thinking is 100% the end all be all, I am wildly interested in philosophy and alternate ways of viewing life. I love people and discussions so I think that expanding my world view is incredibly important because I will eventually enter a career (counseling/therapy) where I need to be diverse, patient, &amp; understanding of multicultural backgrounds etc. 

How about you? What sparked your interest in philosophy?"
soc_1358542,socialskills,reddit_comment,157,"You just summed up what I feel perfectly. I generally care about people and I don’t want to make it worse. So I’m super self conscious and super paranoid about how I respond to things. I find it weird to just vent unprovoked without seeking some kind of relatability. But everyone is different, everyone has different personalities and lived experiences, so sometimes we can’t completely avoid offending someone even while  having good intentions. I’d like to think that most intent is good and not self centered, but it’s impossible to scope out who might receive your form of help as negative. For example, youre walking home and see a homeless person and ask them if they need something. They say “fuck you, you think just because I’m homeless I need your help?”. You did the right thing objectively but you also offended someone. It’s difficult to gauge how someone will take a well intentioned but misunderstood response."
soc_1160706,socialskills,reddit_comment,146,"Always think of the bigger picture! In around 5 years time, their opinion won't matter - so it shouldn't matter now. 

If it helps, next time you see them try engage in a conversation perhaps so they get to know you more. Most of the time people judge without actually knowing the other person, and I'm sure you're a lovely person so they'll sure warm up to you after you've spoken to them! Even if they don't, the more compliments you give (make sure to not over-compliment though), the worse they'll feel from talking shit about you!

However, in no way, shape, or form should you change yourself to fit their ideal image of you. They may not like you, but your close friends and boyfriend do. And if it gets worse, drop them, not in a dramatic way, but just give the same energy back."
soc_198186,socialskills,reddit_comment,246,"Alcohol needs time to hit your brains. So don't drink too much too fast just because ""you don't feel anything yet"". That's also very important for the future. You may feel kind of sober and feel that you can take 2 more shots for example but then in 15 minutes you realize you're wasted.

Experimenting at home is a good idea so you get to know your limits without being out in the city, where you could be robbed etc. if you black out. The limit depends on many things, body weight, age, gender, genetics, etc.

I'd say for a thin 18 year old guy around 2 dl vodka over 1-2 hours would make you quite drunk. It could even make you puke.

Alcohol kind of raises your enthusiasm and makes you more open and think that people are interested in hearing what you have to say. You could perhaps listen to some enjoyable music.

Also get to know beer and wine, they are generally better than cocktails, but that's a personal preference. Cocktails often contain a lot of sugar and can make you have worse hangovers. And unless you make it yourself you can't really know how much alcohol is in there, so it's harder to keep track of how much you've drunk.

Also, don't forget to eat before drinking much, and remember to drink water once in a while while drinking, as alcohol makes you dry out which is the main reason for hangovers."
soc_872376,socialskills,reddit_comment,458,"My childhood best friend (3rd grade through senior year) 100% ghosted after confessing to the life she’d actually been living.
My parents called her their adopted daughter, her mom called me the same. She went on our family vacations - which was NOT a normal thing in my family. I can’t place enough emphasis on that. My parents neither could afford an extra body nor wanted the responsibility/discomfort. But she had become FAMILY. From 8th grade to junior year, I knew she was experimenting with things that I wouldn’t take part of. I knew she was more comfortable with boys than I was- by far. But I had no clue just how far she’d gone, until she admitted everything to me. We were going to bed, talking about the fun we planned to have that summer. She slipped and said ‘I’m going to have so much sex this summer!’ It wasn’t a joke. It wasn’t funny, either. She was not being responsible in any sense of the word. That was one of the last times we ever spoke. I couldn’t understand why for the life of me- I hadn’t berated or judged her. I only asked her to be careful and think about what’s best for her both short and long term. Now, I was no angel. Please don’t get me wrong. But I had boundaries that I stuck to. 
Fast forward 2 years. I run into her mom. She was working seasonally beside my permanent job. I was happy to see her but didn’t get the same reaction. She informed that she well knew what influence *I* had on her daughter, and what it had done to her. Told me that she moved to get away from the ‘bad’ people in her life- insinuating me and a boy she had admitted to sleeping with and smoking crack with (I’d never met him, still to this day -more than 12 years later- I’ve never smoked crack). I explained that I literally had NO CLUE what she was talking about and that frankly, if anything, she was a ‘bad influence’ on me. That I’d had nothing to do with any of the shenanigans she’d gotten herself into over the years. 
12 years later, all of her sisters seemingly still believe this crap. IT BROKE ME. It didn’t just break my heart, it broke ME. I had never been so confused, so mistaken, never been the ‘fall guy’ to this degree. We still haven’t spoken. I still think of her often. I still wonder WTF she would blame ME of all people. I still love her. 
I can honestly say this singular experience has burdened every relationship I’ve had since. I can’t fully trust, in any sense of the word."
soc_901803,socialskills,reddit_comment,302,"I had a very similar situation with my parents. Without social interaction during my teen years my mind reached a really dark place I didn’t know how to get out of. I was completely unadjusted to social situations, didn’t know how to act, how to react, had a bunch of fears, complexes, and I am still fighting some of my demons you know, but right now I am so far away from where I was 5 years ago. How did I do it you ask? By doing it. There is no other way, nobody else can do it for you — this exact realization made start acting on my fears, and also the fear of spending the rest of my life this way, that was the scariest thing. 

But you know the good news is you realize your problem, even if it’s a general realization so far - it’s a lot! Also yoga was smth that helped me a lot with this for the last few years, in fact, I think this was the most effective period of my development, so you might be interested to try if you haven’t already. 

Remember that it’s always your choice to make how you want to live your life, and if you choose to go against the stream and fight your fears, you’ll have a lot of questions and will need explanations sometimes and some kind of support, so if there is nobody you can rely on re this, feel free to PM me;)

In answer to your ending question I have to insist that you STOP thinking that you have to change yourself and least of all to do it to fit in.
Thank Gawd you're different. Revel in that. OWN it. BE it.
Ta heck with what anyone says. Unless you want to end up a clone automaton with no emotions and no joy, like the rest of the sheeple who suppressed their youth to fit in and became zombies to stay that way.
There's an energy game in life called ""If you get away WHAT will I do??!!""
A lot of people with no zest or individuality will see your ability and envy it, and do anything they can to get you to stop, because you make them feel bad by being in touch with yourself while they wander lost. The 'joiners' join because otherwise they'd be alone and the idea of that scares them to death. To be outcast is certain death in some people's minds and in tribal days it was, but these days we are allowed and encouraged to grow and become that which we are inclined to become.
School will be over before you know it, most of those students will vanish from your world (except for the joiners of course; you'll see them at the check out at the supermarket for the next 40 years because the supermarket has a good pension scheme) and you'll be left with your identity intact ready to continue being more you every day. Finding your certainty (confidence in yourself) and owning it is now the job you have despite the opposition and peer pressure to 'give it up' or 'git over yourself' or 'git yer haid out yo asp' or any number of other slurs aimed at chopping away at your self confidence.
The alternative would be that you mold yourself into something everyone wants you to be and then all those people with whom you have nothing in common would be your friends. THEN WHAT??
You want to hang out with these guys/gals?? Remember everyone is different. You have different Chinese and western horoscopes, different biorhythms, different genes, different parents and upbringing and many times different languages and customs. 
There will be plenty of time for you to develop your small talk and rapport, and your social image and presence has yet to blossom so kick back a little and just let the blooms come, you will be bursting all over the place if you honor yourself and believe in yourself. Be who you are, you'll do a better job if it than trying to be who you aren't. Would you rather be a little dark and mysterious or just a plain brown paper bag?
There's an old saying from the Rosicrucians I believe, 
 ""Know thyself, to thy known self be true, the Truth sets you free""

soc_125102,socialskills,reddit_comment,100,"I'm also the opposite of you. I find one on one conversations much easier than entertaining a group, where I feel people talk over me or ignore me. In on-on-one, it's easiest to start by asking the person questions about themselves, then asking them further questions about what they say or adding your own response to the question. Remembers the acronym **FORD: Family/friends Occupation Recreation Dreams.** Ask about whatever you think the person would feel happiest talking about, for example, ""So, how do you know X?"" or ""So what do you do?"" ""What do you do on the weekends?"" etc"
soc_949159,socialskills,reddit_comment,345,"More context is necessary. 

Replying with just “thanks” will generally be perceived as a conversation closer. The delivery would determine if it comes off as rude. If you say it with a genuine smile, it’s a polite way to show that you’re comfortable and not interested in engaging in conversation. If you say it sarcastically or in a monotone voice, it would usually indicate that you’re annoyed with their comment. 

Really, it depends on how you’re feeling and what you want to convey, as well as the other person’s social acuity. Most of the time, people will have enough self awareness to know “thanks” is a conversation closer, no matter the delivery BUT if they’re an extrovert like me and they really want to talk to you, they’ll respond to whatever you say with a joke and try to open a dialogue with you one to two more times. Your delivery will affect how many more attempts they make. (Assuming this is a situation without alcohol involved.) 

The most important thing is to determine if you want to talk to that person, and how you want to convey that message. This takes the focus off of how they will feel (they entered your space and initiated dialogue) and gives you power (making a decision). 

Suggestions:

Don’t feel like talking to them for whatever reason? “Thank you for noticing” with a genuine smile. (Then walk away or busy yourself)

Maybe feel like talking but you want to gauge they’re sense of humor and social acuity? “Thank you for noticing” with a playful smile and a flirty tone (if you think they’re attractive) or a natural humorous tone (if you don’t want to come off as flirty)

Do want to talk? Try something like “are you trying to change that?” Or “Thanks for noticing, you’re __________ (neutral obvious description of them) like brunette, or tall, or have blue eyes.) And laugh. 

Conversation is fluid, and you’ll figure out what comes out naturally vs. what sounds stiff or rehearsed as you interact with more people. 

Good luck :)"
soc_400210,socialskills,reddit_comment,1036,"Happy birthday love:)

I was stuck in a rut a few years ago, doing something I didn't enjoy everyday. It killed me on the inside. All my motivation and willpower was just: POOF. Naturally, my already shy self became shyer and shyer. I started trying to repel people purposefully so I'd never face rejection. It was a horrible coping method. I was sad, lonely and life was just grey. 

I can't isolate ONE specific measure I took to grow into the person I am today, but here's a list of things I did that may very well work for you:)

- Decide DEFINITELY that enough is enough: that you WILL change no matter how hard it was

- Engrave in your head (not literally LOL) that ""F A I L"" = ""First Attempt In Learning"" and that:
&gt;""It's not failure that destroys our confidence, it's not getting back up.""

- Think of every negative thought as an insect, make it a mission to SQUASH each and every one

- Taking a small risk EVERYDAY (the gravity of this risk is entirely up to you, it could be asking the Starbucks barista 'how are you?' when they take your order, just make sure it gets your heart thumping at least a little bit!!)

- Discover your hobbies/interests and join a group that take part in that thing
* *Did the clubs you joined revolve around something you cared about or just making friends?* *

- Fake it until you make it (body language), like: not averting eye contact, standing taller/holding shoulders back, trying not to fidget, etc

**- ENGAGING IN A SPORT/WORKOUT EVERYDAY (this made a HUGE impact for me as I would have fun doing it and also begin to see noticeable changes in my body over time, which later gave me the confidence to put effort into my clothing: ironic, I know)**
-- I started swimming (this can be done alone and in evenings, when not many people are around), kickboxing (GOSH it makes you feel like a badass), biking/walking instead of driving, dancing... but whatever is fun for you!

- To add on to the previous point: dressing well (I found that I did not want to APPEAR to put effort into my appearance and to intentionally look like I didn't care, to avoid judgement)
-- taking the sport/workout step was ESSENTIAL to do before this (for me personally)

- Invest in your scent !! no joke: smelling good = feeling good + knowing you smell good = small boost in confidence :D

- Re-evaluate your worries (will the risk of embarrassing yourself in front of that Starbucks barista affect you 1 year from now? 5 years? 10?)

- Treat others the way you want to be treated (be kind, helpful and dedicated), it's hard to dislike someone like that

- Set small, achievable goals, and once you crush them: CELEBRATE THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF THEM!!! :DDDD

- Catch yourself in the habit of complaining, replace with solutions and plans to fix your problems instead

- Remember: everybody is too preoccupied with their own worries and insecurities to notice yours (they don't care or think about you that much to be honest, MAY AS WELL just live your best life)

- Remember: nobody will remember your mistakes once you're dead and everyone will die eventually, why not make the most of this short life?

- Walk into a room assuming everyone's your friend (if you put yourself out there, you will UNDOUBTEDLY find someone who's compatible with you, if they don't like you, SO WHAT? They wouldn't have been a valuable friend to you anyways)

- Be grateful and show appreciation (write 3 things you are blessed with every week)

- Know that smiling will make you seem more approachable, friendly and welcome to new friends :)

- Do things you're currently procrastinating (boosts confidence!!)

- Volunteering and/or helping others NOT ONLY makes you more likeable but it fosters a sense of worth and a feeling of 'I put value in this world!' which leads to C O N F I D E N C E!!

- Clean your environment (clean room = clean mind)

- Accept compliments gracefully

- Work on being assertive, but respectful

- Trust that failure won't break you, but will only serve as a learning experience to ultimately make you stronger!!

**- DON'T. COMPARE. YOURSELF. You are the only person in this UNIVERSE who has the combination of experiences, skills and traits that you have. Realize that and let it embolden you**

- Don't be paralyzed by perfectionism. Stop thinking and just take the leap of faith.

- Act on your impulses within 5 seconds of having them (safely!!!!), actively count down if you need it

- FOR THE LOVE OF EVERYTHING: GET 7-9 HOURS OF SLEEP EVERYDAY
-- lack of sleep can lead to greater levels of depression and anxiety (TRUE TRUE TRUE x1000000)

- Get rid of negative sources, you DON'T need happiness leeches 

- Work on going up the need for others' validation or approval: they're just humans, like you. They make mistakes, like you.
&gt;""Those who matter don't mind and those who mind don't matter.""

- Isolate yourself from the scenario. Act like you're a character in a movie. What would you want that character to do? 

- Ask ""what would the strongest version of me do?""

- ALLOW yourself to be confident. Though cliche, the power REALLY IS 100% WITHIN.

- Replace ""I'm screwed"" with ""SCREW IT""

- Throw the phrase ""I can't ____"" in a fire and pee on it's smouldering ashes

- Don't be afraid to ask for help sometimes. Us humans, are very small and weak critters. We can't do everything alone. 

- And finally: live everyday like you were going to die tomorrow. What would matter to you then? What limitations would mean nothing to you?

If you have any questions/concerns/anything, don't shy away:) I used to be like this too, and now my friends can hardly believe I was ever ""shy"". I've developed so much by doing these things, I KNOW with all my heart that you can too!! :))))

Again: happy birthday bud! YOU CAN DO IT.

Just something simple that they couldn't prove. Or you can tell them straight up.  If you don't want their pity, then don't say it or carry yourself in a way that asks for it. 

Honesty is the simpler way to go about it, and if you choose to later, it allows you to easily spend time with someone else if they invite you. You will benefit more from just being straight with your coworkers and confident about your choice."
soc_211829,socialskills,reddit_comment,439,"I don't think any of us have enough information here. For  example, do you mean that not a single women has talked to you outside of professional settings? Or simply that there is no woman who you were not already acquainted with that checked you out?

If the latter, you might be missing something. Cues, confidence, expression, who knows. I'd imagine that your acquaintances have looked at you and talked to you, female or not. So you might be expecting something different than what reality presents you with.

If the former; you're either in a place, doing a thing, or associating with people that are not conducive to what you are seeking. Many relationships happen within social circles. For strangers to approach one another, it generally requires special circumstances or a particularly high confidence in one (or both) parties.

For example, if you have female friends/acquaintances that have never made a move as far as you can tell, that shouldn't be much of a concern. Could be them, could be the way you present yourself (not just style or posture - confidence isn't just a measure of how straight your shoulders are, its your smile, your laugh, your communication skills) or it could be that you've simply missed cues that they've given you. 

To be blunt, some of your comments in this thread seem dismissive, which implies a certain lack of awareness or maybe even a closed mind, which could lead to you not noticing such indications.

If you simply don't have female acquaintances/friends at all, then there's a bigger problem in your way then your face. To make any sort of connection with women, you're going to need to expand your social circle. How you do so is up to you - look hard enough and Reddit will provide you with all of the advice you could ask for, good and bad.

But, assuming that you're ugly because strangers don't look at you/acquaintances don't pay much attention to you... It sounds like a leap of logic. Maybe there are steps in between that we don't know. Maybe you've had people tell you that your personality is awesome. Maybe you've been called ugly. I don't know. All I know is, I don't follow the logic as it is presented here. 

I'm sorry if any of this came off the wrong way. I genuinely am trying to provide you with my perspective on the situation in the hopes of assisting you in finding a valid answer to your question. And, like another has said in this thread, maybe just ask people. The internet, real life people that you trust, whatever."

I’d say avoid clubs and public places like beaches since you can rarely tell social status at the beach to a degree and sugar daddy guys are past there clubbing days, try libraries or well off coffee shops and also try and find a way to meet these people at there home, How you do it is up to you, I’d say temporarily being a housemaid, massage therapist, carer, golf caddy would all work to get up and close with these people in there homes so you can form a relationship and know the money they have at the same time.

soc_593427,socialskills,reddit_comment,439,"Hey,

Please try not to beat yourself up so much. You’re so young, and socialising is very much a skill. I’m going to try and take a strange approach. I don’t know exactly what you’re doing that is preventing you from forming solid social connections, but if I honestly tell you what I like in a person I socialise with then maybe it will help you.

I (like many people) have a sense of humour. I love it when I’m around people who don’t take themselves too seriously, and can laugh at themselves. It’s worth noting that it becomes uncomfortable if a person begins to degrade themselves in a serious manner by pointing out aspects of themselves they clearly aren’t okay with. As a person with empathy, it makes me feel a bit depressed. This puts pressure on me to offer the person emotional support, which I don’t mind doing in moderation, but isn’t really fun. 

So in order of preference it goes:

1. A person that is forgiving of their own flaws and therefore can joke about a lot of different topics without getting upset.
2. A person who has hang ups about themselves but doesn’t always gripe about them, especially not in situations where people just want to relax and have fun.
3. A person who has hang ups and brings them up often in circumstances where people are trying to have fun.

It’s also really nice to be around people who take a genuine interest in me and my life. Almost everyone likes to talk about themselves, and as such people who actually listen and engage with what I’m saying are really pleasant to be around. 

I’m rather introverted and enjoy talking about things in a lot of depth. It’s nice when I can speak to someone and they’re open minded. Of course I’m not going to agree with someone about everything, but it’s really nice when me and a person can disagree without them getting angry and defensive. 

Generally it’s enjoyable to be around people who are positive and optimistic. So much of life is about interpretation. A person is either a winner or a loser based on your perspective. A situation is either hopeful or hopeless depending on your perspective. Being around people who look on the bright side allows me to also view my life in a positive light, and this helps me to feel good about myself.

Of course everyone is different, but I feel these things also apply to a lot of other people.

This is all I can think of at the moment. Good luck and keep your head up!"
soc_207292,socialskills,reddit_comment,113,"Okay, well let's solve the problem of less experience by making men the primary caregivers of children in order to enable women to achieve more years of experience that exists in their male counterparts.  Wait, that sounds pretty sexist too.

Cherrypicking data can also be said of your choice of extremely biased and opinionated articles as well, so that's kind of a moot point.

Forcing women into jobs they don't want to receive higher pay is an extremely generalized blanket statement that makes no sense whatsoever.  Career choices, including the choices of women is a highly subjective and broad topic.  Again, this doesn't help your argument in my opinion.

soc_787904,socialskills,reddit_comment,151,"I'm not Neu, so I can't say what they meant, but one thing that I try to remember is to just ask questions about things that people in your life enjoy.

And since they don't know anything about knitting independently of me, the questions sometimes don't make a ton of sense, but the trying to understand and learn more about something I enjoy really makes me feel appreciated. They're showing me they're interested in me and the things I like to do. I think it's the same reason you'll hear co-workers ask each other how their weekend was/whether they have any plans.

soc_1474197,socialskills,reddit_comment,661,"I think I have an idea for how you can approach this, but I have to say one thing first: you mention not wanting to change ""who you are."" I get that and it's a good ideal, but don't stick to it 100%. Human interaction requires a bit of flexibility and it's normal. If you want your friends to communicate your way, it's only fair to be willing to meet them half-way. This isn't ""changing who you are"" any more than if you behaved differently with your friends than at a funeral.


That said, I think your issue boils down to this line:

""I don't usually get everyone's 'all' back""


I think that might be your issue.


Some people simply don't or can't reciprocate that level of involvement.


First off, some people are just busy. School, extracurriculars, work, kids/siblings, family, other friends, health issues, etc all eat up a lot of time and motivation. I only see one of my best friends every month or two, in part, because they work night-shift. Another friend of mine simply has a lot of friends so they are often doing stuff with them. This doesn't mean they aren't my friends, it just means life gets in the way.


Another thing to consider is mental health. I know a lot of people with ADHD, Anxiety, Depression, etc (myself included) who have have to be coaxed into believing they are allowed to do what you are asking. Sometimes people with these issues might have come to believe themselves to be burdens and that asking people to spend time with them is an imposition. There are also people who simply are scared to reach out for similar reasons.


Heck, maybe you just talk too much about a certain subject for a specific friend's tastes.


Regardless of the reason, a good solution is to ask for clarification in a way that potentially puts the blame on yourself. Point out what they are doing in a way that asks ""am I doing something wrong? Is there a better time to text you? Am I being too much?"" You want to make sure you aren't coming across as judgemental. If the person actually cares about you (and can understand the nuance), they'll feel guilty about making you feel bad. In other words, you'll have gotten your point across!


Worst case is they say you are too much. If they try to be gentle with it and phrase it with care, take it to be mean that they like their alone time or just don't text as much as you do. Adjust your behavior accordingly. If they are blunt or rude about it, distance yourself.


A better scenario is the person just admits to being busy or not checking their phone often. Then you can discuss how to better communicate.


If the other person has a mental health issue or other hangup, this can be a great opportunity to offer to let them open up to you. If they accept, great! If not, you can at least discuss how much, how often, and by what means they are most comfortable interacting. (For the record; yes, the trope of an extrovert ""adopting"" an introvert can be a toxic cliché in some situations. If they are cool with it and you are both communicating openly, everything is good!)


Keep in mind that there can be some wiggle room here; if they are friends with you as-is they clearly are willing to tolerate your current behavior. If you aren't comfortable with what they want, maybe find some common ground where you are both reasonably comfortable.


TLDR: talk to your friends one-on-one. Approach them from a position of openness and honesty. Ask if you are communicating in a way they are comfortable with and, if not, what would they be comfortable with. Based on how they respond, decide if you two are compatible, discuss where you have common ground, and, again, be open and compassionate."

I also think that you've made up your mind that they are diametrically opposed because it fits your narrative of 'you against the world' better.

College and university was a whole new world to explore new hobbies, politics, studies, activities. Your entire twenties are the development of you as a person, only this this time you will be able to exert some form of autonomy on your decision making. It’s not without struggles, but the years ahead will be enjoyable and as long as follow your own advice on getting involved and putting yourself out there then you will be fine. Your perspective on age is relative, it’s how humans operate. You may think I’m ancient at 36, but I think you’re a child and that I’m relatively young 🤣, and when I’m 40, 50 will be the ‘new 40’and I’ll feel exactly the same way again. Set values based goals, things that have meaning to you as a person. Work on them, enjoy the journey, understanding that there is no ‘destination’. The journey is the important part.

soc_756787,socialskills,reddit_comment,169,"I agree, it's not your face, it's your attitude. Believe me, most people aren't that shallow to care about a face, that is, after you you start a conversation. Sure they may see you and assume, but if, as you say, you don't talk nerdy or act nerdy, then this thought would be dispelled as soon as you open your mouth and people will warm to you.  

Now, I'm not saying you act nerdy, I'm saying maybe (and you need to decide) you act in a way that makes people think you are 'weak' or 'awkward'. Maybe you're insecure, or you take bad assumptions into the conversation and want the other person to disprove it about themselves, rather than forming conclusions afterwards.  

I really don't believe it's your face. There are so many cues that go along with that: body language, posture, eye contact, confidence in any situation, the way you approach people, the way you talk etc. Maybe some of these are the problem? What do you think?"

It's up to you to draw the line and put the boundry up. You don't have to be harsh about it. It differs from situation to situation. If you have the guts to do it then show him this post. This post paints the picture really well from a neutral perspective. If not this post then reword it nicely and tell it to him face to face. It willbe akward but it's one of those 'rip the bandage off' scenerious. Don't leave him guessing as he probably won't come to the same conclusion you did on his own.

Theres nothing worse than watching somebody you truly care about get into a relationship with somebody else because then you’ll just end up hating yourself for not asking her out when you had the chance. 

You said that you guys started talking more which is good. Keep in contact this way you’ll be more comfortable talking to her. As for asking her out on Snapchat, that’s up to you. I’m more of a type of person that would ask somebody out in person instead of through snap but do what’s more comfortable for you. 

Also, do you two hang out or just text and talk through the phone? If you mainly just text or call her I would try to start making plans with her to hang out to make sure she’s actually comfortable with hanging out with you before you ask her out. 

If you two are already comfortable hanging out with each other them I’m not sure what you’re waiting for, listen to your friends and ask her out."
soc_182137,socialskills,reddit_comment,480,"Hey if it makes you feel any better, you sound just like me. Only difference is that I'm a guy.

I'm 23, I'm fairly attractive, I'm in a fraternity at a huge school, and I have a huge group of friends. From the outside, it would seem like I'm this extroverted social butterfly who gets along with everyone. But in reality, I'm incredibly shy, quiet, and introverted. I have a hard time connecting with people unless I put on a false personality where I become more talkative, outgoing, and confident. Usually with the help of alcohol. And that takes so much of my mental and physical energy that, frankly, it's usually not worth it for me.

So I spend a lot of time alone. The only people I interact with on a regular basis are my roommates, because we pretty much have to. It used to bother me a lot more. I would see my fraternity brothers, all textbook extroverts with seemingly endless amounts of energy, who are just so comfortable in social situations. Like they belong there. I've never felt that way. Like you, I've always felt that I'm forcing it. Putting on a façade that others expect of me. But that is just so draining. It got to be too much after a couple years. I had to step back and really think about what I wanted. 

So now I'm learning to embrace being alone. I'm learning that there are positives. I do what I want, when I want. I spend my time learning hobbies and skills like graphic design and music production, or just binge watching shows on Netflix. I worry about me and only me. The only thing that still gets to me is that I don't have a girl that I'm close to. No girlfriend, no long-term relationship history to speak of. That's tough to deal with, I'm not gonna lie. I can't help but feel a little jealous of couples who get to be so close to each other. A bed to yourself isn't always comfortable.

But I'm working on changing that mindset. Meditation helps. I also have a life coach that I talk to on the phone once a week. She listens to my issues and problems and helps me talk through them, helping me find solutions or just different ways of thinking, which helps too. But it's not for everyone.

Anyway, point is, you're not the only one who feels this way. Unfortunately, everyone else who does, doesn't want to talk about it. Myself included. My suggestion is to step back and really think about what you value in life. Do you value your social life enough to keep forcing a different personality? Or would you rather just be yourself, even if that means spending more time alone? That's your call. There's no wrong answer, but only you know what you want."
soc_1386355,socialskills,reddit_comment,475,"I was raised with both emotionally and physically abusive parents. And I had some definite anger issues along with diagnosed Severe Depression, ADHD, OCD, and PTSD. I was medicated for maybe 6 months, but the meds ended up making my anger issues way worse. So my father took me off them, and I was turning 18 at about that point. 

Me and my dad have talked a lot since that time, he was never a bad guy per say, his ex wife just constantly tried to make strife between us. And when she left while I was 18, everything in the house became a lot calmer and easier between us. My mother on the other hand, I haven’t talked to her since I turned 18, with the only exception being last year when my grandfather passed away. Otherwise, I just don’t care to talk to her.

I eventually had to realize that it was up to me to let things in my life control me or not. I spent maybe 3 years trying to better myself, anger being a fairly hard hurdle of my life, but really it just came down to me not allowing myself to act on anger impulsively. Now I’m a lot more controlling of my emotions. So much so, that when me and the misses get in a fight, I can stop mid argument (arguing is really rare for us) and apologize for being a dickhead and start the healing process a lot sooner. It sometimes freaks her out that I just don’t hold grudges at all. 

As for my depression, that was hardest for sure, I dealt with that till I was 20 or 21. Part of me liked having it, it was comforting to feel lonely and sad. Part of me wanted my life to be miserable in hopes to get a book or movie written about me being “oh poor killzone989898, he had such a terrible life.” And I kinda just wanted to stay there. However, meeting my now wife when I was 20, she was 28 and had a 3 year old. I realized I couldn’t be that dramatic self centered asshole pretty quickly. And after a year, I had just moved on in my life. I’m 24 now, been working security for hospitals for the last 3 years. Losing weight to join the military in a few months, guess I just kinda l outdoor jobs. But over all, I’d say stuff like what I grew up only controls and sticks with you if you allow it too. If ya fell in pig shit, you can either get up, clean yourself off, and move on. Or you can wallow in it and throw a pity party and stay there. It is up to you in the end. I’m just glad I found my way out early on."
soc_99996,socialskills,reddit_comment,387,"Hey man,

I think I PM'ed you - if I haven't reached out to you yet, make sure I get you a copy of the book.

One of the things I point out at the beginning of my book is how reading self help books is a great step forward...and even more important than that is taking action. Taking action is the #1 best way to learn as you apply new information from your mistakes and experiences. When I started reading a lot of self-help books, I felt like my journey was over...that I already knew as much as I needed to and my life was going to magically be wonderful. Remember - it's a process. The book is just a map of the territory...it is not THE territory. It is your guide and companion...but not the road.

It is up to you to stay on the road...to stay on the path of growth. That comes from putting yourself out there and the willingness to make mistakes and stumble.

I would strongly suggest knowing why you are VALUABLE and writing it down. What makes you a valuable friend? What skills or passions do you have? Have you traveled? What experiences do you have that make you interesting? Know these inside and out - they will give you a lot of confidence. And then on a daily basis, continue expanding that value. Become an expert in something you're passionate about. Read more books, yes...and listen to podcasts, watch videos, go to seminars..you get the idea. Soak in as much information as you can. 

The most valuable information you can be passionate about is information that helps people solve problems - relationships, money, marketing, business, health, happiness. Find ways you can help people solve these problems. Offer solutions, give them gifts, point them in new directions...this makes you a valuable friend. Just don't emotionally LEAN on them for approval. Don't be the kind of person that NEEDS friendship. Be the kind of person that would be totally cool on his own or hanging out with friends. Have strong boundaries...know what you won't tolerate from others - so if a friend acts way out of bounds, you're not going to sacrifice your own values for the sake of a friendship. This makes you a stronger person and a precious commodity."
soc_717990,socialskills,reddit_comment,141,23 here and I haven’t dated either. Relationships are hard work. Don’t trust anyone who tells you otherwise lol. You’ll find your fit and you’ll experience the cute romance you’ve described one day. Keep pushing and focus on yourself. Don’t drain yourself by thinking about it so much. Rather do something useful and improve. Get out of your comfort zone from time to time and you’ll notice life throwing opportunities at you. Now whether you want to act upon them is up to you. Look into relationship advice / the game so that you know what to expect. Study personality types /mbti/ to understand people better and avoid conflict. Check your ego at the door. Shape your standards. Think about the trade offs you’d be faced to make as you get to know the person better because not everyone is perfect.
soc_667317,socialskills,reddit_comment,605,"Let me go over what has helped me. I'm going to break it down into two main categories.

Self:

\- Have passions. (Make sure there are  topics you are excited to discuss and share with others. If you do not yet have thigns you enjoy, this takes priority as it is important for your health.)

\- Have ethics. (Make sure you have your own set of morality from which to base your interactions with other people. This is something that I personally value very much but others may not. It is up to you whether or not you wish to disregard this.)

\- Look decent. (This one is a real pain in the ass but extremely important. If you look like shit you will be treated like shit. It shouldn't be so but it is. Pay attention to how you dress, groom, and exercise. If two people are equally amicable, the good lucking one will appear more likable.)

&amp;#x200B;

Others:  


\- Others can be broken down to one major ideal and then several methods to achieve this ideal. Here is the ideal: EVERYONE WANTS TO FEEL VALUED. 

\- So... how do we make others feel valued? There are a lot of ways. Master these to start.  
1. Look people in their eyes. Yes, it matters.  
2. Smile at them. Practice your smile. No , easily seen through BS smile. Learn to believe your own smile.   
3. Talk to them about their interests. There is no way easier way to get others talking then to talk about their interests. This is harder than it seems . Don't just go, ""what do you like... oh that's cool."" Find their interests and speak in a way which is meant to have them as a mentor and you as a disciple. ""Wait, so you are a surfer? Oh, that's amazing I've always wanted to surf! Where do you surf? That's the beach with all the taco places right? Oh my god, I fucking love that place. So you're one of those super fit people I  see surfing all the time while I'm pounding fish tacos, huh?"" etc, etc, etc. It takes a LOT of practice to get good at this. You are going to seem very fake initially but once you get good you can talk with anyone.   
4. Compliment them sincerely (flattery doesn't count.) Find something you admire about the person that is neither shallow nor against their values and take earnest notice of it. There is a coffee place in front of my work. Everyone goes there before heading in and one of the girls there has one of the most stunning smiles you will ever see in your life. One day she hands me my coffee and I tell her this. I go, ""You know, (name), you honestly have one of the best smiles I have ever seen in my life. Sometimes I think I'm coming here to see it rather than the caffeine. This was true. We text each other now.   


Here is the deal mate. You're young and you have a lot of life to learn. I didn't learn these lessons until my ass had been whopped ten ways to Sunday. I still have a lot to learn. Nobody is ever the perfect statesman and the best are constantly practicing. Abraham Lincoln used to write down his negative thoughts rather than expressing them. Reagan took notes on subjects he didn't understand that he knew his friends cared about. The both of them studied OTHERS andcared about OTHERS. They slowly perfected the art of making those others feel valued.

soc_286076,socialskills,reddit_comment,298,"If you really love him with all your heart, you will regret ending things. It sounds like your personalities complement each other really well and that the issue is, you're on kind of an ongoing self acceptance journey. It's not easy! For a lot of us, it's never really over. Your SO sounds like someone who is really accepting and can understand and support you as you go forward. It also sounds like he knows the real you and doesn't really care what impression other people get from ""social anxiety you."" 

As far as your family goes--have you tried talking to them about how you feel? If there are one or two family members you feel closer to or more comfortable around, tell them it hurts your feelings that they reach out to him instead of you. If it's a matter of social anxiety getting in the way of ALL your family relationships, maybe they just need to know. One thing I struggle with is that social anxiety sometimes makes me come off like I don't like people. Your family members might think you're not interested in THEM and it can make a vicious cycle unless you take a step to try and break it. 

Don't worry too much about the Facebook thing. I really think it's just one of those things some people are good at and some people aren't, like telling good jokes or cooking or whatever. My husband is great in person (sometimes, ha) but his Facebook is like a ghost town, he's just not great at sensing what people will and won't respond to or captioning something in a way that makes it understandable to anybody but him. It doesn't actually reflect on your worth as a person or friend if that makes sense. "
soc_1192112,socialskills,reddit_comment,498,"Hey there! I kinda face the same problems as you especially when I was younger. I didn’t know how to connect with male counterparts as they felt ”different” from me. 

The vibe that they give was somewhat more open and direct. It was hard to understand their point of view and sometimes the things that they do may not interest me or go align with my beliefs. Some of them might even see me as a quiet person who is more nerdy and doesn’t like to play sports or games that require more physique. However, it is not always true as I play Badminton and play mobile and computer games before! I Guess it’s just the personality that does not fit in. After being through in army, I‘m more clear on how male culture works and I feel that most if not some of them are absorbed into this culture, be it toxic or not. 

For me, I trust myself and I will continue to present myself as who I am. I do not need to please my male counterparts and act like them because nobody could actually take charge of our lives, could they? 

At the end of the day, people like to be related and felt understood. People usually get together because they got a common identity which could be fostered through similar behavioural traits, culture and overlapping beliefs. If one wants to make a genuine friend with the other, he/she has to reach out and take initiative while being open-minded. I wouldn’t want to just get absorbed into that “common identity” unless it is necessary for work/official purposes. (one advice tho: don’t get too polite/go by the book as it wouldn’t work too — does not come off as real/sincere unless one manages to keep it constant through his/her true personality)

Everyone is different and we have to accept that. Only by accepting others as who they are, will friendships really blossom and not merely chasing for a common identity or something that can be related. We can talk about them, yes, but not something to be hold onto if one doesn’t like it or have other preferences. 

Staying true to ourselves is the best friend that we could personally offer and keep it natural. It’s all about the sincerity and quality of friendship. Don’t force yourself to make friends with the other party, just so to cover the needy feeling of wanting a friend. It’s never going to work unless it comes from the sincere mutual effort that yearns to know him/her more which creates a new chapter in your life with that person. Not every chapter is the same. It could be one that turns from friendship into relationship. Or one that turn from friendship into betrayal. Are you ready to flip the pages of your story in your life? 

I’m working towards that right now but one step at a time, as I’m pursuing different hobbies and continue to work on self-improvement."

soc_295198,socialskills,reddit_comment,257,"&gt; maybe you know why I think about myself like this?

That's different. I've never heard anyone say that until this morning. I wish I knew. All that I can do is toss out a maybe and you've probably already thought of this.

&amp;nbsp;

Whatever it is, it's probably something quite deep, given the fact that you're not even sure yourself. This seems like a complete reversal of the feelings that are typical of being positive, it's as if you have negative association with being positive. But this is only the surface, what lies beneath only you know.

&amp;nbsp;

Going with your phrase ""immoral"". The first thought that comes to my mind, is that maybe you see being positive, when you're not, as a form of dishonesty. For example, it has been proven that if someone is sad, and they force themselves to smile, that it can make them feel better. This is because we have an association with smiling with being happy. But it is true, that a forced smile is not an honest smile. However, it can become a real smile, once forced. I'm not recommending this BTW as I've never been a fan of it, it's better to start internally and work out, imo.

&amp;nbsp;

But the truth is, I only have that one vague idea as to why you think this way. Do you always think this way? What if you are genuinely positive for a moment, does it still feel immoral, not as an exercise to combat negativity, but just naturally positive?

"
soc_800478,socialskills,reddit_comment,256,"I know the struggle of “feeling alone in a crowded place,” and what I’ve found that works best (for me, everyone is different) is to force myself to ask questions, even when I genuinely don’t care to know the answer;

“Hi! What’s your name? I’m (*your name*), it’s nice to meet you!”
“Where are you from?”
“How did you meet (*name of mutual friend*)?”
“Where do you go to school? What’s it like there?”
“What are you studying? What do you want to do with that degree?”

The important thing to note is that by asking a simple question, it’s easier for introverts to strike up a conversation in this manor because it requires minimal effort on your part and they’ll do most of the talking. But, be prepared for them to return fire, at which point the initial fear of initiating conversation is over, and you may find it much easier to carry on the conversation. They’ll feel like you’re genuinely interested in getting to know them, and you won’t feel like a “background friend.” It may take a little digging to find something in common with them, but once you find it, stick with it. Even if the only commonality is knowing that mutual friend, you can all swap stories (embarrassing ones are great conversation starters)

Someone once told me a little piece of advice that I’ll never forget; When being introduced to new people by a trusted friend, they think you would all make great friends, so there’s no reason to believe otherwise."

If you haven't and your grades are bad, it's most likely you won't get into a ""good"" university.  That's the just the consequences of decisions made.

Granted, not getting into a ""good"" university doesn't make someone an automatic failure.  Failure is always based on your decisions, not on your circumstances.  If you give up because of your circumstances, then yes...you will become a failure.  But that was your choice to make.

If you choose to rise above your circumstances, then that's how one succeeds, grows, and becomes stronger.  Again...it all comes down to your choice."

soc_1674157,socialskills,reddit_comment,308,"Look… you’ve had TONNES of advice from being online. We’re all strangers and can’t see you or know you, so the advice is very limited and necessarily vague. You seem to think you’ll find a magic formula that guarantees success, but that’s not how it works. Only YOU can figure it out. I learnt how not to be shy by becoming a waitress which forced me to interact with people. I’m not suggesting that’s for you, but that’s what I did (long ago, before internet existed). I worked hard at it, read books, watched people who I thought were warm and friendly. Very importantly, I worked on my own self-esteem. I got used to rejection so it wasn’t personal, and I accepted when people would talk to me as it was because I was worthwhile, rather than being grateful. It’s a gradual process. 

I’m also interested in knowing about things that don’t interest me. Sometimes I’m right, sometimes I learn something new. I like people. My liking people in general never means they have to like me back. 

You need to stop being a victim and also stop thinking that just because you went up to someone means they have to talk to you. I used to suffer from victim mentality, and still have to be aware of it. It’s stupid, and quite narcissistic. The world really doesn’t care about you that much. The person who was rude to you will have forgotten about you forever in 10 minutes. The ones who laughed at you have already moved on to something else. It’s really no big deal. Being a victim means you always put yourself at the centre of everything, helpless against all the world is throwing only at YOU. It’s not true, and not that interesting to most, and definitely not interesting to strangers unless they’re therapists."

If it were me I would go with my first plan simply because I try to be a person of my word.  IF I could find away to include my friend that I made plans with then I would go to the second one.  Send birthday card and apology to the other birthday person explain I had previously made plans, but my invitation to their party came too late.  

The main goal is to make sure you're honest with everyone
No matter what you choose to do. 

But the first friend ""canceling on you several times.""  Does not make you canceling OK.  If you didn't like it then you shouldn't do it or do it back?  Two wrongs don't make a right?  Might make it even,  still doesn't make it right.. 

So, questions to ask yourself?  Biggest one,  if all of these people were me and I was them how would I feel the best way to handle it is??.. Then imagine you are each one of the people who maybe hurt or angry by your decision.  What kind of friend do I see myself as?  Am I the kind of friend I look want to have or am I the kind of friend others want to have? Am I an honest friend?  Do I have integrity?  Is a birthday all about doing what you want?  

I can tell you for me?  A birthday is nothing, without the people closest to me to share it with."

I think The Rock Johnson has had some pretty feminine roles but he's huge so it's still hot. It's not that you're bad the way you are, but here's been my experience. I actually dated a pretty feminine guy (wore scarves, very fashionable, feminine voice and mannerisms, feminine hobbies (didn't work out either) and complained about his diet. That's not really a woman thing, but you hear a lot more women doing it than men. I guess if you just take action in your life and try to work out I think your dating pool will be much wider. There's some sort of biological impulse towards strong men. I dated two neutral type of guys, then I dated a macho type of guy, and I dated one feminine guy and he was straight or at least he said he was so I shamed myself and ended up dating him because I didn't think it was a legitimate reason to not date him because I felt like I was awful for judging or something. He actually had multiple homosexual affairs throughout our relationship. So I'm not saying every single effeminate guy will do this, but never again will I date an effeminate guy and I even told one guy a couple months ago that I wouldn't date him because I needed somebody more rugged, I'm from the south and I'm really attracted to that rugged masculine outdoorsy type with the truck and the hunting and the fishing etcetera, Carhartt. He was devastated or angry and I really didn't mean to insult him I was just trying to tell him that it wasn't personal it was just personal preference. but never again am I going to date someone who I think might cheat on me with a man and I'm thinking that that's the biological impulse for a woman to select a mate that is most likely to stay with her. Not that you would ever do this but I think that's the biological impulse. So just try working out to gain muscle, be as feminine as u want but maybe buy a masculine coat and shoes. Unless you don't want to, but you posted here for advice. I would say that the coat and the shoes are the things that I look at the most. it's not that I'm sitting there with a checklist trying to determine if this guy is worth dating based on his coat, I'm just talkin about the biological reaction turned on or off. I had to stop dating somebody who had the habit of wearing a peacoat, peacoats and scarves always end up looking feminine. Solid color, non fringed scarf is fine. He also wore pointed-toe shiny dress shoes which looked very... Gay! I'm sorry! It's not about the shoes or the coat or the muscles it's about biological impulses I think. I'm just giving you advice on how to widen your dating pool. Alternatively, don't change a thing, and look for women with short hair and colored hair. Literally 100% of my friends whose type is skinny effeminate guys have short and or colored hair. Or overweight women . I see a lot of overweight women coupled up with short or thin or feminine looking men. Alternatively you could just hold out for that perfect person but that's your choice."

I don't believe I'm in denial, but I'm not going to say that it's impossible. I have the opposite of that mentality. One of the biggest personal pushes I had to make this post was because of what another poster mentioned. Despite the fact that, like I've said before, I truly believe I'm not arrogant or the other things I've mentioned, if *everyone* else sees it, then it *has* to be me.

They don't understand there is a reason I do that. Because I know what they don't know, I just chuckle or make a joke about it and move on. They see it as me laughing with them when I am laughing at what they don't know. This approach may help you deal with your situation. Accept that they are not you and may not understand why you do what you do. You can laugh at this or you can take the time to explain it to them, which may backfire and result in more of the same. 

Ultimately, all you can do is be the best you. If they think that is a joke, you have to decide if you want to stay in that type of toxic setting or move on to something better?"

soc_1433177,socialskills,reddit_comment,292,"i feel the same, and something that i’ve struggled with is being okay with being by myself with out being cynical about it, or internally blaming other people for my loneliness - which is kind of embarrassing to admit. i’m 23, and college was an ambiguous time for me - temporary friendships and failed romantic relationships and a heck ton of projects and assignments that kept me from a social life, the usual. 

it got to a point where my family was begging me to get out of the house and pursue “friend dates”… i did not enjoy those.

i eventually had a successful “friend date” although there was drinking involved, and moving forward i often felt that i had to be drinking or drunk to engage with them, otherwise they would have “true me” who is extremely depressed and anxious.

i’ve reduced my drinking dramatically, and i’ve been in kind of a rut - however, i’ve been building myself up with little things: going to events, restaurants, movies, etc. by myself. doing things i enjoy. 

the main thing that i realized is that i’m never going to find anyone with the exact same likes/dislikes to check off. people are too different in a good way. i spend the majority of my time alone. i have a couple of different friends amongst groups with differing interests. if i feel like being social, i’ll engage, and if not, i just roll with whatever i feel like that day.

people come and go, but you’ve gotta live with yourself regardless. and i’ve come to recognize that it’s okay to be my own friend and the loneliness also comes and goes. i think it’s just part of growing i guess. but again, everyone is different."
soc_178591,socialskills,reddit_comment,164,"The way to go usually lies somewhere in the middle. When they say not to minimize the copliment, saying ""thanks,"" while a minimal response, isn't what they mean. They mean, don't make it sound like you didn't deserve the compliment.

Try to set your state of mind as being just a mere observers in these interactions. Hopefully that will ease your uneasiness. Pay attention to topics or subjects that relevant to day-to-day with your local folks.  It is perfectly fine to just be quiet and softly smile and nodding at what talking.

Look up on some tips on how to read body language could be helpful too. This way you can quickly tell if a person feels comfortable to interact with other people or if he/she wants to be left alone. Don't over-analyze on how people would think of you. As long as you don't say something offensive to other people, you should be fine (the catch here is that it is not up to you to decide what is offensive to a person).

However, avoid getting into religion and politics at all cost unless you and other people are in more laid back environment.

Value them more as a person than you value them as a potential romantic partner?
Crushes are weird, right. There's this flood of neurochemical and hormonal stuff that happens inside you when you have a crush on someone. It feels different in your body when you have a crush on someone, rather than just being their friend.
You can't decide your way out of a crush, because the dopamine and oxytocin are still going to rush into your blood supply when you see them or think about them. Your sex hormones are still going to start circulating. And that stuff stays in your blood stream and in your tissues for a while, whether you decide it 'should' be there or not. 

So it takes time. 
You have to let yourself feel the feelings, but they usually don't last forever. And the amount of time will be different person to person. 

And you have to decide if the person is so wonderful that you want to be their friend forever. 
I mean... If they are, then you probably still want to get with them. And if they aren't, why do you want to get with them?
I don't know things. Least of all how your situation is. Maybe they're into you, and you're letting something wonderful go by. If they are into you, how would you know?

* The people who make fun of you and think you in a particular way actually have problems themselves, it may sound silly I didn't believe this too but it really is, when people see danger coming their way they make fun of others and judge them in order for them to feel better.

* Be confident in yourself, if you think you're doing something right do it without changing your decision because of others opinion of you.

* Learn to control your emotions, try to be more logical instead of being more emotional. (Movies made a big impact on us)"
soc_872396,socialskills,reddit_comment,500,"I think the first thing to do is to decide whether you want to be more extroverted or if you want to stop being jealous of extroverts,  because you can't do both at the same time. You can't appreciate your introversion (thus, stopping to be jealous) if you try to change yourself. 

Being introverted is not a bad thing. Why do you want to become more extroverted if you feel fine spending time alone? If you enjoy your time when you're not with people, then you're not missing out on anything. If you do not want to go to parties, why do you feel like it would be better to go? Being introverted doesn't necessarily mean that your social skills are bad, and you shouldn't force yourself to be what you aren't. Reading your text, I couldn't help but feel that you force yourself to want something you don't want (if that makes sense). You don't want to hang out with people, but if you don't, you feel like a loser. Why? I mean, I know the feeling. I'll never in my life be an extrovert, and I very often feel like my surroundings evaluate my introversion as a bad thing. But it's natural for an extroverted person to think so, because for them, being with people is desirable. Unless they understand that this is not the case for you - that you enjoy your time alone or with a few best friends just as much as they enjoy their party-time - they are going to falsely deduct that you are missing out on something. Don't make the same mistake. There are a lot of people trying to be extroverted, (because in this world, we have to constantly prove and present ourselves), even if they aren't. That can make you very unhappy. In the end, only you know what you enjoy and what you want to do and you shouldn't let yourself be pressured by others. Or more, by their conception of what is good and desirable. 

Still, this is only my opinion, and if you really want to be an extrovert (think about it, do you really want to be an extrovert? Or do you feel like you have to?) , then, honestly, I don't know, I don't think I could change that part of me. Of course you can train interacting with people and you can improve your social skills (which is useful even if you are an introvert, and being introverted doesn't mean that you're not socially competent.). But I don't know if you'll ever enjoy it as much as an extrovert would. It's good to be able to communicate with people and be social and likable when you talk to them, but you don't have to be extroverted in order to do that. 

Sorry for the long answer (I had a rough time, too, coming to terms with my introversion). I really hope you figure things out and I wish you all the best. 

Stay safe!"
soc_143035,socialskills,reddit_comment,422,"I used to be you man. I am still not a great dancer by any means. Maybe I'm even really bad still, but I have a great time when I go out. Short of learning some actual dance moves through professional instruction (which I did not do), here are some tips.

Get over your fear. You said you have something come up where you can go that no one will ever see you again. PERFECT!!! Just dance. Just move to the music. Watch the people around you. Look at what parts of their body they move. The fact that you're going to some sort of concert (I assume that's what it is) indicates you're not totally musically illiterate, so just move to the beat.

In order to not look like an idiot, you've got to move parts of your body that won't feel natural at first. You are going to feel like an idiot, I guarantee it, but it's okay. In order for anyone to notice, you will have to be so horrifically bad that you're crashing into people and losing your balance. Move your arms and shoulders and hips. And do something with your feet. Imagine you're tap dancing (whatever you think that is supposed to look like). I'm not kidding about that. 

As you get into the rhythm of it and get a feel for the song that's playing, you'll find yourself doing some repetitive motions to certain parts. It'll be stuff you just made up on the fly, but no one will know that. Just repeat it every once in a while and it will look like you know what you're doing.

You can also ask around to see if anyone has any ecstasy (KIDDING!).

But seriously. You will feel ridiculous at first. When someone tells me ""I don't know how to dance"" all I hear is ""I feel really awkward when I dance."" That's normal. You will feel absolutely silly. But no one really gives a shit what you do as long as you are moving more or less to the beat and look like you're having a great time. That is another important thing. Don't just dance with a straight face. Show some emotion, smile a bit. As the show goes on you will start to feel like you have a grip on it. I guarantee that if you keep it up the whole time, you will have it down by the halfway point, and you will have a great time. Let us know how it goes!"
soc_138689,socialskills,reddit_comment,216,"Got it. I apologize for not realizing your circumstances.

Personally, I believe 4 should always be your choice of action in life, regardless of the level of your social skills. My reason for this is that in life, especially in regards to your social life, can be very hard and, sometimes, cruel. As a result, you might be depressed and lose a sense of connection with the world for their mistreatment of you. So you want to to develop a hobby in which you can say something like, "" You know, things might not be going the way I want, and they may not become better soon. But you know, I have this hobby that gives me life in the world."" Basically doing 4 and keeping at it would be your safety net.

As for the other two, I think 2 would be easier (or less difficult to do) due to the fact in clubs people are generally there to socialize. The people in 1 are kind of ""ehhh""  to people they don't know :) But if you do 1 at some point in your life, make sure that the reasons you are giving compliments is because they are genuine, and not something in which you giving the compliment solely for the sake of giving compliment."
soc_150274,socialskills,reddit_comment,495,"I had a terrible flatmate for a year when I was at Uni. Absolutely terrible. He'd leave a puddle around the toilet and not clean it up, didn't understand the concept of personal hygiene, and most certainly couldn't help with household cleaning. I swear to god the only times his room got cleaned that year, were the monthly visits from his mother, who would clean his room, and buy him a weeks worth of ready meals for his dinners.

Whilst I hated it at the time, and was so unbelievably glad to be out of there, it improved me as a person. It made me more patient, more tolerant, and a damn site more independent. I learned a lot about being an adult that year.

Having a bad flat mate is on the list of things that everyone should do once, alongside having a job they hate, and working in the service industry. It makes you a better person for anyone else you will ever live with.

The only way to sort issues like these out is through communication. Choose a couple of things and speak to him, in a serious, adult fashion about them. Offer compromises where possible. For example, he wants to wear boxers around the flat, you want him fully dressed. How about if he wears a bathrobe over his boxers? Or if he wears joggers rather than boxers, but is still topless? 

If you can't change him through direct communication, then try passive communication. Leave notes on doors such as ""Please remember to remove your shoes"" next to the front door, ""please refill the pitcher"" on the pitcher/on the fridge, ""please only use pitcher water"" on the kettle, ""please dress decently"" on the door to the living room, that sort of them.

On another note, there are a few things you've listed that are completely unreasonable. Bringing mugs and glasses into the bathroom...thats just personal preference. If you have a favourite mug, ask him to make sure and never take it into the bathroom. But other than that, they're his mugs as much as yours, he can do with them what he wills. 

Tap water isn't going to damage your kettle, at all, unless you live somewhere that you shouldn't be drinking the tap water. In which case, you wouldn't be putting it in the kettle.

Him wearing shoes around the apartment shouldn't make any difference, unless he's trekking mud etc around the place. I don't get why you'd have an issue with him wearing shoes in the flat?

One man's slamming a cupboard door is another man's letting it close on its own. Unless he is actually throwing them closed, I'd let that one go. You obviously want a really quiet environment, but sometimes you have to compromise on that sort of thing.

Also, how do you know he doesn't wash his hands after using the bathroom? Its a bit weird you're paying such close attention to his bathroom habits."

soc_33385,socialskills,reddit_comment,267,"It's one of those things that you just have to do. Practice makes perfect so to say. 

It's something that is easy to recognize in other people. Stop and analyze in that moment what about them exudes confidence and then emulate but also customize it to yourself. 

Also being confident doesn't necessarily mean the show needs to go on at all times. You can also be the quiet person in the group but still show confidence when you chime in. 

Practice taking charge of simple situations. You have a group of friends that seem indecisive on where to eat? Instead of doing the whole ""I don't care, it's up to you thing"" make a decision right then and there. If it's shot down make another decision and through it out there. 

Hanging out one on one or with a group and everyone is bored? Have something in mind that you would like to do but not sure how the other person would react so you keep quiet? Whatever, get it out there. Chances are they'll be down. 

Remember though confidence != cocky. Confidence is attractive, cockiness not so much, so be careful to look out if you are headed towards those waters. 

If you are looking for tips on how to be confident with strangers that can be a little trickier as those situations are quite dynamic and the variables can be interesting to keep up with. Again though observe, reflect, and emulate and you'll probably establish a pattern. It may sound weird but reading stories in /r/seduction gives me lots of tips in handling different situations. "
soc_156926,socialskills,reddit_comment,1019,"Hi Pyote5

It's taken me a few days to put together this reply, so sorry it's a bit late, and I hope some of it helps you.

It looks a little like my reply is a slight contravention of some of the /r/socialskills community guidelines, but it also seems like your problem isn't with social skills, which you've admitted you have had some regular practice with recently, but the isolation from not feeling very good about yourself.

It is partly written for my own benefit, because I'm also struggling to remember these things today, I think I've been through some fairly similar experiences to you, although I'm writing this at age 33 and I've only just started working on these issues in myself. I can't help but wonder what my life would have been like if I'd taken more of this on board while in college - I'll give it a shot, even if I am just projecting my mental state onto you and the below is of no help.
  
  
To start with, it's a fairly simple truth, but one that is really easy to forget, and can be pretty painful to admit.

We are responsible for our own experience of life. No-one else, just us. I find myself regularly blaming my experiences for making me the way that I am, and wondering how other people can find it so damn easy, and regularly need to step back and remind myself of the above.
You seem to be getting frustrated with the amount of help that therapists are able to offer you, but unfortunately they can't snap their fingers and make it all better - they're just people too, doing the very best that they can. The medication or meditation are just tools to help you try to feel more positive or to introspectively look at your own life, some of which you're already doing.
This isn't to say that I disagree with you and that the field of psychotherapy couldn't do with some changes, but ultimately the responsibility lies with us. It's like the old joke about how many therapists it takes to change a lightbulb - just one, but the lightbulb has got to want to change.

We *choose* the way we react to feeling scared, to being bullied, and to every other experience that we have. People have been through a lot worse than us and *still* managed to come out learning and growing from their experiences.

Blaming others for things that are our responsibility makes us feel weak, like a victim, and it has really helped me to take back a sense of control of my life to remind myself that I am completely responsible for my experience of life. This isn't to say that you're responsible for every experience *in* life, for growing up in an abusive home, or for being bullied at school (although a strong case can be made for that too), but you are definitely responsible for how you react to those experiences.

Now for a more comforting truth. Despite the fact that we are completely responsible for our own lives, and we can't blame anyone else for it, we can't blame ourselves either. Blaming yourself for being socially awkward or not achieving as much as you wanted is doing almost exactly the same thing, taking away your sense of control and making you a victim of yourself - you are literally bullying yourself with this.

You don't go and intentionally choose to hang out with anyone that treats you like crap, but you still might now be choosing to give yourself a hard time, telling yourself that you can't do something, that you're flawed. Do your best to have more compassion for yourself, you are doing the best you can with your current level of development.

Negative self talk like that is even more harmful than any bullying or abuse that you may have been subjected to - you can always leave and go and watch a movie to get away from someone else, but how are you ever expecting to get away from yourself when it's you putting yourself down?

You want to do better, and that's a great thing because you're already thinking about it all. You can improve, and you can provide yourself a lot of encouragement to do so. Everyone has heard of positive thinking, and this is what this boils down to, supporting yourself and giving yourself the encouragement to learn and grow.

I personally also struggle with asserting myself and drawing boundaries for other people. This is still something I'm still working on, and I still screw up, like yesterday when I felt bad for letting people try to demand too much from me. So now I have the choice of resenting them and blaming them for not giving me enough time, or just taking the time I need to do it the way I need, acknowledging that the stress that I was putting on myself yesterday is something to learn from. It is *absolutely* my responsibility to take care of myself, and blaming others for putting pressure on me, or blaming myself for not handling that pressure better would be destructive, making me feel weak and stupid.

Give yourself the time and freedom you need to make yourself well, even if it means being selfish. Taking back a little control, working those social skills, ticking off a few tasks or goals, completing the odd assignment, and giving yourself permission to go and watch a movie are just as important as anything else.

Since I've taken the pressure off of myself, I've been able to connect more to people socially. I don't find I need a lot of this personally - I'm an introvert and quite happy with that, but I like having the choice.

It all takes practice, and you owe it to yourself to do whatever works for you. It seems obvious to me that the way that I was behaving and treating myself before *wasn't* working for me. Have a think, but it sounds like you might be feeling the same."
soc_223654,socialskills,reddit_comment,163,"It's a very real thing that some people are just boring. I think people like that are waiting for life to find them.

Sounds like you just need to try more things. Summer is coming up, why don't you apply for work as a summer camp counselor and spend the summer cultivating a sense of community and mentorship for a brief period? If that doesn't sound appealing, pick up a new hobby or start exercising or get a job. If that doesn't sound appealing, do it anyway so you spend your time focusing on your life and the people around you instead of your state of mind. 

Personality is just a collection of emotional reactions to events in our lives that are shaped by the experiences we've had. You have a personality. It's up to you to make it rich by filling it with life.

Happiness is a symptom of taking control of your life and feeling a sense of growth, however small."
soc_1003450,socialskills,reddit_comment,728,"I don’t care about “working on yourself” or whatever. That’s not what makes people like you. Most people don’t give a fuck. If you want some connection, I don’t know. It’s hard to get lol. You’re asking too much. Nobody is walking around connecting with everyone they meet.

The closest you can get is like I said, you just sit there and listen to them. That’s how I started out. I was a social outcast my entire life. Zero friends growing up. Bullied by people until I was 25 years old. How sad is that? I was literally a piece of shit in people’s eyes because nobody likes people like I was. Social outcasts. You should be glad you don’t just get bullied.

So I started out trying to learn social skills. I have extremely bad anxiety, and now that I have therapy it’s confirmed. It’s fucking bad. But I didn’t know. I just thought I was unlucky with my childhood and never learned social skills. But the real problem was always anxiety.

I started off just listening to people. You can do the whole “how are you” blah blah blah. But there’s two kinds of how are you’s. There’s the how are you that you say so you can move along with your day. And then there is the genuine how are you where you really actually care about how people are feeling and you wish to add positivity to their day.

If you can do that, you’ll get it back as well. You might not be connecting through words, but people feel it when it’s genuine.

As far as listening goes, it’s the same. You have to decide really in your mind to say fuck it. It’s OK that people are selfish and only care about themselves. I choose to care about other people too.

And so I try to get that feeling and express it to others. Even if I’m just saying hi how are you I want them to know I care about their well-being.

Again, this also invites the leeches to leach off of you. Which is fine if you’re desperate for some kind of connection. Use the opportunity of the leeching person to learn something about them or about social skills in general. It’s all a game you’re playing and you’re just leveling up.

As far as actual real true and healthy and good connections, I don’t know. I personally feel that it only happens when you find people who have similar passions as you.

Even when I talk to my dad, we talk about the same shit all the time. Those areas we have in common. Is our relationship shallow? I don’t know maybe. But I love my dad, he’s great. But still, we really mostly talk about the same shit every time we talk lol. We both have a similar passion for spiruality. I’m an atheist and he’s spiritual. I’m just trying to investigate it and learn about it because it’s very interesting and enlightening even if I still am an atheist. So we talk about that a lot.

Same goes with any random person. If you have something in common, engage on that shit. That’s how you connect with people I suppose. I mean I’m no expert I was a social outcast my whole life but this is how I see it now.

If you expect people to respond a certain way you’re just going to be depressed forever. Cuz people only care about themselves. That’s just the way it is. You want them to care about you too but why would they? They don’t even know you. Getting to know people and getting close to them is some long complex process that I don’t understand. But it’s no use worrying about connecting with people. It’s not easy. You have to be happy by yourself. You have to love yourself too. Your value isn’t based on how other people feel about you. Most people with tons of friends have tons of fake friends. Most people are swimming in an ocean of fakeness because they are scared nobody cares about them. So they cling to whoever will give them attention. It’s a fucking sad state of affairs.

If you’re in that state, IMO it’s not good. But don’t ask me I don’t know shit lol. That’s just how I feel."

If I want to be lazy all day, I can do that without anyone telling me that I should be doing work around the house.  If I, at the last minute, decide I want to go to a concert or some other event, I can do that without a significant other telling me its not fair that they can't go because its too expensive, doesn't line up with their schedule, etc.  I do as I please and it is a VERY freeing feeling.  Even if I were to meet someone that I fell in love with again, it would be a tough decision as far as giving up the freedom I have to start a relationship with them.

If none of what I said is true for you, there are some decent options that have already been given to you.  If these are good friends, I definitely wouldn't blow them off simply because they are going to ask some questions you'd rather not answer.

I actually just met up with a friend and his girlfriend that I hadn't seen in over a year this past weekend.  He asked me about women and why I was still single.  I simply explained to him the above.  He seemed like he understood and said, ""Well, you seem like you're happy, so who am I to judge?  Just don't rule it out... you never know.""  I told him that I hadn't, but that I was enjoying being single.  Then we went back to talking about video games and his new job.  It wasn't a big deal and I'm sure it won't be for you either."
soc_437588,socialskills,reddit_comment,146,"This is part of the reason i left social media. Being an introvert and seeing the seemingly amazing picture distort your perception of yourself. It's about being honest with yourself. It definitely isn't a bad thing to have a group of friends. It also is not a bad thing to be around family as long as of course, relationships are healthy. Some people isolate themselves and end up becoming unhappy and toxic towards loved ones. Social influence sometimes deters things like that out of fear of judgement. But you feeling as if you should have went could also be a sign to take advantage of the next opportunity to have fun. It's all subjective but unless its to a point when there is severe anxiety or fear around hanging around people where you consistently avoid it, then at that point there would be cause for concern."
soc_120264,socialskills,reddit_comment,339,"Self acceptance I think is more about trusting yourself than anything else. It is in a way simply knowing that you will do the right thing at the right moment without the need to pre-judge your action. So you have to reinforce an attitude of trusting yourself, and doing things before you even have a chance to pre-judge your actions, how do you do that? Well one way is to put yourself in situations where you have the opportunity to make quick decisions and get near instant feedback, and build that trust up in yourself slowly. I think this is why so many people in this subreddit recommend getting hobbies, and while I agree, I think the type of hobby you dedicate yourself to is very important. I think things like playing music with others, team sports(basketball, soccer, football), improv, etc are the way to go because they encourage not only quick decision making but reactive decision making because you are engaging with others in the activity. The ultimate goal is to act before the voice in your head even has a chance to say anything, and when a perfectly lobbed cross is coming at you, you don't have time to think you just kick the ball into the goal. Right now I think your problem is that before you even have a chance to do or say anything in social settings the voice in your head stops you. This should be the other way around where you judge what you say after you say it, so its kind of a mental shift in a way. A lot of this I think has to do with how as children we're constantly told to think before we speak, but thats another topic for another day. Anyway by exposing yourself to these type of hobbies you begin to build a mental model of learning how to trust yourself in certain situations and then you can extrapolate that mental model further to more personal areas of your life. Just my two cents.  "
soc_161176,socialskills,reddit_comment,200,"You're in a male dominated major and have ""male"" hobbies.... you say you're plain looking and have ""great hygiene"". To read between the lines, do you try to be feminine at all? Would you say your style is androgynous or even masculine? Men will usually go for feminine women, even if they're less attractive, just like most women will go for a masculine guy versus an effeminate one. I'm not saying it's right, but it's usually true. Is it possible you're not giving off a very feminine vibe? This is the sort of thing you have to decide on a personal level if you want to change our not, because obviously you don't want to change ""who you are"" to attract random members of the opposite sex, but dressing in feminine clothes that flatter your figure, wearing your hair nicely, and possibly wearing a bit of makeup can be the difference between guys perceiving you as androgynous versus someone they're interested in. Again, this comes down to your personal choice and I'm not saying it's right to change your style to attract people, just suggesting that may be the issue in the real world that isn't always fair and egalitarian.

soc_1226219,socialskills,reddit_comment,283,"Hey OP! Kind of in the same boat as you but slowly started speaking to people who made me feel comfortable enough to be on social media again. 

Here are my thoughts:
It really is up to you if you want to respond to them or not. You may be ready to come back to social media but are you ready to socialize again? Obligating yourself to reply to those messages might exhaust you socially. If you were to message them, a short starting message will do, such as ""hey, i just wanted to let you know im back on social media again. i just finished exams last week (you can choose to omit this if you want). Then you can proceed to read the messages they sent and reply to them if you want.

You don't owe them an apology for going off social media and you absolutely do not need to reconnect to everyone on social media on your return. Don't worry about them being mad, they most likely aren't and if they are then, don't apologize for prioritizing yourself and/or taking a break from social media. 

You can always start small. Start by speaking to your closest friends first or the ones who make you feel comfortable and know won't hold any hard feelings for your being offline. And if your interaction with them does not make you feel like going off social media again, you can choose to continue reconnecting with others.

Idk if its just me but being off social media felt really amazing and helped me learn a lot of new things in the span of 2 months.

Best of luck OP! Don't push yourself too hard!"
soc_1579688,socialskills,reddit_comment,205,"First and foremost, address the anxiety. how? exposure. When you get triggered, you have to learn to get still and sit with the feeling until it dissipates, by sitting with the feeling, I mean, being present with the sensations in your body (tightness in your chest or belly). Second, when it comes to social skills, the more you go out and practice the better you get. Also try not to go alone to social events. Bring someone you're comfortable with and you will be less inhibited. Wear clothes/makeup/anything that makes you feel pretty/handsome. Acknowledge that most people are self-conscious and they're focused on their own shortcomings. They will not see whatever you're worried they will see, they don't care that much. And if you plan to change yourself to fit in, don't. Be brave and advertise yourself for who you are, and thus you will end up with a crowd that ""gets"" you. Question whatever you think is the worst that can happen, you will be surprised to see it's not that bad. Think of the things you don't like about yourself and then try to look for these particular ""defects"" in people you admire and you'll see that it's actually not a problem. =))))"
soc_482833,socialskills,reddit_comment,244,"OK. ive been getting high 0-7 nights a week to go to sleep for the past 3 years and i have to say, you are very mistaken. This is the problem, people have these misconceptions about weed in particular and they keep throwing around these negatives that aren't true. There has been research by sleep psychologists that determined that you only get bad sleep quality if you get high for a while then stop and have withdrawals. Withdrawals are the same thing you get from alcohol and caffeine and those two also apply to poor sleep quality. But it is proven through studies and my own experiences that there is very little to no difference in sleep quality stoned vs sober and the only difference is that you can fall asleep much faster with weed. The other thing, SMOKING weed might be worse because you are SMOKING which isn't harmful but it is bad to an extent and might result in some poor sleep. Vaporizing or eating THC on the other hand, results in better sleep quality than smoking and i have never noticed a difference between going to bed sober and high except for how long it takes me to fall asleep at night. I used to have restless nights for as long as i can remember until i found marijuana. Say what you will, ill stick with what works for me because it might not work for you as everyone is different."

soc_743813,socialskills,reddit_comment,283,"Here's some tips i guess;

1. Yes, women do not like being approached in public. Especially by men because often it's kind of a scary experience. Most women know that most men have the physical strength to overpower them in a fight. 

*however* you can join in situations where you are expected to talk to women. eg. Dating apps. It's a great way to meet women, where they get to choose the location and time and not feel so threatened. Plus, you said that you're quite good at talking online. So you could talk to them for a while online first to warm up, let them know you're autistic so you might be a bit awkward in person, or not. It's all up to you

Making friends with random people in public is basically impossible. I know people have done it but usually people need something to force them to hang out before they become friends. 

I would suggest joining a club for something you enjoy, or a sports team. Even just becoming a regular at a coffee shop can be a way to get to meet new people. 

As for tips on how to socialise, it sucks but for autistic people it usually doesn't come naturally. So, a lot of the time autistic people will go out of their way to find online resources to understand what's seen as awkward and what isn't. 

I'm not diagnosed as autistic, but until I did some research I had no idea that avoiding eye contact was seen as rude.  There's plenty of online resources that explain stuff like this because there are plenty of people who never got the hang of conversations and body language."
soc_272156,socialskills,reddit_comment,525,"the_girls' suggestion is good. 

There are several things you can do. 
You can make plans to do something together. Or, if you decide you don't want to keep in contact you can just say it was great to meet them and then leave. You can give a reason to stay in touch or not. 
After you practice a few times you'll start to get the hang of it. Every conversation is like a song: it has different parts. Based on each phase you will know when is the best time to do what. 

When I met a top producer in Hollywood we found out that we both loved art. I had never been to the Getty Museum and she was telling me how amazing it was. So I said ""We should go sometime!"" The way you say it signals whether you want to date or just hang out as friends. As well as what you spoke about. We traded contact info. We talked for a while after that. Afterwards I said I was going to have a cigarette (you can say you are going to the bathroom or going to get some food, whatever). By the time you get back they will be talking to someone else. You can then talk to someone else. 

Sometimes, I'll just say ""I'll be back"" very nicely and leave. Most times I'll do this if I was talking to a group to make sure they have someone to talk to when I leave. 

If not, I'll bring someone into the conversation or introduce them to someone. 

I usually got their email. Nowadays I'll do texting. Social media you can get later. The reason I like doing the phone number and texting is because they are in your phone. And so many people text nowadays. You can pretty much use anything. I think it's more personal preference. 

It's not whether you leave or not. It's HOW you leave that's important. When you leave make sure you leave on a high emotional level. What I like to do is before I leave the event I make sure to say goodbye to all the people I talked to. This is a chance for me to remind them about our plans (and keep them excited) or to get the contact info of anyone I didn't get before (I use a technique I call ""time dilation"" so I may not get their contact info right away). 

If I met the person at a place like a bookstore or a cafe then I can just say ""It was great meeting you"" (which signals that you need to leave). If I want to stay in touch I'll say ""Let's stay in touch"" or something like that. It depends on what the conversation was about. Which is why I don't like scripts. There is never a perfect script that works for every situation. For me, it better to understand what's going on behind the scenes so that I can identify the phases and why you need to say certain things. Then, when I recognize a similar situation, I know to use something like it. 

Hope this helped. "
soc_323278,socialskills,reddit_comment,224,"&gt;Are these feelings justified or am I experiencing latent escapism or something?

I'm not sure whether you will want to hear this, most people are going to assume I am attacking them for no reason. This can be taken negatively, or as an inwardsinsight.

That voice you are hearing is your Ego. Your Ego won't let you be inadequate. That is one of the functions of our Egos. The Ego rewrites our experiences so we can live with ourselves and not be as fucked us as we really are. Because your outing didn't go the way you would have liked, your Ego rewrites what happened to be ""oh it was a waste of time... those people wouldn't be good friends anyway... I would have had more fun watching paint dry."" Those calls are your Ego trying to protect you from improving yourself. You are not your Ego, it is a tool, don't let it hold you back. What would you have thought if you met a really cute girl and made a girlfriend?

The fact that you are questioning this feeling says that you know there is something holding your back. It is up to you what you do with it. People on this subreddit are practising their ego-stroking skills (stroking someone else's ego to build relationships), but I feel you need something else."
soc_748677,socialskills,reddit_comment,126,"This is an excellent point I complain about all the time. The people on reddit aren't your friends or family. They don't know you from a hole in the wall.

It's easy to suggest oh red flag move on when you have no consequences to deal with from it and zero context.

soc_94200,socialskills,reddit_comment,447,"First thing:  Take all this as positive.  It is great that you are trying to improve yourself and your life.  I give you credit for that and the following is meant to support you.

You appear to be doing everything possible to improve your social skills except for actually working on your social skills.  The line from one of your responses that really sticks with me is about being left alone at a table while everyone was at another table.  Why didn't you pick up your chair, move over to the other table, and sit down and join in?

You seem to have this belief that just showing up is good enough b/c of ""your personality type.""  Bullshit.  Your personality type is the very thing you need to fix.  You can't declare that you are a quiet, reserved person and wonder why everyone thinks you are a quiet, reserved person.

As I see it, you have two options:  Fake it until you become it, or take some risks and expose yourself.

Option 1 requires you to develop a social persona modeled after someone, or a group of people.  I think the pick up community is questionable when it comes to male female interactions, but they do have interesting resources on story telling and being engaging socially.  Check those out.  Create a social persona.  It will allow you to engage without putting yourself in real danger and it will keep your ""personality type"" out of the way.  With time, with increased interaction, you will find that more of the real you comes out until you are actually comfortable being social.

Option 2 requires you to accept and like who you are, and then share that with others.  This is by far the tougher of the two options.  It means being able to talk to someone new about what you love and being able to accept if they think you are odd b/c of it.  It is loving yourself enough that if a room full of people tell you they don't like you, you go home and wonder what was wrong with that room full of people, not what was wrong with you.  You learn to do this, to be genuine and confident, and you will draw others to you like moths to a flame.

You have to decide what you really want, what your goals are, and what you are willing to do to get there.  You aren't getting the results you want b/c what you are doing isn't working.  Good on you for recognizing that and asking for help.  Now, can you follow the advice others have given and face the discomfort required for growth?

Good luck.

soc_1656081,socialskills,reddit_comment,580,"Same! I also have social anxiety and I've felt thoughtless this year too. It's sucks and more considering I'm starting at a new school. I asked the same thing and a kind soul told me this (copy pasted) Maybe this helps because i find it complete.

i used to have this same problem, my mind would just go quiet around people. i don't know if you'll be able to do this, but this is what helped me: 
- weed: i don't know if you smoke, ive found that the stoner population is increasing. if you do, take a break. weed really hurt my social anxiety and made my mind go even more blank than it usually would.
- physical reminders: make a list of the things you love, the things that make you you. when you're alone, sit and think, what are the things i'm passionate about or the little things i love. like: i love baking cookies, i love the taste of raspberry jam, i love indie music, etc. it can be big or small, just anything that comes to mind that you think defines you as the person you are. when in conversation you can think back to this list and reconnect to the person you are outside of your social anxiety. 
- questions: when in doubt, ask questions about the other person! it can be beyond small talk. you said it goes quiet after the ""how are you"", so let's say you say how are you and they say good. you can say, what have you been up to? they say work you say, what have you been doing at work? anything new? and so on and so forth. usually the person will reciprocate and ask questions back. if they don't, assure yourself that you're trying to keep the conversation afloat and they're not reciprocating. it's not your fault. 
- connections: when they say something, try to connect it to your own life. ""things have been good at work"", ""yeah me too, i just got a promotion and i love it!"" if you feel bad connecting things to your life out of fear you're making the conversation about you, remind yourself that people do it all the time and that's how conversations go. also, if you have anxiety about how other people feel remind yourself that they can say something about it! they're a big person and if they're upset then they can tell you, it's not up to you to be a people pleaser.
- affirmations: finally, affirmations. after going through all these steps, if the conversation is still silent, remind yourself it's probably not your fault. you're okay and you are as yourself as you can be. you'll find the right person and this person just isn't that! when you ground yourself in the reality (that this conversation is going as well as it can be, and you've put in all the effort you can) you take the focus off yourself and onto the situation. you are not to blame. you are a well rounded and interesting person with or without the silence that this conversation has created. 

i suffer really hard from social anxiety. i know how you feel. these are the strategies that have helped me. other things that have helped me have been studying how other people hold conversations in movies and tv shows, youtube videos etc. if you need anymore help or someone to talk to, feel free to dm me!"

Regarding the universities, it really depends on your field. I have an economics background and made my bachelor at a Fachhochschule (University of Applied Sciences) which is less research and more practical based, whereas my traditional university is more scientific research based. I personal prefer my bachelor university, now after have studied at another. But it really depends on the field.

Are you into biology/ technical stuff / IT or mathematics -&gt; ETH in Zurich is the most recognised Site

For economics Universität St. Gallen (HSG) is highly respected.

What are you planning to study?

Edit: you said you didn’t want to go to a prestigious school necessarily. Then it really doesn’t matter where you are going. Bigger universities have more options for international students but it really depends on the study course (I am in a master course with &gt;50% internationals therefore more activities but other courses offer less)"
soc_1070874,socialskills,reddit_comment,336,"**TL;DR** Let people come to their own conclusions.

I come from a teaching background, which definitely colors every conversation I have. But I will say that in both my work and personal life, I've been told that I'm enjoyable to talk to and a good communicator. But ya know, I'm not a psychologist. Take this with a grain of salt.

Most people already know the solutions to their problems; all they want is to express their frustration that the problem exists in the first place. You'll find that when people want advice, they'll ask you directly, ""What do you think I should do?""

When they aren't saying that, acknowledge their emotion, and ask to elaborate. If you don't know their emotion, guess. If you're wrong, people will correct you, no biggie.

**Example conversation:**

Coworker: ""Andy is so lazy, this is the 4th time she's been late to a customer call. She makes the company look bad.""

Me: ""Ugh, how frustrating.""

""I'm not frustrated, I'm just annoyed.""

""I get that. I'd be annoyed too. Did she say why she was late?""

""She just said she's swamped and lost track of time.""

""Sounds rough. Is her workload really that high?""

""Well, to be fair....""

At this point, my coworker got to express her annoyance, and cooled down. She ended up initiating the conversation about how to solve Andy's tardiness herself.

If she had said, ""No,"" I'd ask her some questions about Andy's previous work habits. I do this mostly out of nosiness, but I find that people really enjoy conversing with me and this is what I do. I ask questions about people's stories. I ask to elaborate. 

People generally come up with their own solutions during the conversation. For instance, eventually my coworker said, ""I should schedule a meeting with Andy and talk about sharing some of our responsibilities so she's not as stressed."" If I had started the conversation with ""You should work with Andy"" that would be insensitive to my coworker's feelings...if that makes sense."
soc_410259,socialskills,reddit_comment,227,"&gt; I just can't think of a starting topic to talk with someone I haven't met yet cause it's awkward and I'm scared of their reaction if they think I'm weird or trying to manipulate them. 

Thanks for spelling it out.  


Sounds like you can hold a conversation just fine, but need help starting them.  


There are two things I'd like you specifically to focus on when trying to improve this for yourself: Words and Nerves.

Even if it feels really obvious when you're nervous, it's actually very hard to tell just by looking at somebody. You're the only one who knows you're nervous. Having a few steady breaths before the conversation starts will help calm your nerves. Also, the wonderful thing about confidence is that if you fake it for long enough, you get it for real.

When introducing yourself, an easy rule to remember is to try to end on an *open-ended question*. Ideally, it's a question that will segue nicely into the rest of the conversation. ""Hey there, I'm Tristala, what book is that?"", ""Hiya! My name is Tristala, nice to meet you. I love your sense of fashion! Where'd you get that top?"", ""Hey! Good morning! Was that Markiplier? No? I'm Tristala by the way. What were you watching?""  


Does that help? Feel free to ask me follow up questions if you want."
soc_134622,socialskills,reddit_comment,221,"I am just going to stop you there and not let you put ""being a good friend"" as something you bring to the table. Being good to not only your friends but other people should be done anyways. If you put too much work into being the best friend possible you might leave yourself out of that. Thats what I did at least. 

Now I don't know you, so I can't tell you what you bring to the table, but I can tell you that you bring things to the table by working on yourself as a person. Makes sense right? The better you are at things, the more you have to bring. 

So here is what I think you should do. Find a hobby you love, something that can be done socially preferably. Now join a group and do it. Get better at it. Invest the time in yourself. Use the people around you to help push yourself further and help them grow as well. 

By doing this you will meet new people, and hopefully some really great long-term friends with similar interests. You will also feel like you have something to offer because you will have a skill that you continue to develop. Obviously there is much more to it than that but you have to start somewhere right?

soc_1595125,socialskills,reddit_comment,214,"You made an overture. You said, ""Hey, we hang out a lot. Let's go back and forth paying for things so we can both have a great time and treat each other occasionally"". Your friend, however, is telling you that he doesn't want to do that. He's coming back saying, ""Look, I just want to split everything down the middle"". Neither is right or wrong, it's just a different approach to how things feel fair. You have a weird blessing in disguise here because you now know how it's going to be. You pay for your food, drinks, and activities. He pays for his. 

Maybe he's not a generous person. Maybe he's afraid he can't afford to go out with you if he has to cover the whole thing every other time and it hits him between paychecks. Maybe it just makes him uncomfortable to not split things and he really just prefers to go dutch every time. It's really fine. But now you know if you treat him, you can't expect him to return the favor and you can plan your behavior accordingly. 

You'll have other friends in your life who want to go back and forth covering the tab, and that'll be great when it happens. But this friend isn't that guy."
soc_1188789,socialskills,reddit_comment,372,"Just my opinion here so take it with a grain of salt. It is oftentimes ""easy"" to be part of a group and just coast on that and assume ""hey these are all my friends."" But that really isn't true unless you make the effort to spend one-on-one time with these people individually. Whether that be a phone call, a gaming session together, going to work out, doing an errand, just hanging out. You have to make the effort for the one-on-ones.

I'm guessing you've never done that with this guy. Maybe you've never done it with most of them. Maybe only one or two are real friends. So that's what you need to change. Think about doing that on a weekly basis. Pick one person in the friend group and try to do something with just that person.

Now punishing this guy by not attending his party, or punishing yourself by leaving chats or not having social fun, I think that's counterproductive. Yes it shows you're upset, maybe even angry, but WHY? Because you're not being fully appreciated as a friend. Yes, of course I get that. But you have to make the effort to ESTABLISH that friendship. Not just assume it because you're part of a group.

Secondary to that it sounds like you may not be clicking on all cylinders with all people of this group. It's possible you let them do most of the work with talking or contributing to group vibe. You can change that by bringing some positive social energy. So, bring a big smile, an energetic greeting, a PLAYFUL FRAME OF MIND. (If you think this will be difficult to do with your current group, then I suggest practicing in low risk situations like with store cashiers, gym attendants, people who work at your school, coffee servers etc.) People enjoy those who can bring a fun, playful frame of mind and a bit of SOCIAL ENERGY with them.

That's what I'd work on. Start working on it today and bring that attitude TO THE PARTY. Make friends there and interact with your group in a FUN way there. And tell this guy how much you enjoyed it and how awesome his parties are.

Good luck!"

Secondly, whatever your friends' experiences and impressions are, that's not a guide to men. Everyone is different and you should never feel like you have to live up to whatever standards society gets up to these days. Your boundaries are your own, not what people expect them to be. :)

I weep slightly at the thought that anyone would have to send nudes to 'have a chance' with someone. That's just bullshit. There are no rules. You need someone you click and connect with, and whoever that turns out to be will respect your boundaries. First it's this, what's next?

soc_895082,socialskills,reddit_comment,114,"Are there any recurring specific thoughts or feelings that come up during your interactions with your friends that cause you to want to avoid them? I used to get very anxious about embarrassing myself around friends and getting mocked or belittled by them for it, and that would cause me to run out of energy around them. Once I went to college and found some better friends, I found that it was much easier to spend a lot of time with them. 

I don’t know if you lose energy around your friends for the same reason I did, but there might be some other unconscious feeling that results in that. Just my two cents."
soc_131130,socialskills,reddit_comment,165,"Personally, I wouldn't start a conversation with these because I wouldn't want someone to start a conversation with me using any of these examples. 

If you are introducing yourself to someone you haven't met, casual questions are a much better bet in terms of actually engaging with someone. After a few moments of *casual* conversation, you can both sort of gauge the interest in/of each other - maybe you want to continue talking to them (in which case, the examples above *would* come in handy), and maybe you don't (Well it's been great meeting you! I'm gonna go do that thing...)

If you just walk up to someone and open with these deep questions, it's likely they don't really want to answer (because they're at a party with people they know they like, and one of the people who they don't know just asked them a soul-searching question) or will just answer quickly and move along because that's a pretty awkward situation.

Just my opinion. "
soc_1392199,socialskills,reddit_comment,602,"I'm going to help you out OP, I know what's going on because EVERY SINGLE GUY makes this mistake on dating apps.

I personally looked at your pics OP.

-Your pics are incredibly posed, not candid AND you look awkward. They don't look natural. I'm not saying you are awkward, but your photos scream ""I am lonely and awkward"".
Remedy this by taking new pics with natural lighting and more natural facial expressions. Don't smile at the camera unless you are posing for an intentionally silly pic.
You need VARIETY in your pics. Here's the formula:

-You need 2 pics where you look hot. That'll be your biggest challenge, as appearing hot in photos is incredibly difficult even with good looks.  
-You need 1 pic of your blank face with no expressions looking straight at the camera (use good natural lighting from a window, don't let the sun shine directly on you. Close the blinds a little so the light is indirect.)
-You need 1 silly pic. Based on your looks, I can say your face doesn't scream 'ultra-masculine', which is completely fine as not all guys have that look. Because of this, you may want to use just 1 silly pic. Do something fun or pose with a silly object. I have a very funny/attractive pic of myself where I'm holding a banana like a telephone.

-You need 1 pic where you're outside, preferably doing an activity. I see you have hiking gear, keep taking pics like that until you get a really solid pic that looks completely candid (not posed). Your face should be visible.

-And finally, you need 1 pic that is completely up to you. It's good if It's unique/interesting or cool. Again, outside is best. This pic can also be hard to come up with.
-You need all 6 pics for a (good) shot at dating apps.
5 pic minimum, but definitely shoot for 6.

-DON'T use the pic you have where you're looking sideways, it emphasizes and elongates your nose. Plus, no one takes pics like that for dating. Emphasize your strengths in pics, minimize your weaknesses. It's up to you to determine your best/worst physical traits

-Think natural facial expressions. Take 1000+ pics.
I took thousands of photos with a very expensive camera, months of editing and coming up with clever ideas....I ended up keeping only 6 of them.....it really is THAT hard to make awesome pics.

-Hit the gym. In just 3 months of effort you can make enough difference that women will notice you. You can start slow. I myself own a bunch of dumbbells/weights so I don't physically have to go to a gym. More privacy but expensive.
Look up Athlean-X on youtube, he's the guy who teaches NFL football players how to workout. I followed his advice and now I look like a greek statue. 

-Invest in beauty products. Skin care stuff. Research moisturizers, antioxidant serums and AHA's/ BHA's (facial acids). These products legitimately do work, after using them for 3 days I don't even recognize myself in the mirror. Pure, flawless complexion.
Your face is arguably the most important part of dating....or attraction....it's what people look at.
I could justify dating someone with a bad body if they had a cute face.

-And in my opinion, you may want to consider a shorter hairstyle? That's a completely personal decision, but it doesn't make you look tidy.

-If you want to know more, I know the perfect resource to direct you to. It may completely change your dating life. (Not a scam, just totally free solid advice from very successful men)."
soc_759920,socialskills,reddit_comment,310,"&gt;That's a strange thing, yes. But sociopaths and schizoids for example are perfectly content with their life affecting illness, too.

A lot of people get Personality Disorders wrong. 

Firstly, no person is a pure sociopath, borderline or schizoid. Think of it like an RPG game. They are personality traits. It's a spectrum. Influenced by your genetics, childhood and other environmental factors. 

They also change on a case by case basis. Some actions demand a higher level of narcissism, sociopathy and etc. You have to have some level of sociopathy if you are a boss of a large company and have to constantly fire people or a surgeon who has to amputate a leg. You have to crank up your narcissism if you are going to a job interview. These traits aren't inherently good or bad.

Everyone is different and scale higher in some traits while scoring lower in other traits. Basically most people can get diagnosed for a personality disorder if a psychiatrist tested them, especially if they are slightly less balanced and one of their trait is stronger. Look at your thanksgiving dinner gathering and how wildly different people are. 

When should a person go to a psychiatrist? Either when the person feels his issues are affecting his life satisfaction negatively, other people feel the person poses harm to themselves or others.

If a person wants to run off to the wilderness and live alone for their rest of life and they are happy, let them be. Sure, some people would find the person eccentric. Maybe their parents would be disappointed and think he is mentally deranged for not fitting in and wanting to become a manager like their dad. But as long as the person isn't delusional, psychotic, they don't pose any harm to themselves or others and they are happy, what should you rehabilitate? There's no problem."
soc_1637241,socialskills,reddit_comment,126,"I don't get too upset about it. It depends on the person, how well I know them and what the conversation is about. Did they message first or did I? Are they generally a busy person? Is it a conversation where a longer than usual reply is warranted and they might not be available to give a proper one in the moment?

And about the popular rebuttal that it only takes a second or two to reply: that's not true. A message can and often leads into an entire conversation and sometimes when I reply late, it's because I know that I don't have the time or mental energy to do that. My friends understand this. If you need an immediate answer on something then call."
soc_562256,socialskills,reddit_comment,296,"I learned through a lot of depression and loneliness that you don't need a relationship to make you happy because chances are it won't be what makes you happy. There are plenty of people with clinical depression and Major Depressive Disorder who are mothers, fathers, boyfriends, wives, etc. They still take their life even though they have what you think and what I used to think would make us feel whole.

The truth is you have to be comfortable in your own skin without any of those things first before you can have them. You gotta be okay with spending plenty of nights alone or else you might go into a relationship clingy or not trusting your partner when they go a day without texting you back. It's not a good state of mind to be in when you're dating someone.

We all feel lonely from time to time, some people feel that way more often than others, but there are also times when we feel like we want to be alone. I learned not too long ago that the whole club scene and major parties filled with a bunch of people I don't know isn't what I want. I just wanna chill with the very few friends I have, drink a couple beers, smoke a joint or two, play some pool, and listen to some records. That doesn't make me weird or antisocial, it just means I value different things than a lot of other people my age.

When you carry yourself as someone who doesn't care whether you walk alone or with 50 people trying to talk to you, that's when you'll attract people to you, and then it's up to you to decide weed through those people and determine who's really your friend."

It is definitely rude to bring up someone's speaking habits and possible social anxieties to them without first knowing whether or not it's something they want to have a talk about, but without context no one can know how this person meant it. Were they talking about how much they love dark and mysterious types and then told you? Or were they telling you about how much they hate having to lead a conversation when the person they're talking to doesn't even try, and then told you? What I'm saying is it depends on context how they meant it, and it depends on your judgment how you take it, and if it is rude, whether or not you want to bring it to their attention by being rude back."

In reality, you do have some social skills, and often you're the only one who thinks you look like a complete dumbass in conversations. Usually people don't think much about you at all, and if they notice you're awkward, they more often have sympathy than disgust.

The delusion that you're always socially useless goes together with the delusion that everyone else always knows what to do. In reality, almost everyone has been through awfully awkward times, and maybe a third of the people you meet are as scared as you, under their polished facade.

Getting friends through drinking or smoking weed is a questionable strategy, but... if your life is so completely worthless, why not try have a drink with people now and then. What have you got to lose?"
soc_1147548,socialskills,reddit_comment,178,"TL;DR

Support in moderation is the key. Don't lay it on thick but don't forget it happened either. Follow the personality of the person who's hurting. If they're needy then be extra helpful. If they're independent then let them know you're there and leave it in the back of your head. 


It depends on the person. My friends dad died of covid about 2 months ago. He and I have a pretty dark sense of humor so I'd would go easy on it for a while with him. If they aren't needy then Let them know you're there for them and then leave it at that. Ask once or twice a week how they're doing and how family is but don't force the conversation to be longer than it has to be. If they are particularly more needy then ask if there's anything you can do to help every once in a while. I would even suggest helping with a common task that they do regularly just to show you're they're if they need you.

I have people from middle school and high school on my Snapchat and Facebook and every once in a while I see them or they see me doing something cool/interesting and I/they reached out and we tend to catch up and sometimes meet up to hang out. 

We are not as friends like we used to be, but we definitely have a good connection and a past and is fun to talk about it.

This summer I recently started going skydive and 2 hs and 1 ms friends reached to me and they ended up joining me in other jumps.

My point is you might not be friends with them anymore nor talk to them right now but you never know in the future. You might not care and that's totally fine this is just my opinion."
soc_336306,socialskills,reddit_comment,473,"* A friend is someone whom you spend leisure time with, someone you talk regularly to (the frequency varies greatly for what regular means), and someone you share emotional intimacy with (the level of emotional intimacy varies greatly).


* A friend is a primarily a source of companionship. They provide (limited) emotional support to you, and you provide (limited) emotional support to them. It is normal that a limited amount of help in practical matters will be exchanged (they help you move, you drop them off at the airport, things of that nature).


* A significant other is someone you spend a lot of time with, someone you talk regularly to (the frequency is usually daily), someone you share emotional intimacy with (the level of emotional intimacy is high), and someone you share sexual intimacy with (what types of sexual activity, and the frequency of sexual activity, can vary). 


* A significant other is a source of greater companionship, greater support, and greater help than a friend. Additionally, a significant other includes an explicit commitment to each other that friendship does not. 


* In very general terms, healthy relationships do not involve either party causing pain (primarily meaning emotional, but also including physical) to the other party frequently or deliberately. It is possible for in a healthy relationship to accidentally cause pain to someone once in a while. 


* Because cuddling, hand holding, and other expressions of romantic intimacy involve a level of vulnerability. To be intimate with someone means that you are making yourself vulnerable to being hurt by them (again, primarily emotionally but this could also mean physically). Therefore, there is a vetting process. You get to know someone so that you can assess whether or not you are at risk of being hurt by them if you chose to become intimate with them. You may find people willing to do these things with you even though you  do not know them, and they do not know you. That means those people are willing to accept a larger than normal risk of emotional harm. That's neither bad nor good; that's simply their personal preference.


* Social rejection can be a learning process. If you understand why you were rejected, you may choose to change those things and gain acceptance with another person or group. I personally found this to be the best way to cope with social rejection; I now find that I have a fulfilling social life. Other people do not want to change themselves, in which case the best way to cope may be to be more selective about who you seek out to be friends - see my above point about the vetting process. Just as people move slowly with romantic partners to avoid rejection or being hurt, it may be best to move slowly with potential friends.
"
soc_1487732,socialskills,reddit_comment,288,"Well, it sounds like you are in a similar situation as I was about 10 years ago.

It took therapy, then medication, then a lot more therapy to get better at both being comfortable with what I want, and actually being able to identify what I want. I don't typically enjoy large parties, but I love small gatherings with friends. It's personal preference and it's okay to be comfortable with that if you want to.

There are likely some deeper feelings at play that only you can know. As examples, for some it's a fear of rejection, or being found out as 'not being good enough' to hang out; for me it was believing that my own presence was detrimental to a social setting, and everyone was better off without me. Once you identify what deeper feeling is holding you back, it takes some concerted effort to counter that feeling whenever it shows it's ugly face. With practice, it should become easier until that feeling no longer has the power to make you react. It may not completely go away, and could make the symptoms of anxiety appear from time to time, but it can get better.

Addressing the deeper feeling can also have tremendous impact in other areas of your life too. I discovered my self-worth and value I bring to interactions. I'm now more aware of my personal perspective on things. I've strengthened my moral code and friendships. 

Step one might be to address the negative self-talk. You're gonna have to learn to forgive yourself for symptoms of a medical condition because anxiety is just that, a symptom of your fight or flight response. It's not your fault that it's getting triggered at times that sucks."
soc_555785,socialskills,reddit_comment,297,"Hi OP! This is just my two cents as a fellow shy college student. The good news is you have a lot of time ahead of you in college, so try to spend it enjoying yourself and meeting other people! 

Shyness: Realize that the other students are in the same boat as you. Are you a freshman in the dorms? Say hello to people in passing on your floors, take advantage of the open study spaces, and go to events! Even if you don't feel comfortable talking it's fine - time is your friend here. If you do end up talking with someone, ask them if you can add them on FB or something. It's not weird at all in college to ask that after meeting someone once, and it shows that you would want to talk to them again. 

Invitations to things will come naturally as you meet more people. I don't think shyness is common but if you think therapy is helpful to you, go for it! It's great that you're making the first steps towards change. And finally, when you do hang out with other people, figure out what you want to do. Are you most comfortable hanging out in your own space, like your dorms/apartment? Or would you rather hang out outside, grabbing food or maybe walking around together? 

P.S I'm a girl and I am equally nervous when talking with guys. Just do what you're comfortable with and build up a couple of close friends as a foundation, and build from there. OP, you've got this! Don't be afraid and don't feel like you have to make other people like you. You'll eventually find people who you enjoy talking to more than others, and be sure to keep in contact with them!"

Just let this on loop forever]. Hope you doing well"", If they try to set a date for anything id claim i cannot go or Just never reply the group chat again.

They're both basic human desires, nothing wrong with them.  Unfortunately, they can clash, as you're finding.  You can bridge the two either by sticking to being accepted only by people who share/like your dress sense (they do exist, just look somewhere other than clubs), or by occasionally wearing unpreferred clothes in order to be more widely accepted (doesn't mean you can never wear what you like again or even have to change that much, just more in line with those around you).

Not social media in regards to posting photos and updates about your life, but the texting platforms that social media provides (eg. Facebook Messenger). I use social media purely as a text messaging platform so there's less stress about the fake validation and stress over likes, and it's much more convenient to use rather than texting as people tend to be on social media more often, and therefore reply back more often.

 I've found that social media texting is a great way to turn acquaintances who you casually exchanged social media profiles with in class, into friends by starting off with asking about homework and then chatting more. 

This might be my personal opinion but people might feel more comfortable and be more receptive if you're contacting them on the platform that they use the most, and that could be social media.

It's all down to personal choice and wether you feel comfortable using social media though. It's just another available path to make friends, there are many many other ways that don't need social media!"

soc_1507442,socialskills,reddit_comment,471,"Would you rather have nice friends, or would you rather have kind friends?

I'm going to give a few examples I have personally experienced/observed to see if you notice anything in yourself. Awareness is the major step to solving a problem. Feel free to add your thoughts or experiences. 

Fake friendships are nice to you because 
""fake nice"" is forced politeness - manners that people  have adopted to make communication easier and more pleasant. 
Very often, being nice is a defense mechanism. Nonconfrontational people prefer ""nice communication"" to avoid conflicts. 

Kindness is a connection. No one can fake that. It is kind sometimes to say things as they are, say it out of love, even if it makes people angry. The most ""fake kind"" people I've seen are those who watch their friends go down and won't say anything unpleasant because of the risk of losing that relationship.
For example, a friend is gaining weight by eating too much junk food, and no one says anything because what if it comes across as body shaming? Or let's say a friend drinks too much and does terrible things, wouldn't you step in?


Another thing that stands out is how desperate you want these relationships to work for you to the point that you are willing to pay for tickets without owning your buying power.
Sorry to break to you, but the one who pays, also orders the music. Giving away money irresponsibly caused your friends to lose respect for you; that's why they get away with not inviting you. Have you not said anything?


Please get over of that feeling that you are lucky to have anything. Look where that feeling has led you.
Get over being overly grateful for the opportunities. 
When you are good at something, when you have what to give , you know it. Own it and be ready to walk.
It is not your job to go above and beyond to prove your worth; it is your friend's job to see the best in you and remind  you about when you really need it. 


Turning off desperation is not the easiest thing to do when you  have what to lose. 
That's why it's better to form relationships with kind people.
Look for a coach or a good mentor! Good-hearted people typically give you a fire extinguisher and a flame resistant jumpsuit first before setting your desperation on fire, often risking the relationship itself. What you do with the given tools is up to you from there.

One of the things I've seen over and over is that those people  who are connected can have superheated arguments and then laugh about what all they said later over a glass of beer.
That never happens with fake relationships! They prefer to block you in the blink of an eye)))"
soc_224760,socialskills,reddit_comment,178,"28 y/o male speaking,

Yes, I think that's a great goal! Cursing is a lot like drinking and smoking in the sense of its social aspects. People who curse want those that they are with to curse also and vice-versa. This behavior has a larger influence on who you have relationships with than you may realize.

In fact, if you go from cursing a lot to none at all, you should probably brace yourself for the changes that will have on you socially. Your old relationships may suffer, but at the same time you may find different types of people warming up to you.

I think the fact that you are going to college soon makes this a great opportunity to reinvent yourself and start meeting better, higher caliber people. If there's one thing I have learned in the last 10 years, it is how massively important choosing the right friends is. And learning how to speak--with class, manners and intelligence--is one of the greatest steps you can make toward attracting the best people to you.

Good luck!"
soc_306107,socialskills,reddit_comment,620,"Ok dude. I think you genuinely need some social advice and you're not getting anything worthwhile in this thread.

First things first. Girls are children. Unless you're a little boy then you're not trying to attract ""girls"". You mean women.

Second. No. Women aren't attracted to assholes. We're not stupid. We know when someone is a jerk. Either you've seen one woman you're attracted to end up with an asshole for one reason or another and now you're applying that to all women. Or you assume that the men who get the women are all assholes because sour grapes. Either way, it's just flat incorrect so get that ""women are only attracted to assholes"" mentality right out of your head. It's bullshit.

What ARE women attracted to? The answer is the same as ""what are men attracted to?"" And that is ""It depends on the person.""

In general, most people want to be with someone attractive but different people have different tastes. And an attractive personality can often make up for an average or unattractive body.

How can you make yourself more appealing to women? There are lots of little things you can do to improve yourself. 

• **Basic self-care.** Shower and brush teeth, use deodorant, comb hair. These are all daily. A nice cologne is usually a better bet than body spray. Don't overdo it. You don't need to smell it yourself for it to be there.

• **Physical Appearance.** Some things are within your control, some things aren't. Get a nice haircut and keep it maintained. Shave daily or keep your facial hair groomed nicely. If your skin gives you trouble it's ok for men to have a skincare routine! Check out /r/skincareaddiction and /r/asianbeauty for skincare advice. Shit works. 

If you aren't happy with your body then diet and exercise also work. You don't have to be a body builder to be attractive. Just take basic care of yourself. Believe it or not, chubby or skinny aren't usually deal-breakers. But unhealthy can knock you down a couple notches on the attractive scale.

• **Clothes.** You don't have to spend a fortune on clothes to look presentable. Just make sure you know what to wear in the right situation and make sure you buy clothes to fit your body correctly. /r/malefashionadvice and /r/streetwear are good starting points.

• **Personality.** This is the biggest one for me personally. I'm not as worried about appearance as I am about ""Can I stand to be around this person long-term?"" Looks fade but personality lasts. Forget all that ""alpha"" bullshit you'll get from seduction techniques. (And for the love of all that is holy, DO NOT NEG!) You don't have to be an ass to be confident. It's great to be nice. It's not great to be a ""nice guy"". Be good to people (men and women) because it's the right thing to do, not to try and earn brownie points from women. Just do your best to learn to be comfortable in your own skin. In that same vein, you don't have to let people take advantage of you either. You can be a good person and still say ""no"" to people who try to take advantage of you. Be kind. Be responsible. Remember that women are human beings, not trophies to be won. 

• **Finally-** It's certainly ok to shoot above your league but don't get pissy if you don't get a supermodel. I'm sure you aren't looking to date a woman far less attractive than you are. Same goes for ladies. Men or women, we're all just looking for the best we can get. So we all have to set realistic goals. Nobody is ""owed"" a super attractive partner."

You live your own life, so it's up to you to decide if this type of behavior is something you will be happy with.  It almost sounds as if you have a superiority complex where you might think everybody is wasting your time or that every is just saying stupid bullshit all the time.. I don't blame you if that's so, I am the same exact way.  If you're happy, then there is no issue.  If you're not, my advice to you is to pick just one single day, one day is all I ask of you, and intentionally TRY to care.  TRY to listen and offer them advice based on what you would do.  When you give advice, have a **little** regard to who they are and what they would be comfortable doing, but just give your side of the equation.  Maybe you're scared to care, but you know what?  We'll all be dead in 100 years.  Pick your paths, walk your line, choose your own adventure!"
soc_1701287,socialskills,reddit_comment,483,"Hey! I'm a med student in year 2 without a social life. I've noticed the same thing at my medschool too.

Idk if it's a medschool thing but everyone in my school is extremely tribalistic and insecure. 

Literally, when I first joined medschool, a few students asked me how I fared in the exams, and when I told them I did well in biochem, they legit never spoke to me again -\_- . 

Another instance was in med 2 where we started using sketchy for micro, and this kid wanted some help with micro, so I told him to watch one vid a day and use flash cards. Next thing I know is that the entire class thinks I have photographic memory. 

As far as the tribalism goes, I feel like every group in medschool is essentially a group-venting session, and that basically helps them stay as a group. Like I'm not even kidding, they're either bitching about other medstudents or just whining about how hard medschool is. 

If you didn't get invited to the group lunch session, it's probably because you aren't very close to them. Remember, medstudents are super insecure. 

Also, I've realized that medstudents take ages to open up to you. I had this group of friends in year 1 and it took me an entire year to get them to open up to me. Guess what, they ignored me all through the summer break (3 months) and then had the audacity to reply to me a week before year 2 started, with a ""Sorry I was super busy throughout summer"". 

Never mention that you're in a room and you're okay if anyone wants to go over some stuff. In the medschool world, this sounds like  I'm smarter than you and I can teach you. 

Idk if this applies to all the medstudents, but most of the students I've seen tend to conform to these traits (Insecurity and Tribalism). 

Oh yeah.... Also, I had this other friend group who literally had a study group but, I was never once invited. They even used to plan their study sessions right in front of me. Needless to say our friendship is in a super awkward spot and really strained too. 

In my defense, I was super nice to them, like supportive and helpful, legit never belittled them. 

Welp, I hope this helps. I feel like I went off on a tangent at some points and ended up using this as a venting session because of my non-existent social life. Sorry about that. 

I think you need to find some people who are actually self-motivated and confident about their capabilities. There is this group of 24-26 year olds in my class, who are like super motivated and helpful, and not insecure or tribalistic. 

They were also really inclusive too, felt nice for a change from the toxic behavior other people had to offer."

I personally believe that there's a balance everyone should draw between maintaining one's own sense of individuality while keeping an open mind - however, not so open that we become naive/gullible and not so closed that we're completely set in our ways (especially if they're in dire need of update).

soc_1809792,socialskills,reddit_comment,140,"I think it’s natural for people to look for others weaknesses but not consciously. Most people don’t walk around trying to other weak points, it’s more of a defensive mechanism or just a general way of reading people. Finding out those weaknesses isn’t a crime, exploiting them however is where it gets morally tricky. It’s also a spectrum, we notice when someone isn’t good at a particular thing, wether u deem that as a weakness might be different from what they thing their own weakness is. I think ur asking a difficult question cuz it mostly depends on your goals. You can’t possibly try and hide your weaknesses because you’ll end up adapting to a million different kinds of “fronts” u show to people and end up a weaker person who is more unsure of themselves if that makes sense."
soc_378806,socialskills,reddit_comment,210,"It sounds like an issue of self-filtering. Don't try and swing for the fences with something funny or witty. Often this will put up a quality filter where you cut out everything because nothing is good enough. 

Getting used to saying whatever comes to mind is a good first step. Then give yourself permission to try and amuse yourself, no point trying to amuse the ""other"" who is ever judgemental and unmatchable standards. 

Check out some improv (classes/books/YouTube), a big part of improv is this idea of saying ""Yes and..."". Fully accept what the person said and roll with it. You shouldn't be trying to say something funny, but just keep the scene moving, things can naturally become funny. ""Yeah (yes and...), I'll catch up to you in a few stops"", ""Yeah, I got you."". Dialog is a two way street, don't put all the pressure on yourself. All you have to do it give enough material for the other person to work off of. 

Don't shy away from awkwardness, next time sit in it, be fully absorbed by it. It will build and build, but will fade and you will be fine. Become ok with the awkwardness, try to own it. Let it be an opportunity to get stronger.

If you go through life claiming everyone who would like to resolve a conflict one-on-one is entitled, you’re going to live your entire life believing everyone around you is entitled. Asking someone for an explanation of something that has personally affected them does not constitute entitlement. That’s how adults resolve conflict."
soc_867138,socialskills,reddit_comment,141,I think wanting to  leave this category will mean not wanting to be that most important friend to others. You should be yourself and if people really treasure you they will. Oftentimes when people want something really bad they get stiff in general. Most people will notice that and never open up to you completely because they feel something is off. It is pretty hard to not overthink especially if you have problems seeing your own worth. However even if you were to make best friends that happiness would be restricted to them meaning if anything was to happen to that friendship you will be devastated. It is better to be happy on your own and see other people as a beautiful bonus which is not necessary. Doesn't mean you can't hold them close but you shouldn't be dependent of them.
soc_396804,socialskills,reddit_comment,169,"Your **tone of voice** communicates your emotional state. The voice can tell many secrets about a person. The voice can tell us about the size, state of health and mood of a person. Notice the nuances in emotion when you are angry vs calm. Think about it, if you are at a party, smiling and talking with your friends. Your tone of voice is likely to be friendly. Now, if you are exhausted and someone walk up to you. Imagine the difference in your tone of voice in the second example. Your tone of voice is likely to be lower. Adjusting your tone when you speak is vital to keep the attention of your listener. Use the variety of tone to express your emotions. Most importantly, be sure you are congruent with what you are saying.

You ever heard of the five love languages?

Physical Touch, Quality Time, Gift Giving, Words of Affirmation, and Acts of Service?

If the person you are trying to flirt with is one you see regularly, try each one on them. 

For example, give an earnest compliment about something; nothing inappropriate though. Depending on how they react, you can start to gauge if they enjoy that particular love language style. And the person's change in behavior can become quite noticeable if you get the right one. Once you figure their preference for love language, keep using that method one them with some regularity and, in theory, they will warm up to you in time."
soc_921369,socialskills,reddit_comment,361,"I’ll contest a few points. We do want to make you happy. We want you to want to feel at ease around us and not like it’s a chore. I personally am fighting flashbacks, good and bad. We go through a lot of support systems (usually toxic relationships/substance abuse/fucked up parents). Sometimes we need to lean a little heavier. In those times, I think there’s something going on. Whether it’s a deficit in therapy, or one of the other support systems is crumbling/gone, those are the times where we’re a little more needy. When we’re out of balance when it comes to purpose, direction, being wronged, or a stressful period, we need some individual attention. I’m using we a lot. Everyone is different, but the more I learn about it, the more I realize I’m not alone (even though I feel that way a lot). It’s not real. I try to tell myself that. Whatever implosion I’m imagining, it’s not as bad as I think it is (as I self whallop different choices that seem like one deja vue after another). 

I guess all in all, your friend needs you a little more right now. It’s like that with us, but it man...we couldn’t do it without you guys. 

Shared experiences and understanding might bring them out of their shell a little bit. Have patience, teachable moments, and if your other friends are understanding-they can all become support systems. It takes a village, but you don’t want to burn yourself either being THE go to guy. Best friends are best friends for a reason, but if your friend is off kilter right now, a balance of social experiences and individual hangouts are really important. Part one is the experience outside of their normal routine, and then an opportunity to discuss it with someone they trust. I swear to god, I learn things about “normal” people and families- and I have revelations like “Wow! You guys don’t make fun of each other’s goals and dreams?” -cue Owen Wilson face.

You can have fun with a friend and make good memories or you can jerk off alone in a dark room for months or years to come.

Your choice.

soc_1381695,socialskills,reddit_comment,305,"I'm not going to lie to you, a lot of women will potentially see you as a threat, whether it be because of your statue if you're a taller guy, or simply because you're a man or, sadly, because of your race.

The important thing here is, context matters. This is just my perspective as a young white woman, I obviously can't speak of every woman on the planet. 

Sitting next to a girl in a lecture, completely okay (maybe ask her before just to make sure tho)

Sitting next to a girl in a empty subway, kind of awkward but I'll manage.

Talking to a girl next to you in class/during lunch/at a bus stop with other people around, perfectly fine.

Talking to a girl that's obviously alone ( especially in the dark), not so okay if there's no clear signs she wants to talk to you.


It all depends on the situation and the context. The best way to approach a woman is when there's other people around and you ask her if she's okay with talking to you/you sitting next to her. If she says no, accept it and move on, physically and emotionally. Don't bug her ""why not"" ""but I'm nice"" etc. Just say ""okay"" and move on. go back to texting on your phone, pick a different seat etc.


But I think you're overthinking it. I know with women talking about their bad experiences with men a lot it can get confusing what's right and what's wrong. A good rule of thumb is to just see how the person responds. Does she seem uncomfortable, eyes darting around looking for an excuse or a way out? probably time to move on. If she seems engaged in the conversation with you, is open and friendly, then go ahead, talk to her etc."

Istead or avoiding the uncomfortable atmosphere that going to a party solo creates, you dove head first! And it was your first ""real party"" which must have added anxiety towards your decision to go. That takes an enormous amount of courage and says a lot about you. Props.
The fact that you feel as though it didn't go great isn't worth focusing on; it's just a minor detail of the event. Remember, ""Rome wasn't built in a day"" and likewise you cannot reasonable expect your first attempt to be a success (this is true for anything in life). Not to mention, Rush parties are some of the most difficult parties to assert yourself as a newcomer because of the competition between the pledges. All the pledges are fighting for time to kiss ass to the brothers/sisters. Seriously, don't sweat it.

My advice would be to continue to throw yourself out there and only have small obtainable expectations. Next party you show up to, try and make one friend, introduce yourself to 10 people, try and make someone laugh, etc. Social skills are *skills* and as such they can only be obtained through experience. Best way to become good is to get more and more practice at it. To become an expert at anything (according to Malcom Gladwell's *Outliers*) requires 10,000 hours of doing it, so get busy!

soc_893070,socialskills,reddit_comment,712,"You know, sometimes certain neuropsychological pathways are set by the age of 3-4 years old, and the earlier they are set, the more difficult it is to undo them.  And that's part of the reality and, in some ways, the injustice of life.  So a distaste for human company may be an amenable feature of your persona, or it may be an enduring trait.  But if you're genuinely happy alone, then that's fine.  There's apparently a difference between loners who are content, and select to be alone because they prefer it, to loners who are alone not out of choice.  A person who is bullied and traumatised is an interesting cross-over between the two sets of loners, and consequently there will be aspects of aloneness that you actively choose and prefer to company, but maybe some minor or major parts that you would not choose over company.  I guess you have to figure out which matches your needs/preferences.  

&amp;#x200B;

Studies on animals, specifically in this case, pigeons, show that the socially included animals/birds have high cortisol (stress) levels when removed to isolation for a period of time, whereas the socially excluded animal had lower cortisol when removed to isolation.  I think it's like that with many of us humans.  Many of us, after traumas of various types, are just altered into people who prefer and feel safer alone.  Maybe not our optimal state, as we probably are social animals, but probably given the irreversibility of some emotional trauma, our happiest possible state.  I always picture the pre-cogs from Minority Report, who were happily tucked away in a cottage, free from all trauma, at the end of the film. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe a relatively isolated life is a viable option.  It's not spoken about or approved of in many extroverted societies, but over the aeons of human existence, there have always been loners, eccentrics, hermits, monks, mountain men, etc.  If you are happy on your own, and most comfortable doing activities you enjoy alone, then why do you need to change?  Just to keep others happy?  Just to appear normal and avoid further exclusion?

&amp;#x200B;

You get to decide how life looks for you.  What would your ideal life look like if you could choose it?

The only thing I would say is perhaps in need of some care/attention is the sense of apathy or lack of empathy towards other humans.  Sometimes that's a sign of some form of psychopathy/sociopathy (I say those in the DSM-IV/psychiatry sense, rather than the pejorative sense), and I note your username which may just be used in jest, or may represent more.  However, it might be worth getting a form of assessment to see if you have a more enduring form of psychopathy, and getting feedback on whether any of your actions/interactions with others are traumatizing/hurting them (eg, family etc).  Sometimes, life deals you a crap hand, and by a young age you're so traumatised you can't feel any more.  It really happens, and it's a sign you've been failed by others early in life (people failing you probably had a crap ton of inherited trauma too, so the pattern goes on).  But if you do find out you have a diagnosis of psychopathy, it may lend more weight towards your decision to withdraw from relationships/society to a greater or lesser degree, to protect them.  And in addition, you're going to want to never full indulge in your tendencies (which may include an almost cold-blooded clinical desire to provoke/test how much others could tolerate) and avoid hardcore pornography and hardcore violence in films to avoid satiating sides of yourself that can rapidly escape your control.  It wouldn't be your fault that you have psychopathy, but there remains part of you that can be held responsible for the choices you make with the personality you've got.  Contrary to what many think, it's not a foregone conclusion that psychopathy leads people to harm others - there's many out there, perhaps they are loners or whatever, who co-exist peacefully whilst having psychopathy.  They just honestly don't care for human company and that's all.  You can 'care' about people from afar, maybe working so you can afford to donate to good causes, supporting people online, sending gifts to others etc."

Depending on where you live (and covid restrictions of course) may I suggest you try some form of partner dance? Lindy hop, west coast swing, tango, salsa, bachata etc are usually very friendly communities, and very welcoming of new people.

soc_1841935,socialskills,reddit_comment,232,"On a basic level, in the beginning, people with great social skills aim to break the ice (even if they are more interested in tangible or philosophical things) therefore they tend to stick to easy to digest conversations/topics (like people/feelings or the weather etc). They save the deeper conversation for later.

Once they have passed that stage of small talk the rest of the conversation boils down to personal preference. You get a picture of what kind of person they are. Some people just generally prefer to keep all their conversations light and others will get deeper, out of the surface level area. That’s not to say that one preference is better than the other, as I said it depends on the person. 

Dont force yourself to be someone you’re not, except maybe engaging in small talk in the beginning. There’s no point in striving to be more like the other side of the coin when you pass the small talk stage because it easily backfires. Talk to people with similar interests if you have a choice. Then again in some scenarios you don’t always have a say in the matter because you can’t always choose who you need to speak with. In that case it’s better to stick to small talk. Sometimes you will be stuck in that stage and never move on past that into deeper, less surface level things."

[Watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kZg_ALxEz0)

First off, I noticed in your responses all you do is say ""I'm not doing that."" in some form with some excuse as to why you can't do that. ""I cant drink for medical reasons, and I'm not going to a bar alone."" Does that sound like someone you want to hang out with?  Would you want to hang out with someone who every time you offered a suggestion on something to do they shot you down?  Would you want to hang out with you?  Do you have a selling point?  If you were a product, what value do you create for other people?  Are you funny? Are you interesting? Because from what I can gather from your responses to this thread, you provide no social value to others.  You're negative, condescending and seem to think you are above the value others have placed on you.  

I used to be in the same boat as you, I thought I was better than I was treated.  I wasn't.  My social value was set way higher in my mind than it was with others.  I finally gave up.  I didn't know how to create value for another person to want to hang out with me.  I got a voice recorder and set it in my pocket for a day.  When I played it back, I was so annoyed by myself I stopped listening after the first hour.  I was negative, everything out of my mouth was a complaint.  People have enough of their own problems, why should they listen to yours?  I read a book, a pretty famous one called ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" by Dale Carnegie. I realized with the one recording of myself for a single day in basic social interactions how I wouldn't even want to hang out with me.  

You need to create social value.  You need to be someone people want to hang out with.  How do you become a person who people want to hang out with? Let's start with the basics.  You need to feel good about you.  

*Step 1:* Go for a run.  Not tomorrow, not in an hour now. Exercising helps the body release chemicals that make you a happier person.
 
*Step 2:*  Make a list of all the things you like about yourself and your personality. 

*Step 3:* Make a list of all the things you dislike about yourself.

*Step 4:* Figure out a way to change one of those things on the second list **TONIGHT**.

**Do this shit *now*.  Don't procrastinate like a bitch.**

The best lesson that I have learned is I am better off now if that hot chick in the corner rejects me than if I never approach her.  You might say ""But Klman0225, my feelings got hurt.""  Fuck your feelings.  If you don't go out and make her your friend, your date, or whatever you want from her because you are too scared of your feelings getting hurt, that is a worse result then her turning you down, because now you have to see her go home with a ugly motherfucker like me who had the confidence to go talk to her when I went to the bar and didn't make some lame excuse about why I couldn't go out to the bar by myself on a Friday night.  You can't drink? Don't. Go to a bar to meet people, not get drunk.

You can tell me the leads are weak all you want, but you aren't providing any value that I can see.

Sack up and go make things happen or wonder why no one ever comes around and offers you a lamborginhi, your choice. It's fuck or walk out there.  People are literally sitting at bars waiting to meet you, are you gonna meet them?"

Talk to them like you would talk to anyone else. Just keep it relevant and age appropriate.

You're certainly not expected to play with a child that you don't know, all that's really expected of you is to not hurt them or be mean to them since 90% of the time the child isn't trying to hurt you or be mean to you. It's ok if you smile at a kid and then they get shy, that's normal, you didn't do anything wrong.

I love children but I'm not one of those women that goes ""Ohhhh my gawwwwd you're so cuuuute! Hi! What's your name??"" I'm a quiet, chill kind of person and I like to let kids approach me if they want to rather than the other way around. You don't have to be super loud and active to be ""good with kids"". And it's ok to just not interact. Sometimes on the bus a kid will just keep staring at me and I won't really want to talk or interact. I just smile at them and then look away and do my thing. They're going to meet all kinds of people as they grow up and it's important for them to learn how to leave people alone too. Just try not to be too put off by the staring, they just don't know any better."
soc_928609,socialskills,reddit_comment,148,"Babysteps are my secret to getting absolutely anything done in my life. Whats the next possible thing I could do RIGHT NOW that would make even a tiny difference. The baby step is half the secret, doing it RIGHT NOW is the other half. 

I've discovered time and time again that If I don't do something RIGHT NOW, it will never get done. Because no matter how much you put something off eventually you have to decide ""okay NOW is the time to do it"" or else it will quite literally never get done. And that was a pretty fucking rough realization because I loved putting shit off until later because it allowed me to be lazy and still feel like I'll accomplish something because I'll just accomplish it later. 

Every time I fall into a slump it's the baby step RIGHT NOW mindset that pulls me out."
soc_1358951,socialskills,reddit_comment,343,"1. Be honest in your communication with others. Show vulnerability, but not in a way that presents you as having weaknesses or a lot to lose, but just plain, honest, intimate vulnerability - the type that says ""I'm willing to reveal a lot about myself but you could never compromise me with that knowledge"". It's a bit of a sweet-spot you must find. Talk about your struggles, be open, be willing share what you want to share (if people want to listen), talk to people as if you already have established relationships. But don't rant, it'll come off as oversharing. Don't go on a lecture without giving yourself the opportunity to soak up the feedback. Essentially, lead others by this example, and they will open up to you.

2. Develop listening skills, so that when people do open up to you, you can nurture them and thereby encourage them to continue, and keep the cycle going. I'd say good listening skills are a combination of: curiosity - knowing you can be enriched by any opportunity to absorb something new, confidence - having an opinion that won't necessarily being deterred if exposed to contrasting ones, empathy - the person will feel validated and not judged, and patience - not everything will be interesting but you can count on it coming.

3. Know that you can't make it work with everybody - so don't try to force it, or yourself, or others, or whatever, when it comes to getting closer to people. Don't get discouraged. Take any perceived failures (and successes) as examples to learn from. (Tip - lack of feedback from others is a form of feedback).

4. Know your self. This one is a bit of a catch because arguably it is something you progress in, not achieve. But the point is, the more you know yourself, the more your are honest with yourself, are closer to your true self, the more you can get closer to others. This basically reinforces all the other points here.

I wish you many enriching connections OP!"
soc_1281875,socialskills,reddit_comment,285,"I see your point, but as I explained on other comment. I did apologize to him and to her. Until later, he told me “I didn’t know who you were, sorry.” I found out later this day that he didn’t want to apologize, and did it bc she told her to. I do realize the comment could’ve come of as rude, but also as I mentioned her and I were talking about how great he was. Her justification and his apology, was that he didn’t know who I was and that’s why he did it. But in my mind there’s no need to be rude, How could you justify an insult because of a comparison with a nice person? As I said we were talking about how great he was. Then quoted I said, “he kinda looks like him, also (referring to him) your personality seems to be just like his”. I share this history bc many people think that they should tolerate this kind of behavior, I’m not saying I’m perfect, or that I’m the nicest person in the world, but I’m always helping people, never complaining, and I was especially very nice with her. I always supported her, and she still behave poorly with me, I do think I was wrong and accept it, but he didn’t need to react like that. If someone or something makes you feel bad, they don’t get to decide that it didn’t. That’s why I had the complaint bc he try to justify it in order for him to diminish that the situation was bad. But I will never compare anyone again, even if it’s a good thing. I appreciate the comment tho, I hear you. :)"

soc_724240,socialskills,reddit_comment,196,"It sounds like you have a lot of opportunities in a lot of different places. I know it’s hard, but being yourself and having confidence to start a conversation goes a long way. Maybe everyone else feels just as awkward or anxious as you. Make the first move. Worst case scenario: you don’t make a friend. That’s it, but now you don’t have to wonder if you missed out on something. Chances are most people are going to want to talk and be friendly too. It’s not easy to put yourself out there, but it’s better than feeling like you’re not even trying. 

Weed does not help with social anxiety for some people, instead it makes it worse. That’s how it is with me. I know I talk too much and it makes me feel sad after. I hate it. That’s just my opinion obviously. 

You’re a great person, I can tell. Start believing in your capabilities! You will never know unless you try. You will start getting better at approaching people and attracting their attention.

soc_1654013,socialskills,reddit_comment,659,"—————————-JUST MY OPINION ———————-You still have time to figure out your goal and what you want to become in the future. 
However to know your goal or career: 
1) Career: :::: 
Figure if you have financial problems or not. Cuz if you grew up poor then you would definitely want to make more money eg: Software engineering or any job in tech. If you don’t have any issues financially then go for your passion: what you like to do in your leisure time. Doctors make many money too but that’s a really long road. And for Nurse, you will literally get mentally and physically tired. For teachers, you won’t get paid that much. Don’t even think about labour works if you want to get wealthy. Personally, i’d go for software engineering if i were your age cuz currently i have steeped into nursing already and i don’t wanna switch my major and waste more years yk. 
I understand sometimes you would feel like what if you fail. But i think it mostly depends on your discipline. If you procrastinate studying or homework’s dues, you will never feel satisfied anywhere you go. Basically, don’t procrastinate and keep working on your education cuz in the future you will be proud of yourself. Try to make routine like waking up at a specific time and sleeping. Teenagers should get 8-9 hours of sleep, if you stay really late playing phone then you’re literally losing your discipline; no outcome from being on phone. It even worsen your eye sight damn. If you like to dress up and love clothes then i feel like SE is a good place cuz you get to dress up, but in medical work like doctors and nurse: you get to wear scrubs all day and brah so exhausting. Well, job in tech and medical, both have enough stress and is exhausting but - in tech, you will at least not feel physically exhausted for helping patient, you’re just doing your work on computer. These are my views btw, you don’t gotta agree w all those lol. 
2) Whenever you feel confused about 2 options: make a list of pros and cons. Then you can easily figure out or decide which one is more suitable for you. 
3) COLLEGE:::;; 
You said that your parents are making diff for you to focus of studying and i understand that. Try to go to college far away from your home. Well that act depends on your financial status. If you are financially stable then don’t worry. You should figure out that if you want to make a lot of friends or don’t really care about that. If you go to 4 years college or university then you would wanna go far away from your parents in dorms to get more experiences with ppl same age as you; that college life. You could get loan if your parents aren’t able to provide fees for your college. That’s y if you get in a decent money making career in the future then you could easily pay the loan back. 
If you just wanna live near your home then it’s fine. Or if you want to save money then go to a community college but know that you don’t get to make many friends your age and def feel lonely cuz of that. Less probability of making friends your age. But you will def save a lot of money while having stress staying with your family cuz i do too. 
4) Try to find as many as career first. Then find your interest in them while also looking at the demand of that job or else you won’t get a job after you get your degree. Eg: Psychology which is a  job difficult to get for average pppl. Let’s say you want to become a software engineering; try to take classes in highschool for that just to get an introduction on how hard that feels."
soc_189008,socialskills,reddit_comment,160,"This is a question only you can answer.

But the key is to realize that there's not really an objective measure of how much you struggle. Some people can take more than others in certain cases. Some victims get PTSD, some don't, even though you could objectively say both types of victims had similar experiences. So maybe it's better not to try to objectively weigh struggling.

The question is if 'getting by' is satisfactory to you. Would you rather be excellent or merely getting by? 

And do you think you're getting worse or better? If it's a downward trajectory you might want to get help before you ""struggle as much as the other people?""

The fact that you've written a post about it suggests to me that you could benefit from some help. It occupies your mind, so there's probably something that you'd want to change. That's a good enough reason to seek help imho. But that's my personal opinion."
soc_1359111,socialskills,reddit_comment,214,"If you are afraid of scaring him off here's some food for thought.

This love note idea of yours will DEFINITELY signal that you are interested in him romantically.

No girl writes shy handwritten notes to boys that they just want to be friends with. With your strat, you might as well give him a Valentine's Day card.

As much as a scaredy cat as you may be, this crazy idea of yours is gonna be a lot scarier than just saying to him casually, ""Hey, do you like chorizo?"", or whatever.

I think it could be a cute story writing a note like that. But it's entirely possible that he won't think so. I'd say if he's a teenage boy, chances are he'll be sympathetic, but my point of view is why take any chances. I'm like a lawyer, I don't ask questions that I don't already know the answer to.

soc_895217,socialskills,reddit_comment,330,"sadly you cant. Narcissists make up something like 1/8th of human society. With social media putting so much emphasis on personnal gain more and more people are see value in individuals with toxic behaviors. A good example of this is how people like trump or jake paul keep getting attention despite all the negative stuff they do around them. 

The point of it is that you have to just learn to read the signs. Sadly very little narcissists will admit they are one because it puts them at a disadvantage. My point is to stop trying to get rid of all the slow drivers or bad ones. Learn to just live with them. Trying to avoid stuff beyond your control is unhealthy so the best thing to do is sticking to people you know are good deep down and not just good because of circumstances.

From what I understand you were a victim of a similar relationship as my aunt but the thing that made her stronger after a year or two is the fact she realised she couldnt stay mad about my uncle. She went from being angry to simply accepting the fact he still exists. All she could do is ignore him and focus on the other 50 people in the family who still take care about her in a non ""strategic"" way.

The best thing you can do is cut the bridge between you and that person and just focus on other familly members. If you dont have familly to rely on just remember that what doesnt kill you makes you stronger and more prepared. Stay hopeful about life, there moght be a good portion of them out there but there still remains a good 6/8 to 7/8 portion of good people out there.

Its your choice to focus your energy on the negative stuff. No one is forcing you so just focus on the positive side of every situation. Its the best you can do :)"

soc_104510,socialskills,reddit_comment,684,"I've never been good at taking to other males, but talking and flirting with women comes naturally to me. Flirting is a two strep process in my mind. First is getting your mind right, then getting your words right  

Try to genuinely not care if she likes you or not; and why would you? There's a million girls out there you could be hitting on, what makes her special? Whether it's casual flirtation with a store clerk or something recurring with a co-worker you don't love her so even if you get shot down... who cares? Okay, now that you don't care you have no fear. That fear is what keeps your mind empty and mouth shut. 

Now that you're in the right mindset, on to the actual flirting. (This will be much easier with your nerves quelled. You'll be much more confident, and that confidence both makes flirting easier and you more attractive to her.)  The easiest way to flirt is to just... joke. Seriously, just riff off of the shit she says like you would with your friends. The only difference is that you can throw some sexual jokes in. She's already opened the door to talking about her boobs, which is pretty much a golden ticket to the v. Reference that past conversation in a joking manner. Example: 'hey Female, sweating much today?'
'Response.'
'Haha, you'll have to show me later.'


Once you've gotten a few conversations in it's time to get the number. It's so much easier than it seems, I promise. Since you work together it's going to be a cakewalk. Pretend to want to switch shifts with her, but be unsure. Say a friend mentioned a camping trip or a concert or something, and that you haven't hashed out the details. Ask for her number to text her about it later. Let her know the plans fell through, but thank her anyway. Ask what she's up to. Texting makes flirting even easier because you have time to come up with good responses. Use smiles, winking faces, and vaguely sexual wording. 

After you've been texting her for a week or two ask her out. Your conversations will have probably have given you some info on things she likes. Protip: ""we'll have to *insert activity* together sometime!"" is a very easy phrase to transition regular conversation into asking someone out. When she says ""Yea, definitely!"", just go for it. Ask what she's doing on a night you're free, and set it up. In today's customs most girls don't care if you ask her out in real life or via text, but I personally don't believe chivalry is dead. 

At this point you'll either actually like her or just want to get laid. Either way, be upfront, but delicate. You'll be surprised how far honesty at this part of the relationship goes. If you just want to fool around, she very well could be up for it and letting her know will avoid drama later. If you actually like her, let her know. It'll make her feel flattered if she feels the same way, or she'll let you know that she's not looking for a relationship now. You'll avoid feeling led on, and being somewhere between let down and heartbroken later on. 

One last thing to keep in mind. If she starts talking to you about other guys the window you have is closing. At first she's probably trying to make you jealous too see if you'll make a move. If you don't, she'll assume you aren't interested and most likely move on. You're stuck with your heart on your hands and a new best friend, and it's hard to get out of this situation, and nearly impossible to do without being an asshole as far as my exploits have taught me. 

Obviously everyone is different and these guidelines won't work on every girl you meet. The most important thing is to just be yourself; if she only likes you when you're pretending she doesn't like you. 

Edit: Fixed spelling, added last paragraph, and added a few words here and there. "

Just act normal like you don't care do your own shit and whatever feels right. And as far as objectification of women goes here is the thing if someone is objectifies women then you probably can't do much about it cuz even if you try to change someone's opinion it's really hard to change people you should know that because for everyone of us it's really hard to change ourselves. Just like ik this comment won't change your opinion or feelings towards the objectification or oppression of women in the 21st century.

soc_844075,socialskills,reddit_comment,334,"Heeey, if you’re talking abt being seen as goofy, childish and silly, it could either be the delivery of how you express your point, the content of your words itself, a relevancy issue, or a confidence issue.

I tend to look at ppl crazy too when Im talking abt apples and someone walks up giving me their opinions abt oranges.
This could be whats happening to you. Sure both are fruits and they’re round, but perhaps the disconnect is the fact that someone is talking about the stem of an apple ( a small but distinct detail or a subject) and you’re just focused on thinking what you have to say is relevant because an orange has seeds and so do apples. What you’re saying is correct, but likely to be dismissed and looked down on/ disrespected ( if that other person is an asshole) because in that moment, your thought was irrelevant to the topic at hand (although though valid with some truth). 


I think you should practice being more open to examining what YOUR saying, and how you make connections from your point to theirs and their perspective. There’s a disconnect. Could either be your delivery ( lack of confidence in your own opinion... or too much confidence at the wrong time and abt the wrong thing, with the wrong message)  or simply the words that are coming out of your mouth. You might need a recorder.

It’s messed up but that’s how it works. Focus on yourself and healing your mental health and healing the reasons behind why you care so much about how others view you. Warning: this may take some time and you might want to give up because you’re not seeing results but the point is for you to stop caring so much what others think of you and instead care what you think of yourself. Eventually, people will come up to you and want to interact with you. Take it from someone who’s been on both sides- wanting attention and stepping back. People don’t respect desperate people. (Btw this doesn’t mean be an asshole to everyone. Just don’t try so hard like the whole gifts thing.) And if you’re desperate or trying too hard to get people to like you, even if you don’t say anything, people can tell by your body language, the way you speak, etc. So work on your self esteem.

Go for it and don’t sweat it! If she doesn’t respond well, don’t take it personally.

soc_1375830,socialskills,reddit_comment,573,"Hope you don’t mind but I saw you removed a previous post and just wanted to copy my thoughts over. 

The fact that you’re reaching out here I think proves you have some spark in you still, which is good to hear. I know deep loneliness. That’s my only preface. You have to break out of this perspective that you’re stuck in this situation, that nothing you can do will change it, and that it is anyone’s responsibility but yours to do so. Even if it feels like a lie. Not to diminish your efforts but you simply have not “failed” enough in your young life to know for sure you’ve seen all that’s out there for you and that you should be done. If you did, you’d have learned more or found a new passion or at least stumbled into a friend group of people that are decent enough to hang around. Maybe if you were like 50 and this was still the case then I’d have less to say, but even then there’s always another card to play. That’s what’s realistic.

Change up your environment. Do you travel? Can you move to a more exciting town? Get a roommate or two in a nicer place? You may think what’s the point if you’re going alone but the fact that you’re providing an experience to yourself can give you that fullness to life that makes people interested in talking to you. Could you volunteer at an old folks home? Maybe provide that comfort and support to other lonely people. Maybe they’d have some wisdom of their own. I don’t feel like looks really matter in terms of meeting people, so do your best to ignore the negative thoughts you have about yourself. It’s a self fulfilling prophecy that’s up to you to change.

Social skills are simply a muscle to be trained like anything else. Start small. One trick I learned that I do all the time now is when I’m at the cashier stand and there’s that quiet time during the transaction, I ask “how’s your day going?” It always gets a nice response. Do that for a month and I bet you’ll feel a little bit stronger with talking to people. Stumble through and treat yourself with grace. Your upbringing has no baring on today, on tomorrow. That’s on you now. And you can do this. Because we all can do this. You’re not especially worse than us or especially better than us.

I’m 35. In so many ways, my 30’s have been a revelation. I visited another country for the first time when I was 30! Canada, on my own, and it was amazing! Just crossing the border for the first time felt like scratching the crust layer off my life and everything felt fresh and new. I’ve also just in general learned so much about who I am and what I do and do not want in life and a lot of that has been while alone, and living alone. It’s so tough sometimes, but there’s just so much out there to discover and I know for a fact now the younger version of me was wrong in thinking there wasn’t. You can get better at this. You will get better at this. Just keep going.

You’re only 18 which means you have a lot of time to find the right people and feel comfortable with the right group of friends but I have empathy for you because I have a friend who has autism (middle school). He was on the spectrum but his condition was not as severe and he was allowed to be in our classes with little attention (some special attention here and there). But no one would speak to him as a friend, everyone would make fun of him on the side. I, regretfully, found myself also engaging in these mean comments and it wasn’t until I was assigned to be his “buddy” for the week by my homeroom teacher that I actually spent time with him and got to know him. 

Don’t worry too much about these friend groups lad. You’re life is very long and you are young, and as you grow older, people generally become a little bit more compassionate and empathetic. It sucks to hear that you’re doubting yourself as to whether you could get hired and that you’re unsure of what you want to do in the future, but my suggestion would be just to start with some small baby steps. Maybe start with small social interactions in stores (saying hi or hello to the cashier while checking out) or asking for help to find something. Just to increase how often you talk to people. Just a suggestion but whatever works for you. 

And it sounds to me like you have social anxiety, welcome to the club :) I always doubt myself and think 40 times before I say stuff to strangers and if it doesn’t come out right I contemplate on it for a while too lol. I understand where you’re nervousness and doubt comes from. I do hope that you’re able to find even just a friend or acquaintance that you can talk and interact with. But being a kid who isn’t on the autism spectrum, I’m assuming it’s not that easy to do. Please hang in there and maybe instead of worrying too much about how you interact with others and how they treat you, DO YOU! spend some time to yourself and figure out what you may want to do in the future now that you’ve graduated. If you’re around people that like the same thing as you, social interactions may seem a lot easier and natural. 

I hope this helps, sorry I couldn’t relate entirely, but I do know that anxiety of social interactions and feeling depressed about it. Oh and also, HAPPY BIRTHDAY (belated and all)!!"
soc_982227,socialskills,reddit_comment,205,"Spending nearly all of my working life in one form of customer service or another I’ve learned to deal with crappy comments calmly. Your mom’s comment was down right nasty, I would have calmly said “I did wave and I’d appreciate it if you didn’t refer to me as a bitch” and then just left the room for a minute. Your dad’s comment was much less mean and is probably something he considers as mild ribbing, I’d just say “It’s a good thing I’ve got my glasses and never leave home without them” or if you think he could take what he dishes out then turn it back and say “and yours is still 20/20?”

I know it’s annoying and can be grating but it’s up to you to respond without getting snippy if that’s truly what you want to change. You know your mom can be nasty so practice some retorts that won’t stoop to her level and accept she may or may not apologise or change her ways. It probably gets to your more now than before because you aren’t as exposed to it as you used to be so it’s extra annoying. Also what adult wants to be talked to like that."

Its just giving pointers of qualities that are socially norm for what confidence is considered as. Whether this is helpful or not depends on your wanting to integrate in what the current definition of society is. Whether this is right for you personally is your choice, which much be respected.

You said....’ . Until a relationship gets more emotionally intimate that’s all that’s required to participate if you don’t want to talk much. Then if someone has been carrying the bulk of the conversation effort make sure they don’t walk away feeling awkward and like they embarrassed themselves by talking way too much by thanking them for opening up to you, or thank them for taking on the burden of the conversation and that it was nice to be able to listen."

soc_806458,socialskills,reddit_comment,217,"When it comes to 'making friends' I think it's easiest to go into each conversation knowing what you are looking for in a friend (similar interests, good conversationalist, ""good person vibes""). And also watching for red flags, (catching lies, even white lies, overtly negative attitude, etc). 

I believe the awkwardness comes from the fear of disapproval or denial, but everyone is different so that may not apply to you. In any case if you go in not worrying about what the other person thinks of you, you can focus on them, as well as my next point...

... How you want to present yourself to other people. This is the hard part for me, because I know how I want myself to be viewed by others but it's not as easy to execute all the time. I try to keep it simple by just being honest. You won't become friends with everyone, but the friends you do make will be real ones.

Having said that... There's obviously nothing wrong with what you're doing. If people think it's strange it's because they're most likely introverted and the thought of going out and randomly befriending strangers in a new place js a stressful and mentally exhausting experience.

Anyway, good luck and I hope this was helpful in some way."
soc_382744,socialskills,reddit_comment,417,"I’ve had some friends not 100% like this but definitely with the no social media, not keeping in touch, being difficult to reach or meet up with, etc. Honestly, when people are more difficult to keep in touch with or be friends with, it’s not remotely surprising when others stop bothering as much or at all, or if they lose friends. :/  

I’ve had friends who are well meaning but drop off the earth here and there (esp. those with chronic pain or depression). When they come back I’ll talk to them, but I’ve learned that they’re not always available so I let them come to me rather than sending a bunch of invites and messages into the void.  

I’ve also been the one to get lazy or hermitlike and fail to keep up with people, but I’m not surprised if some of my relationships I haven’t been tending get weaker or fade.  

It’s just kinda how life works.  

You sound like you’ve been super nice going out of your way to be friendly with Kate here, but you really don’t have to be doing this when she isn’t really helping herself.  

In my honest opinion, from what you’ve written here, she sounds like a huge drag—huger than my difficult-to-reach friends. Worse because she sounds actively bitter and negative and therefore also an emotional drain. I personally wouldn’t want to be friends with someone like that.  

Of course it’s up to you on how involved you want to be with her. It sounds to me like you aren’t really happy here though. If you want to fade from her entirely, it’s 100% understandable and you are absolutely not a bad person for doing it. She’s where she is because she’s doing it to herself, and it’s not your responsibility to fix it for her. Don’t let anyone make you feel guilty about it—if you pull back and she reacts, or if she complains that you enjoying your life is making her feel bad (because it shouldn’t!) If you don’t want to 100% cut her off, that’s totally doable too. You can always test out dialing back your involvement a bit here or there and see how things go. I have friends I’ve kind of given up on on my end but if they message me here and there I won’t shut them out. And sometimes people just drift apart and don’t connect as well as they used to, and that’s okay too.  

Good luck in any case!"
soc_1077261,socialskills,reddit_comment,704,"Only you know yourself, so my answer is just projecting myself onto you, so ideally it resonantes with you but it might not.

So, my answer is: **lack of self-confidence** which is caused by a **fear of belittlement** based on your thoughts. This is something I deal with too. Like you, I have solid conversations with myself and as I soliloquize I express my ideas clearly.

Now, I know it's not a ""talking to yourself is different than talking to others"" dynamic because there have been people who I could talk to like I talk to myself. But for the most part, that isn't the case. I can tangent about those specific relationships, but it's not worthwhile for this post. All that needs to be said is: it's the confidence they instilled in me that allowed me to be liberated with my thoughts with them, it was nothing I did. The bright side of this is I've analyzed what they did and therefore started to apply it with other people so that they become the utmost thought confidence with me. But yeah, with these people, amazing conversations. To be positive about myself, since the rest of the post is more negative, I am excellent at conversing with people (so long as I feel confidence)!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;My head just seems completely empty in those situations.

And I believe this happens because the mind is not liberated. It is focusing on the anxiety, the potential belittlement. It is working, using brain energy, brain space, to think about what is something that is low-risk to say and what ain't. When I have full liberation, my mind don't even think about that shit. So, it's using all the brain power on new ideas to bring up. The brain is 100% focused on the words, idea exchange, and not using half its energy putting up and maintaining shields, a defense mechanism.

Alright so because I understand my cause, I know that to fix it, I must eliminate this fear of belittlement. Now this fear, this defense mechanism, is deep rooted in me, as it goes back to how my ""raisers"" treated me. It's a deeply seeded defense mechanism, and I honestly don't have the answer on how to fix it. But here's what I'm currently trying, just something I planned out a few weeks ago...

I'm going to start with voice calls (and eventually get to in-person interactions), and during these voice calls, I'm going to read out a theme, question, thought, etc., that I had that I would otherwise feel ashamed about asking. And the idea is that, hopefully over time, my brain realizes that none of these themes are shameworthy to bring up. Because the battle here isn't a battle of logic. I've been logically aware for years upon years that these ideas, questions, themes, thoughts, aren't shameworthy thoughts. It's about certain emotional reactions, and so I cannot logic my way out of it. I have to rewire my brain somehow. And this is my next attempt at doing so.

My previous attempt, or ""position"" in this series was doing it with emails. And it has worked. So like, I feel a lot less nervous or anxious about sending certain thoughts and questions in emails to people who I don't have that liberated confidence around or with. Like a first, I would be tripping and go back and fourth with myself about sending these emails for like 10 to 30 minutes. Now I don't even give it a second thought, when it's thru email.

So now I just gotta put myself on autopilot (ie: reading) to bring up certain themes. Nothing I've ever broughten up this way or in the emails has ever caused belittling, shame, drama, etc., in most, most has been received positively. And logically, I could predict this. But like I said, deep-rooted defense mechanisms and ""emotional macros"" (like recurring emotional reactions to the same stimuli). Those things been fucking with me.

And yeah, hopefully this works and I'm able to feel liberated thought confidence with all people in all situations, from an emotional perspective. The goal is that the logic is what keeps me from being inappropriate, rude, etc., and not the emotions."
soc_287979,socialskills,reddit_comment,355,"I'm sorry things are rough for you. Something I've found in my own life is that the number of friends I have and the loneliness I feel tend to go up and down a lot. If I have a job where I like the people around me, or if I was in school in a class where everyone interacted a lot, I made friends. Sometimes the friends gradually fade away and don't get replaced quickly. The downs are really hard, but I do believe that circumstances will always change, especially if I'm like ""I hate how things are and I need to make some changes.""

Sometimes when I don't like how lonely I feel, I try to take a good hard look at what *I'm* doing. Am I being open and friendly, or reserved? Am I listening enough? Am I even interested in the people around me? Do I like them? If I'm in a phase of depression, I'm probably reserved, bitter, sad, negative, and very down on myself. I resent other people for their happiness. If you find yourself feeling that way, therapy is really helpful. Books about depression might also be helpful.

There's a great old book by Dale Carnegie: ""How to Win Friends and Influence People."" It challenges the reader to change their social approach to other people.

Self love is something that eludes me too. I struggle with this a lot, so I'm not going to tell you to snap out of it and learn to love yourself because your life will change blah blah blah. Humans are highly social, communal animals and I really do think we need other people. I would agree with the other posters that you should try, and keep trying, to put yourself out there. Not just with girls, but try to find your people. Do you like video games? Join a club or a meetup where people like video games. Stuff like that. 

Good luck! I hope things get better for you soon. I have felt what you describe, recently even. It was all-consuming, and felt like it would never change. It will totally change!"

One time we went to a club and believe me, 2 or 3 very attractive girls there were staring directly at him, one of them stood up (she was a little drunk) and talked to him and started flirting with him.

soc_10055,socialskills,reddit_comment,224,"This isn't a problem in your rational mind, this is a problem in your more primitive emotional self.  That part of you will only learn through experience.  Right now it believes that failure is death.  You need to show it that failure is not that bad.  You can't break through that barrier b/c your mind is trying to keep you alive, therefore you feel it is physically impossible to act.

How you proceed is up to you, but you need to fail very slightly at first and then up the amount of failure over time until your brain recognizes you are fine.  Trust me, you can only stay at full blown fear reactions for a limited period of time.  Your brain recognizes you are not dead, and next time the reaction is softened.

Depending on where you are, you may start with something as simple as going into public with a shirt on inside out.  You could go to trivia night with friends, and secretly, get the questions wrong.  Hell, raise your hand in class and give the wrong answer.  Create the situations that you worry about failing in, and fail.

When you are ready for the ultimate level of fail, you could create a post on Reddit with a typo on it.  If you can handle that public shaming, you can handle anything."

1. Look them in the eyes. For the entire handshake. When you're going in for it, and after you let go. This is incredibly important.

2. Shake their hand very firmly. Man or woman, doesn't matter. Some people say don't shake a woman's hand firmly, I think that's bullshit.

3. (Personal preference.) Shake it just a bit longer than it feels comfortable. From my experience, most people perceive that as a display of confidence. Just my experience. 

4. Shake everyone's hand. Example: There's a group of people, one of them being your friend. Say hey to your friend, shake his hand, then everyone else in the group's hand too while introducing yourself.

To take your owl example, I'm not gonna tell that to every single person I speak to in a day, but I would probably tell a few people that I thought would find it entertaining if I have a good relationship with them, and it usually sparks a conversation about when something similar has happened to them. It's a way of opening yourself up to people, and allowing them a chance to open up to you. People like to feel that they can relate to others and it makes them feel good that you can share the little things with them. "
soc_1836805,socialskills,reddit_comment,505,"I relate to this 100%

 I've spent too long in situations where I prided myself on being ""funny"" or event doing a slightly quirky thing because I know it will make my coworkers laugh or make me feel a connection to my supervisors. Every time someone laughed in my face I'd laugh back because it felt like  ""positive feedback"" yay we are all having fun! I've allowed people to give me stupid nicknames and I often thought its fine to laugh at myself. I would also end up telling family or friends this stupid nickname or a story and they would be horrified about the way I am treated and they would sometimes look at me with pity.

Then I read something online and I had a light bulb moment, it said : There is a difference between someone laughing with you or laughing at you. and I realized that for too long people have been laughing AT me. I turned myself into the joke and that was not okay. and deep down I already knew it was not okay because it made me feel bad about myself when the moment was over. When I am off the stage when I am not preforming for their entertainment I was overcome with heaviness in my chest. 

of course its still work in process for me but the realization is a good start. I realized that I need to have more self respect and more confidence because I deserve to be treated with respect.

Another thing I noticed is that almost all of the people who laughed at what I did could not handle being laughed at. They can dish it out but will not accept even a 10th of it. because like the other comment said they don't see you as their equal, they are ridiculing you and they know that. I've tried making a joke back at people and they would be so offended! because they value themselves too highly. So its up to you to stand up for yourself. 

Some nonconfrontational advice I think would be a good start for you: 

If she laughs in your face don't laugh back. you can ignore her joke completely. you can stare at her deadpan for a few seconds then turn away or even act annoyed and she should get embarrassed or get the hint that you were offended. If she is actually a nice person who maybe does not have malice intend but got carried away with ""joking around"" she should immediately stop when you are offended or if she senses you are upset. 

I had a passive aggressive supervisor who was always ""joking around"" and laughing at me and one time they made a comment in front of someone  I said to them semi-serious  ""oh my god stop making fun of me"" and they were so passive aggressive and non confrontational that just that comment was too much of a call out for them and after that they avoided me for a long time lol"
soc_817299,socialskills,reddit_comment,679,"Thank you for clarifying! :) Yes, do take it a bit slow at first, it can be a bit overwhelming if you move too fast and also I think you have a better chance of not getting rejected if you get to know the person a bit before making any advances. Makes them more comfortable, plus it allows them to decide that they like you before having to make a decision about how to respond to romantic advances (especially if you want to ask them out on a date or something, they are more likely to say yes if they had a chance to get comfortable with you and build up some trust and enjoy your company).  


In regards to people being unwilling to make any moves themselves, that can have multiple explanations. One being of course that a lot of people are shy and too afraid to make a move so even if they sense mutual interest they might be anxious to actually do anything. Another reason is that, unfortunately, a lot of people do still have the (in my opinion outdated) view that males are supposed to be the pursuers and females are to be pursued, and therefore some women will be passive and not make any moves because they think it's the man's ""role"" to do so. Which of course makes things a lot harder for men, especially if they're shy! I guess it's up to you to decide if it's worth it, I don't know what your views are on gender equality and such so decide for yourself whether or not you mind being expected to take all the initiatives or if you think the girl should make some moves too. Like you say, it can also be a matter of pride, in which case I would urge you to evaluate what that says about their character and if that's someone you still want to pursue...  


If you already know someone then that's great, you likely already got past the aforementioned step of making them feel comfortable with you, since you're not a complete stranger! It's a great opportunity to make more contact and eventually take the step to suggest hanging out privately (you don't have to call it a date, in fact it can take some pressure off if you don't, but it's up to you - of course calling it a date makes your intentions more clear but it's also a bit higher stakes so do whatever feels best), perhaps something in relation to the thing you have in common? I don't know why you meet twice a week but whether that's an activity you attend or school or anything like that, you can use that as an opening to suggest hanging out. Such as, if you go to school together you can suggest studying together over some coffee, or if you play basketball together you can suggest practicing together on a different day, lol you get the idea, try to use what you have in common to kinda ease into spending time together privately.  


Flirtation is unfortunately something you'll have to ask someone else, I don't know much about it at all! Frankly stuff like that has not really been part of my life, I don't leave the house so nobody gets the opportunity to flirt with me and even if they did I doubt I'd notice, haha. I do hope you can find tips for that elsewhere though! The only thing I can think of is giving compliments I guess, just don't overdo it. Also compliments are always best and feel the most genuine if they're very specific/non-generic. Like, calling someone pretty is generic, but complimenting someone's shading technique when they're drawing or noticing a small detail like a piece of jewelry is not. Specific/non-generic compliments feel more like you actually noticed something and felt compelled to point it out, rather than just resorting to something simple just for the sake of giving a compliment. Complimenting someone's skills or accomplishments can make them very happy because it's something they worked on"
soc_1079955,socialskills,reddit_comment,326,"It’s takes a good while to become friends with someone and be comfortable enough to have an open conversation. There are also formal settings that can create barriers to this process such as work, professional, educational, ect. 


Research suggests that it takes 40-60 of quality contact time to become casual friends with someone. It takes 80-100 hours of quality contact time to consider someone a friend. It takes 200+ hours of quality contact time to become “best friends” with someone. 


These are averages and will very from person to person. Also, consider that breaks in contact and other factors can “reset” this timer. There is also the chance that the people just won’t mesh well together and even after 200 hours they might not get along  or may even hate each other. 


So, a short answer to your question is you may need to be spending around 100 hours with someone before everyone feels comfortable having open and playful conversations. 


There are ways to speed up the process though. You can start by opening up yourself to show they other person that you feel comfortable and that can encourage them to do the same. Crack some jokes! Getting people to laugh shows your confidence and humor is a great bonding experience. Give your opinion on different things. Telling others what you think requires confidence and vulnerability, people will respond to what you put out there. Change the topic! Being up some of your hobbies, talk about your weekend plans, tell them about a vacation you have planned, ask them about some questions about their life. The more people learn about you and the more they tell throngs about themselves the more they feel comfortable in the relationship. 


If it feels like you are being too formal that is probably the energy you are putting out there. If you want others to open up to you then you need to relax and be more open with them."

Not sure how to explain it in the best way, but when I’m texting the guy I like I use “lol”, “haha” and the occasional emoji to show more interest than just typing the words I’m saying.

soc_766321,socialskills,reddit_comment,242,"The shot glass one, I can totally understand why that would be hard to connect to. Maybe next time a topic like that comes up, think about an object you really like, even if you don't collect them and then tell him about it. If someone's talking about their family, it can be Abit tricky because you have to decide 'is this person venting or are they informing?'. If they're freely speaking about their family dynamic and telling you about what they like to do and how they get along, maybe you could say 'well it sounds like they're a great group of people' or of course if it's bad stuff, 'well I'm really sorry you have to deal with that. It sounds like a difficult situation. I wish I could help you out but I've never had that problem because my family...' then you can talk about your family with them. If they're venting, the best thing you can really do is listen, make their feelings feel valid, and give advice if you have any. If you can't relate to their feelings, just hear how they're feeling and acknowledge it. 'Man that sounds awful, I'm sorry this person did that.' I hope some of these examples were helpful.

I was new at the time and they kept asking me work questions at random times and if I didn't know they would all gang up and laugh at me.

They would tell me things like ""Shut up!"" Or answer me sarcastically. Example one day I was looking for someone in the office and I asked them and they replied sarcastically ""I don't know!"" out loud...not in a nice way.

This went on for weeks btw without me doing anything.

So one day they called me a certain name. The name's in our native language and I'm not sure what the direct English translation for it is but the closest I can think of is 'Stupid'. So I replied by yelling loudly ""Hey stupid! Don't call me stupid okay?!' 

My superior heard this and asked me what was wrong with me and why am I so 'cranky' this week. 

Example 2: I asked an old school friend from outside of work for an opinion recently, and they replied ""Idk up to you.""

They always say this, so I got annoyed and told them they were rude. I said ""Honestly, your reply was quite rude. It sounded a bit like you didn't care. I know you didn't mean it and sorry if I offended you with what I said""

They replied ""Seriously? Everything I say is always wrong. Theres always this pattern with you. Not sure why you are so sensitive and go ask someone else for their opinion if this is too ""rude"" for you.""
Tbh I do tend to call them out more than they call me out for things. But we are close friends, we are supposed to be honest with each other right?

So there. Those were some of the many incidents in my life."
soc_981098,socialskills,reddit_comment,354,"I find it really hard to believe that random people come up to you on a regular basis to call you the n-word. That's not realistic. It's not how normal people encounter social situations. And even so, if that were to happen to you, 

&gt;Insults are meant to get a reaction and start trouble.

EXACTLY. The whole point is that if someone is giving you shit, they WANT a reaction. They want you to prove to them that their words have an effect on you. Why would you give that to them by fighting or starting verbal ""competition?"" You can instead simply choose not to give them a reaction. At that point it's clear to everyone that THEY are in the wrong, you realize that, and so you don't have to validate their insults with a response. This gives onlookers the impression that they are an asshole, and you have the confidence to not be threatened by immature assholery. When you react to someone's verbal aggressions, you give the impression that you care what they think and that your self esteem depends on their opinion of you. You're validating them by giving them the reaction they want (as you stated yourself, you know that's what they want.) If you make the mature adult choice not to validate them through starting a confrontation, the situation resolves itself naturally and the only one who looks creepy is the aggressor. 

Let me also mention that even if someone is being out of line verbally (insults, racial slurs, whatever) normal mature adults do not immediately react with ""smacking tf out of them."" That is not an appropriate response and it IS something that will make people think you are not only creepy, but mentally ill and dangerous. 

I know you really like calling people the r-word and you probably think I'm out to get you, but I'm truly giving you the best advice I can right now because I can clearly see you are struggling to understand certain social dynamics and that you need help. Please see a therapist if you actually want to improve your social interactions."
soc_809057,socialskills,reddit_comment,318,"I spent a good time thinking about this, because I'm 15 in the UK and kinda went through what you are going through, ADHD, autism and more. I can't tell you what to do from experience however, my reputation is funny haha man. That's it. I'm also known for knowing too much about everything, which makes people intimidated. I would like to change myself and your story has somewhat inspired me to think a bit about it.

Warning, there are a lot of question up a head. I thought about 4 when writing it and then decided, hmm ah yes ADHD. If you find that they are personal to you, you don't have to answer all of them but being as honest and unbiased as possible will help greatly.

What's your age?

What is the atmosphere between the school, teachers and students and how they act with one another?

What is your friendship group like?

How do your friends act in classes?

How do others act in classes?

Do you have friends in your classes?

do you get good grades, or at least above average?

How attractive are you, not in comparison to others? (Body shape, height, face structure, hair.), this is quite an important question because you can actually help all of those things without surgery. Just habit changes.

Do you have an interest in politics? If so, do you talk about it a lot?

What culture are you surrounded by? (left/right leaning)

Are you religious?

Do you have a fairly protective family?

Are you indoors at home most of the time?

Do you have an active social life?

Have you ever suffered a traumatic experience before? i.e socially, physically, mentally, emotionally? You don't have to answer this one to me but if you have I recommend seeking help for it, no matter how long ago it was.

soc_1199656,socialskills,reddit_comment,180,"Man life is so weird, people don't know how much happiness they can bring someone by simply being nice and not rejecting everything. I'm happy for you OP.

I also like how you didn't see the fact that your friends saw you as some kind of a ""I'm walking around with a trophy, that'll show them!""-moment!! I guess she picked up on how pure your intentions were.

Sadly not everyone is as honest with their intentions, so you kinda get numb to it and have to be an asshole to brace yourself against the 70% (personal estimation) of other assholes, people who just want to hook up or use you in another way or who make fun of you or come up to you in a group and want to show their friends how alpha they are.

If girls could assume most dudes are like OP, they could be nice and friendly and open. And if guys could assume most girls were like that girl they wouldn't be so afraid of talking to them or treating them like another species."
soc_72606,socialskills,reddit_comment,541,"I think your main problem here is you're not expressing your sexual intent. I agree with stinkyxxchickenfeet for the most part, especially the fact that in terms of confidence you were doing very well and she covers many of the reasons someone might ask if you're gay. But that wouldn't account for EVERY interaction, only maybe 50%. So I want to throw out this thought:

If you were being flirty and bringing the conversation to sex and getting slightly physical (but in a natural way, not creepy) and were **obviously communicating that you were attracted** There is no way a woman who was even slightly attracted to you would label you as gay or a friend.

Obviously everyone is different and this is just not 100% true in real life. Not everyone will see the signs you put out, even if you're REALLY obvious. Some women have insecurities that give them a blind eye to such things, as do some men. But the fact that you don't seem to be perceived as a man looking for a relationship EVERY TIME suggests to me you need to start expressing your sexuality a bit more. The top comment is one way to do this, but instead of working on using a line, try and see the feelings in the background. Start expressing how you feel by just doing the things you most feel like doing. If you're attracted, this might be to touch, this might be to want to bring the conversation to sex, whatever you feel in your body, just do it.

I invite you to not suppress them desires as much. If the thing you feel like doing is slightly inappropriate but probably fun, just do it. What's the worst that could happen? you get rejected. But you showed your sexuality, you expressed what you were really feeling, she didn't think you were gay and you now have a better idea of how and when to express that much. And if it does work (which it is very likely to) you'll feel really free because you're expressing yourself and feel more alive and confident than ever. If the girl is attracted, the combination of showing your desires and being so confident and free is more than enough to secure a date. As long as you ride it through for the rest of your conversation.

I'm not saying it's easy to express yourself (It's not, not at ALL), there is a lot of social conditioning as to how things should be done and trying to break out of that is really hard. A lot of it is that you're taught to be a ""nice"" guy, don't be too forward, pander to her whims etc. My invitation is to be an **honest** guy instead, live true to how you feel. You might get more emphatic rejections but when you find someone compatible (and there are many compatible people, trust me on that) you'll have some of the best times of your life. 

Just let it out

Hope this helps somewhat, even if it is poorly written. Please remember this is just my opinion so don't take it as truth, and good luck in your future attempts.

TL;DR: express your sexuality and intent more"
soc_125968,socialskills,reddit_comment,295,"Your attitude about yourself. Lack of confidence generally stems from how you view yourself; whether you look down because you're not in shape, been shot down, or any number of things that would lower one's self esteem. When you approach someone you can't think of that. Here are a few steps you can try.

1) If you feel uncomfortable in your body wear something that looks good on you that's also comfortable, by doing so you won't be worried if you look good because you in fact do. Since it is comfortable you won't be standing in such an ""awkward"" way to present yourself better. This is one of the big steps needed to feel better.

2) The idea of ""faking it"" is a good concept. When you talk to someone you can literally be anyone you want, given the fact they don't already know you. However I'm not saying you should lie to them, because if they find out they will most definitely be upset (your call on that one). Anyways by them not knowing your flaws you can focus on the good aspects you have. 

3) The hardest part of going up to someone, or a group of people, is the initial contact. Once the conversation is flowing then you're off in the right direction. Generally you can tell if it won't be going well given different signs. This is useful in dating, or just meeting new people to expand your social circle. Just try and notice the subtle non verbals. 

4) Don't over think. If you over think you could possibly psyche yourself out.

5) Have a good time. People who are having a good time always look more confident because they don't care about anything except good time and good company. "
soc_56903,socialskills,reddit_comment,552,"You really can't be this hard on yourself after only two weeks. A lot of the friends I made my first two weeks didn't even end up as acquaintances at the end of the school year. The social dynamics at the very start of college are very fluid, I think almost every sophomore would agree with that statement. I wouldn't worry too much about it now, but that being said it would be a poor decision to try and not become more social. 

Most importantly, don't limit yourself. It's nice that you have a few friends and maybe met a girl, but don't focus too much attention on such a small group of people so early. Expand your horizons and try to meet as many people as you can. Some you will simply not like, and that's fine. Some will simply not like you, and that's also ok. 

When you say that you aren't a very clever or witty person, you don't have to be to be appealing. I would argue that there are three factors that primarily cause people to like us. The individuals that we find ""cool"" and respect have these three things in common. 

1. They are high-value individuals. They believe in themselves, and know that they are worth knowing. They don't try to impress others, they don't need or seek the approval of others. They only seek self-approval, and this they have achieved. If you lack self-approval or do not have high value of yourself, try hitting up r/fitness, or r/malefashionadvice, etc. until you actually like yourself. High-value individuals aren't worried that they wont fit in, and they don't worry about what they will say to others. They stay true to themselves and of course everything else happens to fall in place. 

2/3. I'll lump these two together because they're so intertwined: confidence and friendliness. Confident and friendly individuals are the first to introduce themselves to a room of new people. C/F individuals smile when they see you, and are genuine when they ask you how your day was. They really want to know, and we appreciate this, it makes us feel better about ourselves and we are drawn to them. Think of a dog. When you pass one on the street, it runs up to you, introduces itself with a dog smile on its face and isn't afraid of how you will reply. If you walk away and ignore the dog, it doesn't affect the dog's day. If you stop and pet the dog, you and the dog are both happier from the interaction. You need to be like a dog, friendly and confident, not worried about how each interaction will end. 

Overall, it's the first two weeks and I wouldn't worry too much about the state of your social life. Give it time, let it breathe, and come back in a month or two if things still aren't going your way. In the meantime, try out my advice, it's worked for others in the past. If you only came away from one thing, it should be that you need to focus on being comfortable with yourself; trying desperately to impress others will never work out as well as you want it to. 

Good luck man. 

tl;dr: You should read this if you're serious about bettering yourself. "
soc_188684,socialskills,reddit_comment,239,"A lot of what you wrote strikes a chord with some of the thoughts I had/have: I can very much recommend a read of ""The New Psycho-Cybernetics"" by Maxwell Maltz, it was pretty life-changing in that regard for me. Your brain might automatically try to dismiss what you're about to read, so be warned and try to consider this: you're making a lot of negative statements about yourself, which you present to yourself (and us) as facts, when in reality they're not, but they're your opinions. If you're convinced that they're facts, then during the course of your life they will end up being facts for you. It's up to you to decide if you wanna submit to that, or if you're not gonna accept that and do something about it. Because one thing that I can tell you is that NOONE is ""meant to always be unhappy and uncertain"": though it might not feel like it, no invisible hand or power is forcing you into these thoughts, they're derived purely from you, your interpretation of past events, your attitudes to the future, your actions in every moment of your life.  
  The book could act for you as a framework to guide your thoughts and contemplations on your negative thoughts and feelings, and if you use it as such you might end up turning your life (and your opinions of it) around. So I'd say it's worth a try."
soc_1613733,socialskills,reddit_comment,232,"When your partner critiques it, does he actually say what he doesn’t like about it? Or does he just say it’s bad? Some things really are just a personal preference thing, so you shouldn’t take that personally (easier said than done I know). I’m not saying he shouldn’t be appreciative of you cooking btw, but if he tells you what he doesn’t like about it then it may take the confusion out of why he doesn’t like it. If he’s just saying it’s bad then that’s rude and annoying imo. 

If you really want him to like it then maybe you could try experimenting with his critique notes? Also, does your partner know how much you enjoy cooking? Maybe telling him that it helps to know what he likes about your cooking could work too? 

Also, the point about letting their negativity win was interesting to me. I can tell you enjoy cooking, but the people you serve to isn’t as receptive as you’d like and it’s making you feel bad. I don’t think not serving them food anymore is a matter of “letting negativity win” but moreso keeping your sanity and your love for cooking alive. You take pride in your food, but I’m worried that too much pride is gonna make you hate cooking altogether.

Try openning yourself up to the possibility of being friends with people who smoke or drink.  It doesn't mean you have to by any means.  And you still don't have to go clubbing or to parties. But it would give you more friends options.

I myself, am very naturally a compulsive liar. I don't necessarily do it to hurt people but usually rather to prevent confrontation. One of the last ""big lies"" I had was about a year/year and a half ago. I had been lying girlfriend about the severity of a long term health condition I have, trying to keep her from worrying. Eventually it came out how bad things actually were and we had an argument, albeit a very one-sided one, and I promised her I wouldn't lie to her again.

I've been truthful ever since.

I still feel the urge. A difficult situation comes up and lying would fix things so easily. It's scary how naturally it just seems to come to me but I still fight it. I grit my teeth and I tell the truth.

To all of you with similar negative aspects to your personality, i'll leave you with this. Everyone, no matter who they are, has negative aspects about themselves. You are not alone in that. Good people aren't naturally good, they make an effort to be good people.

soc_1209392,socialskills,reddit_comment,411,"Well first let me give you credit for trying to be playful and fun with people. That's a positive instinct for sure, and not one that you should lose!

But at the same time the reaction of these people is telling you that there's something off with the way you're communicating.

1) The good English speaker -- you're teasing her negatively about something she should be proud of. Pointing out how she got it wrong or didn't know. Instead you should tease her about how GOOD she is at something. Like in the same instance she didn't happen to know the word, you could've said, ""I figured you'd know it, you are SO great at English compared to the rest of us!""

2) If someone sends something that reminds you of something else, make sure the comparison is complimentary. He could've taken it that ""oh it sounds like you copied that."" You'd be better off just saying how much you appreciated it, or asked why he picked that quote, or said that you were inspired by it. In fact, he went on to try to explain the reason (because he felt it was important), and you cut him off, telling him it was a joke. That probably made him feel bad that he sent it. So try to APPRECIATE people instead of teasing them negatively.

3) Fitness trainer -- it's not necessarily bad that you noticed the similarity of the session, but by saying that to the new trainer, that sort of implied that the person was lazy or not creative. Instead I'd go with something you CAN compliment about the person -- their smile, their energy level, the way they motivate you, their commitment, whatever you think is positive.

Remember teasing is best received when it highlights people's strengths and how great they are. For example tease a friend about her great sense of style, or a guy friend about how he's always there to help or his awesome car or his skill at (whatever). 

People don't like to be teased about negative things, but they LOVE being teased about positive things, especially things that are awesome that others might not be aware of. (like they do charity work behind the scenes, or a skill or talent people don't know they have)

Learning to tease in a positive manner will greatly increase your own popularity with people. Your instincts are there so I know you can do that. Good luck!"

soc_927229,socialskills,reddit_comment,472,"Hey, 

Assuming these are everyday casual interactions with people who you don't want to upset, I'd recommend  redirecting them, refocusing the conversation, asking why, or shrugging it off with superficial responses. 


***Redirecting*** is basically distracting them. You can also use it as a trust test. For instance if someone's asking about which bank you're with on a topic about finance, redirecting would look like; 

Them, ""so yeah interest rates are the most important thing; which bank are you with?"" 

You, ""well, interest rates are kinda the same everywhere at the moment right? So low!"" 

It's like bypassing any examples they were going to use your information for, and redirecting them further along to the point they were in the middle of making. You could also follow it up with the exact same question to them. I do this sometimes when I'm wary of a stranger's questions, I respond with a generic statement and ask the same of them. The implication is clear, *trust me before I trust you*. 


***Refocusing*** is pretty much the same but works best when they are meandering and have asked something personal of you unrelated to the current topic. Super simple to just say, ""well, that's not really relevant to (current topic) is it?"", or ""wait, hold on, let's not wander off topic here!"". Combine this with *why* strategy to say ""why does that matter?"" or, ""what's that got to do with (current topic)?"". Get even more direct with ""why do you want to know that?"", but that's going into why territory now. 


***Why***. I often just tilt my head 30 - 40 degrees and ask ""why?"" in a curious voice. Perfectly reasonable question and it places the asker in the position of having to justify why they want to know and what point they want to make. If their answer is inadequate or you're just not convinced, their answer will probably give you lots of jumping off points for redirecting or changing the flow of conversation if you don't want to directly say, ""yeah, no, not convinced. Don't want to answer, thanks"". 


**Generic and superficial responses** are sometimes good for small talk and daily chit chat. A very basic response to the earlier question would be, 

1. ""whichever bank will give me the best rates, no loyalty over here! Lol"", 

2. ""man I've switched so many times I barely remember!"", 

3. ""that (random bank) sounds really good, you seen the ads? I'm thinking of switching to them"", 

and so on... You get the point. It's easy to navigate your way through conversation while giving nothing much away and still appearing friendly. As a general rule, ""what about you? "" almost never fails me when I want info from someone while avoiding giving them anything. 


That's just my two cents and a handful of things I find useful."

Skydiving is a blast.  Try it when you turn 18.  There's Groupons.  Goat yoga is a thing too.  It's crazy.  The goats will climb on you as you downward dog.  Have you ever tried boba tea?  Deep fried Twinkies?  Pork belly?

I'm not going to tell you to call a line and you are love love sap sap.  I can't do it.  I have antisocial personality disorder from being abused my whole childhood.  I don't have access to emotions.  So instead let me get logistical.  If you die before you try putting a slice of carrot cake into a milkshake you will have missed a real joy.  That's how you go on.  Don't concern yourself with the length of life.  Think about the breadth.  Set out to live it all and if you do you will find reasons to live.  If you shut in and watch porn then your only options are live for porn or don't live.  If you try everything you can live for anything."

soc_1396692,socialskills,reddit_comment,170,"Ignore them. Ask yourself, what's in your control and what's out of your control in this instance?   


You can only control your thoughts, actions and emotional responses. What other people say, think, do, or act is completely out of your control- and because of this, I don't let myself think about it further. You can't please everyone and people will dislike you, that's life.   


When people talk negatively about me, I ignore it (it happens). They look like the idiot when everything is said and done. Think about it, they think they know your life although you only work with them for 6-8 hours a day. They know very little about you, even the stuff you disclose to them. 

They're judging you based on a shallow level. You can't judge your coworkers nor strangers, it's all based on speculation of what they think something is. Only you know yourself and if you're doing the right thing and doing it to the best of your abilities, everyone else can \*\*\*\* off."
soc_369247,socialskills,reddit_comment,599,"I'm about to dispense some horrible advice, but it's all I have to draw on from my experience.

After years of being the guy who takes a back seat to conversations I feel outside of, or to which I have no contribution, I started preventing that moment of burnout you described with the abrupt, possibly inappropriate conversational tone shift. In the case of Tofu's divorce and money problems, I'd probably wait for a reasonable gap between sentences and blurt out ""dude, your life is depressing as shit right now"" with a cheeky smile to indicate that I mean no offense, and I'm sure we all acknowledge that it's pretty sombre subject matter. Then take my moment of focus - hopefully the other participants are at least having a bit of a chuckle at the unexpected interjection, though it's always a gamble - and move forward with something vaguely related to the keywords ""divorce"" and ""money"". Talk about someone you know who got divorced, or that time you were so broke you kept putting $5 petrol on your car every day because it felt like you were saving somehow, but it just created an oppressive panic as you stared at the invariably horizontal needle on the fuel gauge on your way to work. Timing will affect how natural this segue is, and there's no way it won't come across a bit like you're just trying to find a place in the conversation, but that totally is what you're doing, and usually people understand that. After all, neither your boyfriend or Tofu would claim your role was to sit mute until your name was called. I know this guy said he was getting to you, but I'd say after 10 minutes, it's your call as to when the conversation gets to you.

I understand part of your concern was that any effort you made to enter the conversation would appear insensitive while he was talking about something upsetting, but taking hold of the subject yourself allows you to steer the conversation somewhere a bit lighter without necessarily going off-topic. Friends like to laugh and have a good time together. You can be the one to make the conversation a little less dull. I know sometimes I can go a little too deep on a topic I'm deeply involved in, and it can really kill the vibe until someone blurts something out that opens the door for a more fast-paced group exchange. I don't take offence to the subtle suggestion that I've held the floor for too long, so it shouldn't be assumed that others will. I mean, sometimes they do take it badly, that's the risk you take for the potential reward of everything being totally chill. Results vary as much as people do, but it's never a friendship killer.

So yeah. That's the way I handle being conversationally third-wheeled, or whatever number of wheels there may be. If I had to estimate the success rate, I'd say 80%. The other 20% are blank stares and then the conversation picking up from before my interjection, while I down my drink and start daydreaming about cooler stuff I could be doing.

Alternatively, when Tofu finally asks you to tell him about yourself, you could say ""I like seeking advice about social conundrums on internet forums, and I abhor having to endure epic monologues from divorced, penniless men"". I'm obviously joking, but I was really trying to put myself in your shoes and ran several mental simulations to figure out what I'd do. This is probably one of those 'know your audience' things."
soc_278076,socialskills,reddit_comment,136,"I used to be very boring and shy in high school. Super reserved, only had one friend, the usual. 

Eventually I graduated and went off to college. First year I spent my time with my nose in the books, but second year I ended up with a party girl as my roommate and she took me to my first party. It sounds stupid and obviously it's not for everyone, but drinking was what helped me break out of my shell. A lot of people really liked my personality and they invited me around more often and really helped me get the ball rolling into being a more outgoing person. 

Like I said, not for everyone, but now even without alcohol, people find me equally as fun to be around. Just my two cents. :) Good luck!"
soc_860569,socialskills,reddit_comment,436,"I feel these ways as well sometimes though I feel like I have it in a bit better control nowadays (well the whole guilt thing, I’m getting better at moving past tiny instances like these without having too intense emotions or taking it personal and beating myself up). 

I had a counselor once in high school tell me I had cyclothymia- another said they believed I didn’t have a mood disorder but rather said that my anxiety would make my emotions more intense in a way, and for instance when I’d get very happy and excited and get the ‘high’ feeling I was in a maniac state and if someone was to say something during that time I would crash harder than usual. I found that part to be very true. 

My emotions towards movies, shows and such have gotten much stronger since my pregnancy and now I will cry at the smallest things, though I don’t often have a deep sense of depression unless it was a very good movie which then I sometimes think about it for days or can’t stop watching it. 

I definitely have strong anxiety when stressed at all and sometimes go into a huge downward spiral that has lead to self harm and even suicidal thoughts but once my ‘cycle’ run through and I feel better I look back and regret those thoughts or if I said anything to anyone because I don’t feel it is valid anymore. 

I find sometimes these thing interfere with my social life but my all around anxiety does the most damage and my strong emotions don’t make me feel more ‘normal’. Some people are annoyed cause I get passionate about random things and they don’t care to hear but it is consuming me at the time. Sometimes I am mean (defense mechanism usually) or overly sensitive and it starts fights or makes things awkward. 

Everyone is different so what my strong emotions are could be very different from yours but know you are not all alone in that department and I’m sure plenty of people would agree. I don’t think there is anything wrong with it really except when you overguilt yourself just because you shouldn’t beat yourself up. Easier said than done, I know. But have your passionate emotions and enjoy them :) I feel special that I can enjoy life so much sometimes. Also, look into being an empath maybe. I think I’m an empath and so I feel so strongly for other people and feel their emotions personally and in physical ways sometimes. 

I hope that helps you a little :)"
soc_1689476,socialskills,reddit_comment,213,"If you're actively questioning your behavior, most women will respect that in my opinion. I don't mind being approached by a stranger as long as you can acknowledge that most women get approached by men all the time and that makes us be on the defensive sadly. 
For me, I would find it respectful if first you apologize for stopping me in the street if I was walking, ask if I have the time to talk a little, and first and foremost, be polite. Ask for consent. On top of being uncomfortable with inappropriate wording, what i heavily dislike when men approach me is when they think they own the right to stop us in our day without asking first for consent. 
I can't guarantee this works for all women in the world, but it's certainly a green flag for me. It shows you value us as human beings. You value our time, you value our safety.

I know personally, no matter the context, I'd ask permission before talking to someone on the street.

Then, for what you say afterwards, I cannot help you. It depends on the person you are, the energy you have at the moment, the energy of the person you want to talk to. Being genuine calm and understanding."
soc_1243392,socialskills,reddit_comment,160,"Hi,

I am not the expert on social skills. But I would try imagine them in their own shoes.

You may not know everything about them and neither do I, but they can be very excited from seeing you for the first time or they behave differently in public.

If possible, what are their hobbies? Do they behave differently in different environment? For example, if they like video games, they may talk more freely during xbox one gaming rather than dance dance revlolution in main event, because of the noise and the ""need to behave properly"".

Everyone is different, so I don't know much about your friends. You will need to find out what make your friends comfortable in social setting.

For instance, I have hearing loss. If someone was talking me at the volume at which I can't hear. I would just blank out and not say anything. Because I would be too afraid to speak out.

Best regards."

But these  days, I got sick, I felt so bored and can't do anything. I don't have  anyone to talk to except my wife and my daughter.* 

well damn man...not to sound negative, but if you have a good wife and daughter, you have a LOT  O.o   so that's something to feel good about, right?

&amp;#x200B;

*I don't want to bother  my mom, dad and sister, because I don't want they worry about me.*  

why? go ahead and bother them. if they worry, they worry--that's their responsibility as your family. that's their duty. they're stuck being part of a family--make them earn that shit  ;)  that's what they're there for. don't underestimate your family members. they just might be tougher and more resilient than you give 'em credit for.

you guys all have each other, so why not take advantage of your resources? make the most of it. i would  \^\_\^

&amp;#x200B;

*Besides, I have basically 0 friends, I used to think that I have a lot  of friends and close friends but turn out all wrong. Only me care about  them, asking them and nobody ever care about me, even they envy me.* 

well hell dude, in that case, fuck them. if they didn't reciprocate, they were never your friends anyway. you didn't lose anything--you gained something by cutting them loose.

i get that you feel betrayed, but look on the bright side: you discovered that these people weren't really your friends at all. hell, be happy it didn't take 20 more years to discover that. 

&amp;#x200B;

*One  day, I just realized that and removed everyone out of my life.*

haha, nice  ;D   balls to the wall, burning bridges, no holds barred. i like that  ;)  sometimes too far is the only way to go. if you ask me, i say you did the right thing. we only have so much tolerance for jerks, and once that last straw touches the camel's back, it breaks--and there's no repairing it.

good for you. i say you did the right thing. i would have done the same  &gt;:D

&amp;#x200B;

 *I really  like there friends or people in general maybe just because of my nature,  but they always make me disappointed, sad and they betrayed me. Back to  my wife, she doesn't ask or care if I feel tired or not, although she  still cooked for me. It made me even more lonelier.* 

ok, well...i can't judge your marriage, because i don't know you guys. and i'm not sure how long you've been married. 

marriage is a shitload of peaks and valleys, and often, it's more about tolerating someone than being madly in love.

bro, i've been married 20 years now, and a lot of the time i'm TOLERATING the old lady--and she's tolerating me.

hell, just this evening we were bitching at each other over some stupid little thing. it's barely worth mentioning, but that's just how it goes. 

she still made some dinner. we still kissed goodnight. it's really not a big deal. maybe the old lady just wasn't in the mood for dealing with your shit tonight. maybe she was tired herself, or had something on her mind. women are just people too. none of us is perfect. 

marriage might be popularly portrayed as a bed of roses, but most of the time, it's more like the Arctic. you gotta keep your head down, bundle up, and keep your feet moving forward--or you won't survive. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Sometimes I feel  this life is so meaningless, we work, we love, give, but in these weak  and vulnarable time, I just got nobody to talk and share. So fucking  hate that.* 

life IS meaningless. in about 100 years or so, EVERYONE on the planet right now will be dead. and very few of us will be remembered, even the ones who seem like they're on top of the world right now.

i bet 95% of people couldn't name the 29th President of the United States, and 99% of them couldn't tell you one thing he ever did, good or bad. and he was PRESIDENT.

probably 90% of people couldn't name 10 former presidents, not counting Obama and Trump. 

95% of people couldn't name 5 hit songs from the 1950s. 

and those people were on top of the world in their day. they rose. they fell. and now, they're piles of dust. so what does it all matter?

you're right to be nihilistic. nothing matters. we're tiny ants crawling around a tiny rock zipping through a cold, empty, dark space. our planet is smaller than a grain of sand, smaller than an atom. what difference does any of this make?

so it's probably best to accept that fact and LIVE!! :)  whatever you do, good or bad or in between, nothing matters and nobody will ever care or remember it. not for long, anyway. so why not buck up and enjoy your meaningless little existence? laugh, dance, play, sing, have lots of sex, eat good food, enjoy the sunshine on your face, travel, smile when you feel like it, cry when you need to, love like crazy, and try not to WORRY. 

worry is the only useless emotion in human life.

*Hope that I will soon recover and back to work, so that I can  pretend that everything is still normal. Sometimes, I thought about  divorce but I love my daughter and don't want to hurt her, and I want to  provide the best of this world for her.* 

divorce the old lady?? why? just because she sometimes doesn't want to listen to you complain?! 

brother, if we all divorced our spouses because they didn't want to hear us complain, man...NONE of us would be married!!  :D

she doesn't always feel up to giving support and care. she's only human, man. don't you sometimes get sick of people's shit? don't you get tired of listening to her tedious complaints about things? of course you do--we all do in our marriages.

but we do it because our lives would be sadder, emptier, and grayer without them, even for all their human flaws and weaknesses.

look man, i don't want to preach about this or make assumptions. but are you like 24 years old? it's just a little odd that you haven't yet accepted that marriage is HARD. it's WORK. it's often annoying, frustrating, and completely unreasonable. but so is love, and that's why we accept it.

and tbh, nobody else is really ""better"" than anyone else. your next woman isn't going to be any better or different. she'd also get bored of complaints and annoying shit. and you'd feel the same about her sometimes. so why go through the headache and legal tangles of divorce?

in a few years you'd be right back where you are now, except all fucked up with alimony and child support and dealing with an ex. why do it?

marriage is teamwork, but it also requires what employers love to call ""self-motivation"". sometimes we have to be strongly independent and tough it out alone.

weird as it seems, being in a good marriage requires a lot of personal strength, because we can't expect or demand that our partners ALWAYS carry our burdens. we have to cultivate personal courage and realize that our partners also need help and relief.

sometimes we can best help others by not asking them for help.

besides, your kiddo needs both of you. try not to worry so much or overthink things, because these aren't actual ""problems"". 

if your wife was stealing your money to buy crack, or she was sneaking out and banging dudes three at a time for meth money, or was physically assaulting you or your child...then THOSE would be ""problems"".

but these little insignificant bumps in the road are nothing to get all bunged up about. dig in your heels, take some deep breaths, and laugh it up. things aren't as bad as they seem sometimes when we're feeling down, you know?

it's gonna be all good, man. get some rest and don't overthink things. pretty soon your old lady will do something and you'll feel all full of love again, and you'll be saying to yourself ""damn, i'm SO happy i didn't actually try to divorce her""  ;)   just like she probably thinks about YOU sometimes!! :D"
soc_1356998,socialskills,reddit_comment,223,"My husband is exactly like this and has told me his mind is usually blank. He only speaks when he has something to say and he doesn't enjoy small talk because of this. I think that it's okay to be like this and to accept that you aren't as social as the next person. Everyone is different. 
People constantly ask me if he ever talks, or if he hates them. Sometimes they make fun. But little do they know how intelligent and funny he is and how well he tells stories when it's just us or a few select people in our lives. And those of us he can hold a conversation with feel pretty special. 
You don't have to try to be someone you're not. There are people out there that will still be friends with you or want to hang out with you even if you're a quiet person. When I first met him, I was so intrigued because most people never stop talking. He was mysterious and it was fun getting to know him. I'm still getting to know him. I absolutely adore him. 
But that’s just us. If it makes you unhappy or affects your day-to-day life, there are many resources out there to work on social skills. Such as a life coach/confidence coach.

If that's the case, simply ask she lower her voice because it's a private matter you don't feel comfortable sharing with outsiders. Alternatively take her somewhere less populated so she can rant to her heart's content.

Ultimately though the fact she's opening up to you is a super positive thing and should be supported in this. You're providing her a valuable outlet and helping her work thru things just by listening. Don't stop that, don't change it at all. It's the only way she'll get thru it and come out healthier than her influences."

Eventually, I realized; who you are is a combination of your genes, your experiences, and your experiences effects on those genes.  If your baseline temperament is harmful to people, it's important to be aware of what you're doing and try to moderate that, but fundamentally, who you are doesn't change.  It took me the longest time to realize, I'm not compatible with everyone, and **THAT'S OK**.  Neither of are in the wrong, we're just not meant to be with each other.

If there is no gay bar, check local LGBT+ events or event coordinators and reach out to them. Volunteer with those same communities because banding together over a shared identity is SO IMPORTANT.

I know you will overcome this because gender expression is not limited to one stereotype. I remember in high school that one male student who was obviously gay would always hang out with girls, and girls would always hang out with him. YOU ARE NOT ALONE!!!! 

I feel so confident you’ll have guy friends soon, but especially in the gay community I am not surprised you have had that fear as many of us girls have noticed not all gay men hang out with each other and usually are found hanging with girls. 

Trust me, someone’s gonna go up to you at that gay bar/event and ask who you are, etc, and they will be so supportive of what you’ve been through.

soc_1166142,socialskills,reddit_comment,253,"It can definitely a good idea to show you're interested by saying some things you know about their interests, but even more potent is removing yourself from the equation and giving the reigns to them with an open ended question, like ""what do you think about life in puerto rico vs the mainland or [current state]"", and asking followup question about topics they bring up like ""do you think statehood would help bring resources to fix the lack of interest by the federal government?"" it really gives a sense that you're interested in what they have to say and gives them a chance to open up and control the conversation. Ofc you'd like to talk about your opinions and experiences, so maybe when they finish a point or you can interject depending on the conversation style and say something about yourself, but of course its a balancing act between expressing yourself and letting them express themselves, and bc you're not entirely controlling the situation, sometimes the conversation goes in a direction where you don't get to say something your really wanted to talk about and you have to decide if you want to force a pivot in the conversation to get to say what you want, or let it go, which can be difficult at first, but gets easier with practice.

I’m 36 (37 on Halloween) and my parents were such religious zealots they wouldn’t let me celebrate Halloween like normal kids. I wanted to go to Fright Feat at 6 Flags and instead I got stuck with Boo at the Zoo…it was humiliating. I never had a lot of friends growing up because of my parents and I was social lot awkward.

Several years ago I ditched an entire friend group because I felt like I was being used by them. I was suspicious until my suspicions were confirmed on my wedding day. My husband and I didn’t have a traditional wedding with groomsmen and bridesmaids so we just had our friends with us. I paid for all of them to be picked up in a stretch Hummer, where one of them didn’t show up and we had to go get him at his house because he was hungover. We paid for a huge hotel room for everyone to party in pre wedding with all the food and drinks they could have wanted. We paid to have all the girls makeup and hair done and have all the guys hair trimmed and beards trimmed and styled, there were 5 girls and 6 guys. By the time the wedding was over it was obvious not a single one had gotten us a gift. All our friends have pretty good jobs where they make plenty of money, but not a single one could cough up a $20 gift card. It was, and still is incredibly painful. I couldn’t have cared less about the amount, it’s that they felt so entitled to everything we did for them and not once did they look at that day as a day about my husband and I. After our honeymoon and a long discussion, they had done other things before this that made us uncomfortable like always expecting me to cook anytime we were together (I use to be a chef before I had back surgery. I still enjoy cooking for family and friends. It was that they had this unspoken expectation we would bring food for me to cook anytime we got together to hang out. They never offered to help me cook or offered to provide food to cook, the burden was always placed on us. They would also drink all our beer/ and or cider. We always bought stuff we liked that was a little on the pricey side because we don’t drink a lot and knew we could make a 6 pack work between just the two of us. We would constantly find someone had taken one of ours without asking. So there was a history of feeling used. We brought it up several times asking them to drink what they brought or if they wanted food they needed to provide it and or help out with the cost, and at the very least help me out in the kitchen. All our pleas and suggestions fell on deaf ears. Eventually we decided we would rather be alone than have friends that just used us. There’s times I miss their companionship and miss always having someone to hang out with, but I don’t miss them exactly. 

That’s all to say OP, you don’t need friends who are selfish or overlook your needs. Friendship should be a reciprocal relationship, where both people are better by the relationship with the other friend. Don’t settled for shitty friends just so you don’t have to feel alone, because there are worse things that being alone. 

You will make friends who respect you and reciprocate your kindness. These might be friends you keep during school or even beyond, but don’t sell yourself short and settle for friends out of loneliness.

It's easier to shoot from the hip now.  When somebody looks at me,  I reflexively smile rather than look at them and dart my eyes away(creep alert).  Now I smile and look away.  It now leaves the impression that I'm not a threat to the atmosphere and perhaps later that person can come up to me and ask for some kind of favor. When I walk into a room I scan it while walking a tad slower.  I let it be known to anybody I happen to lock eyes with that I'm a good guy with a simple nod and/or smile. We're all strangers but we all want to still feel safe.  Non verbal cues are huge in conversation. 

I don't try and force the compliments.  I pick up on how the other person is behaving.  If they seem receptive then I slide them a gem to brighten their day. Like I said,  I am a man with rbf.  Angry, stern, manly men should never take interest in fashion and colors and complimenting others!!!  .......it's what I like.  When I took the plunge to dress up and show that I care,  I came out of that closet.  I like dressing up and I don't care who gives a f""ck!!! It's good that you care.  By looking at clothing on a person you immediately give them head canon.  Business suit? Business man, duh. Torn dirty,  scraggly hair? Hipster. By us dressing tf up,  we immediately raise up in the perceived ranks.  We have put our best foot forward and when someone looks at you, they can tell. They don't know who you really are,  they're just hoping you fit the profile you've projected. 

It sounds like you despise the ""pretty privilege"". Probably because of social media and dumb pretty people getting clout without actually achieving anything.  I've held a similar belief so I think I understand.  Life, huh.  I could be going out on a limb and being wrong but I don't think looks are the majority of women's #1 priority when finding a man. Depends on what her intentions are... I'd like to live where you are where all these girls are being complimented in person. They must be foooiine! Kidding aside,  if you compliment the pretty ones in person you'll probably walk away with your heart pounding.  That's like getting a peek at the raid boss and noping out of there.  You won't die though but you'll break into a sweat... Speaking from experience.  I actually asked if I can give her my phone number.  She politely declined and I gracefully took the rejection.  Best thing I've done for myself. Wish she'd said yes though :(.  This is before I started dressing well. I was blissfully ignorant. 

I find that the phrases I rehearse in my bedroom are the ones that come out in day to day life.  Practice saying ""good morning, afternoon, evening"", practice your reactions.  Terrible example of a person but Hitler was known to rehearse his speeches and look at what he achieved.  Holy shit he could've used that charisma for good and we'd be living in a completely different world! Those 30 different things?  Rehearse what you would've said. You'll be able to shoot from the hip. Btw, the development from where you are and from where I'm at isn't very far.  The more interactions you have the faster this will come to you.  I just so happen to work around(not necessarily with) the public. You and I seem a lot closer than you may think.  Your fashion sense is probably even better than mine.

The clothes are you. They are you! You put that outfit together.  You chose it because of the colors and how it makes you feel. You have a birthday suit and then you have a suit. They are an extension of yourself.  Accessories are exactly that! They are parts of your attire to express your quirkiness or whatever trait you want to present. Ties are excellent for showing that off. Don't let those compliments go unappreciated. Start appreciating the act of someone compelled enough to come up to you and tell you you look nice. You're the pretty person in their world.  They validated your effort. It's a fortunate byproduct :)

I'm just gonna throw this in here. I hum my favorite tunes in the store or outside in the plaza.  Not loudly but just enough to sound good.  It makes me feel comfortable in my own skin.  I hum melodies of songs so I know they're pleasant to hear.  Again,  I'd like to make a rapport with the surrounding strangers that I am safe.  Quirky, but safe.

soc_136874,socialskills,reddit_comment,848,"I have this problem and I also have the solution.

Many people are pretty mainstream with their actions, behaviors, beliefs. That is why it is called mainstream. However there are exceptional people who do NOT lie, cheat, steal, badmouth, etc. that is deemed as bad behavior by most people.

See the thing is that people talk about negative things because those are the things bothering them. So you get assholes who do bad things, people who do things and don't realize they are doing the things, and then the complainers of those things. So you get a lot of complaining and two groups that do those things. Then you get the exceptional group that doesn't really understand those groups of people. This exceptional group is not perfect, just exceptional at how little they commit societal offenses and how strong they are in their will and are not really sensitive to silly things like most of mainstream is.

So what you get is a sensitivity to garbage / negative mainstream behavior.

The thing though is that there are private and personal garbage. The folks that aren't bad have a lot of private garbage. We all have garbage though. Sure the private garbage people don't really make up as much garbage but it still is something worth considering.

At the end of things you find out that if you are to survive you must accept people as they are. We accept our odd and shitty family even though they are odd and shitty. As long as people are not super terrible we should be fine. We should also understand that the world is as it is and we can only change how we act and what we contribute to the world we live in.

If you don't want to be around people that suck then stay inside if you wish. I have learned to take people's goodness with their fallibility. It is a hard pill to swallow because some people try to excel at becoming a less terrible person and have passion or doing positive things. Even so to do well we must take the negative with the positive. Try to assume that they are doing their best and then do your best when you know they are asshats.

It doesn't make any logical sense to let insanity to persist except for if you put up confrontation you end up adding friction and sometimes our own suffering and life is more important to mitigate then to mitigate the perpetuation of terrible mainstream behaviors we do not like.

When a mess is irritating but to clean it up would be more irritating, we let it slide in favor of not becoming more upset.

Kids are going to be messy. Old people are going to drive badly. Politicians are going to do dumb things on TV. Movie stars are going to act like adults that have more flexibility because they actually do. People will die. Theists will say things that Atheists don't like and Atheists will say things Theists don't like. Traffic will be higher during the day when people are awake. Water is wet. Sand gets everywhere. Life is what it is and often times we just have to accept those things in order to get to see what others see in people. Look past the shit on their face and see who they are.

I'm a stickler for in depth logic and it makes life hard to not stress about. I get mad at people not walking right in the store or how politicians are just trying to make money and don't give a crap about people and such but at the end of the day I only hold so much power. Why should I not hang around with someone just because they boast a little too much when I get more entertainment out of their stories or playing video games. Unless someone has done something very bad, should we dismiss those people?

I dismiss those that hurt others knowingly and will not abstain from such actions. If they are for themselves and only themselves and will walk on others I will not stand for that. So they aren't good with money, is that my problem? Only if they hurt the relationship with their bad money habits such as getting me robbed or kidnapped or what not. 

Grace is I think I am trying to talk about. We must have grace. We are not infallible. Perhaps less fallible at many things comparatively to those we feel frustrated by and want to isolate from but definitely not fallible. I don't like the country I am in but it is a better option than other places so I live here still. I take what good I can from the situation. I find the silver lining. Unless there is a fatal element, then don't worry and just push through. Life is short and frustrating. How frustrating is really up to you and how you decide to react to people and situations.

It took me a long time to figure this out. 2 decades.

soc_244117,socialskills,reddit_comment,262,"1. You have this Gorgeous smart, funny chick who is totally into you. Even if you can't see it, there are definitely some awesome qualities about yourself. Remember that. 

2. Train your brain to be more self confident. Every day, write down 5 things about yourself that you can appreciate. ""I saved a kitten when I was 10, that was pretty nice of me"" ""I know a lot about Physics, I guess I'm pretty intelligent"" ""I lost 5 pounds since last week, not too shabby"" ""I said hello to this homeless dude yesterday when everyone else ignored him. That's kind of me."" 

3. If you can, meditate. By meditating you become more self aware of all your actions and after a while when you're about to say something like ""I'm such a wiener, why do you even like me?"" You'll be able to stop yourself and think ""Wait. Saying this won't make me or her feel good, so I'm not gonna say this"" 

4. If you can't do it for yourself, do it for her. She really digs you and by taking a jab at yourself, it's like taking a jab at her. It's like  you really like Star Wars or something and then someone comes up and is like ""Well Star Wars isn't even that great - George Lucas is a dick.""

5. You worrying about fucking it up is almost as bad as it being fucked up. Might as well enjoy the moments you have with her now. Nobody became a millionaire by thinking about how they might become homeless. "
soc_1323147,socialskills,reddit_comment,165,"Man, my heart goes out to you a little bit. I've been where you are now. It sounds like you don't know your own worth, and that's causing self-esteem issues. Going through that was hard for me, because it meant I had a lot of deep stuff that was bothering me that I needed to talk about, but couldn't. I struggled to connect with people on a casual, banter level which made it impossible to initiate those conversations. 

Truth is you can only talk about the deeper stuff, sharing feelings, emotional support, as well as more profound subjects, with certain people. People you trust with whom you have common interests. You are going to talk to a lot of people in your life, and it's up to you to filter through them to see who you feel comfortable with, who makes you laugh, and most of all, who is kind. One word of advice, don't judge people by their cover. Get to know them first."
soc_850844,socialskills,reddit_comment,636,"I'm gonna give a more extreme example, something that I went through. Hopefully you can take something from it.

I got involved with a really good friend of mine at a time where she needed a friend. She became the first person I ever actually loved, but she was also really toxic. I sacrificed too much of my own mental strength for her. I didn't see any of the red flags because I thought that she needed me, that I needed to be strong for her, and that this is only temporary until she can find her own strength again. There were a good number of times where I could have walked away. We would say we would only be friends, but I was naive. Sometimes when we would say we should only be friends, she would flip it on me asking me why I'm giving up so easily, saying that if my feelings were real I would keep trying. I remember that she would tell me that her mind isn't always set in stone and maybe things could change in the future, and I thought that I had to prove to her that I was the one for her, because I cared about her more than these other guys did. There's a lot more, but it ended with me broken and thinking that I wasn't enough.

But that's the thing, OP. If I knew what I know now, the minute I saw the red flags, I would have bounced. I'm a completely stronger person because of the journey, and I AM glad that I went through it, but it was also a terrible fucking journey. I would not be who I am today if I hadn't gone through it, seen how fucking low I could fall, and pushed my own resilience to know how far I would go for love.

If you know that she isn't good for you, listen to yourself. Think about how much you're constantly thinking about your situation. Think about how much of your day is taken from you thinking about scenarios in which maybe things could work, or that you're wondering how she thinks about you. Think about how much of these thoughts consume you. All of that time you spend thinking about it robs you of your present self, which ultimately takes time away from investing in your own future goals.

If you want to get over her and your situation, you need to really know yourself. Think about all of what you have going for you right now: your academic goals, your goals for your career, the time you need to complete your daily work, maybe your gym time, maybe your time spent with friends, or time spent trying to learn your craft.

You said that you know she isn't good for you, but do you know YOURSELF enough to know whether you'll let your emotions drive you? If you keep her around, know that this leaves ground for something to happen between you both. Sometimes we have a clearer head, and when we say, ""No, this isn't good for me,"" we really mean it, and we know how to set boundaries.

But like I said, sometimes our emotions will drive us, and we'll allow anything to happen given the opportunity, despite the red flags, especially if it already consumes you. There are two roads, and at the end of the day, you are going to choose the road you really want to take, because our emotions can force our actions. And if that's where you're swaying, ask yourself if that's even worth it. If you even have time for that. As we get older, we don't have time for that anymore. There is sacrifice on both roads, but you need to decide which road is worth taking."
soc_1477544,socialskills,reddit_comment,793,"Hi there! No worries, I also needed a good nap today)))
I'll be glad to clarify myself. Thank you for asking. 

&gt;
You mentioned that people's upbringing is not set in stone. I thought that we couldn't change the past of how we're brought up so I'm not quite understanding what you're meaning by that. Can you explain please?

- yes, of course.  For example, manners could be easily improved and very often it should! Just because someone grew up in a rude environment doesn't mean they're destined to be rude to others. With good example to follow and seeing the difference it makes in communication and relationships, it's wise to take that into account.

Being kind and polite doesn't cost us anything and goes a long way. 


&gt;Are you describing what my friend said to me in the last paragraph that I wrote as a power move? If so, I can see what you mean. If it is something that they don't wish for me to talk about I wish they would just say so instead of playing power games. Another one that I feel is a power game that happened last night that I felt was dismissive was me explaining the logic behind why I did something and this person chiming in that ""well that has never happened to me."" I mentioned that I was glad it never happened to her but this was my experience and what I did to work around it. Someone else backed her up suggesting that I wasn't doing something right. I'm just not responding in thay group for a while. All this to say, they and people in the past love to say one thing but to me proves my point that people don't always tell you what they are thinking but will always show you. 

&gt;That being said, this is a text group so the same online rules may apply? 

- yes, the ending of your post stood out to me. 

The people in the group I was in would actually ask others to guess and welcome any intuitive thoughts or feelings you pick up from their photograph or a post. The problem is they seldom provide you any feedback back (and if they do, it's feedback to their friends mostly. Kinda like in school people form mini groups and support each other by giving them what they expect) so there is really not much there to learn about your intuition.... unless you are skilled yourself enough to understand these things and continue observing what happens. 

I've actually picked up quite a bit from those groups. Including a few power moves I needed myself. Mostly for explaining my boundaries and verbalizing my emotions a little bit better. 

Besides, do you honestly think people are going to tell what's  truly on their minds? Not many can do that. And some of the thought processes I've read - not pretty. Ugly actually.... which than reflects in those people's life also, unfortunately.

Sigmund Freud studied people's dreams all his life, does anyone know Sigmund's dreams? Haha 

Mindfulness is a big thing today.  How easy is it to catch all your thoughts and deliberately think only certain thoughts? It is very likely to be off about someone else's thoughts, yes.... but as you noticed, they will always show you.

&gt;To ignore that or think that you are seeing something ""wrong"", something that is not there yet it is right in front of you - this potentially could drive you crazy.

&gt;I'm quite confused by this? Can you explain more please? This had me in a thought circle.

- well, you just had a situation where two people said that ""that has never happened to them"". Yet it happened to you, right? 

I typically don't have patience for this kind of scenarios. Unfortunately I've been caught up in explaining myself and it wasn't productive. I know what happens to me, i know what i see, hear, read etc. I also know what is a product of my imagination. Explaining myself to someone who is already in huge resistance to my experience could be very energy draining. I am not there to change someone's mind or logic, because I know it's harder to change my own. 

If you think about it... people accept what they logically understand, what matches our level of thinking. Their thought process is not the same as your thought process. And that's okay, everyone is different. What's more important is values. If you have similar or matching values with people you' re talking to, it's much easier to understand each other. 

Btw if you know you are doing the right thing, do you really need strangers to confirm it? Ask those who already know you well))"
soc_927487,socialskills,reddit_comment,461,"&gt; It sounds a lot to me as though the pool of people you're trying to befriend is too narrow,

I'd posit I have the opposite problem, meaning I have too broad a pool that I befriend. So your second assumption was correct. I talk to people with all different humors, social status, backgrounds, hobbies, interests, etc. To give you a microcosm, I talk to an *actual* incel in first period and by seventh period I chill with a body-building wrestler with his girlfriend straddled next to him the whole time.

&gt;or too different from you, or your interest in other things and people itself is too narrow. 

I acknowledge much of it may come from my own close-mindedness. However, I have no interest not because I want to avoid things I don't like, but because I've spent my entire life being exposed to things I was never comfortable with and trying to appease people who were comfortable with them. (This wording is a little wonky so please tell me if this doesn't make sense, I'll be happy to rephrase.)

For example, I participated in team sports such as baseball and soccer, but the more I did it, the less I enjoyed it. I did both for around five years to make my parents proud. I've always been fit, but I've never been athletic, and the more I tried to get to know people who were athletic on the team, I felt like I was being someone other than myself. How can I open myself up to something that makes me feel uncomfortable, or in some cases, inadequate?

&gt; Judging by your apparent anxiety about losing your virginity and that a ""significant majority"" of people your age have already had sex (or at least claimed they have), I'm going to assume you're young and probably in your teens.  If that's the case, (correct me if I'm wrong) your social pool is going to be quite small but will expand once you leave, or begin seeking out individuals or communities with whom you may have more in common. 

Correct on the first part, I'm seventeen years old right now. However, I actually do seek out others who have the same interests as me. For example, I regularly attend a history club because I enjoy history. However, it's our personalities that don't really mix. It's a pity, whenever our personalities mix, we have opposite interests, and whenever our interests mix, we have opposite personalities.

&gt;Just my two cents but I'll offer this: Fixating too much on the end goal we have in mind can make us neglect the basic steps required to get there.

I'll keep this in mind. Thank you for reading (if you didn't I understand, it's a very long comment.)"

I'm sure you'll meet a partner eventually. 18 yrs old is a very young age. Loosing virginity or getting a GF or BF before a certain age is just meaningless social/peer pressure.

soc_244628,socialskills,reddit_comment,334,"While I don't necessarily agree with /u/reymont12, the drinking bit is quite clearly correct. Using a substance as a crutch is definitely not good for you, and can lead to being very bad for you in the long run.

As for the situation itself, not playing devil's advocate but I think you are not being fair. Their actions (the girl and your friends') are shitty, yes. But you should (you may already have) questioned where it comes from.

People rarely want to accept that others' reactions are engineered by the perception we give them. Do they know you actually care about her? Does she? Are they aware that you feel betrayed by her? This is one of the things many introverts don't know. People cannot read your mind, and intentions that seem obvious to you may not be to others.

I'm not blaming you, but if you use a little perspective, their shitty actions can have a context you overlooked. That being said, they clearly shouldn't treat you like that, and you should confront both your friends and the girl. Sober. 

You also need to find the cause for your introversion. Insecurity, being judgmental, low self-esteem, etc. You clearly want to be extroverted because of your behavior on alcohol, but you need to fix the cause of the issue instead of taking a desensitizer to bypass it.

Why are your friends being dicks? It sounds like their image of you is the fun drunk guy. If that is the case, it's hardly surprising they treat her actions with jokes. Why did she think you are weird/distant? Flirting and the like are nice, but it doesn't sound like you actually have expressed real affection or interest. Maybe you're just a casual thing in her eyes.

I hope you start living a healthier life-style because alcohol doesn't seem to hurt when you are 21 but when it catches up to you it's a mess. Good luck and have a glass of grapefruit juice for the hangover."

However, if you want to write them off that's your choice, I ain't judging you. 

As for how to deal with someone hogging all the social space, you can take what they are saying, connect/relate it to your own story and then respond to them in like. Respond with your story, they will respond with theirs and so on so forth. If they really are a narc then they will confront YOU and tell you that you don't listen to them. But most likely they won't notice it themselves and you can both come off winners.

#2 Say whatever and exactly what is on your mind at that time in moment. As long as you're not being rude or insensitive, you should be free to verbalize your thoughts and be as authentic as comfortably possible.

If you can get a girl to laugh even if you're being completely silly ( not saying jump in mud or shame yourself) but if she smiles or genuinely laughs think on your feet bc then you can ask questions like if she goes to school her age if she works. And BADABOOM table is turned and you get to judge if the person is a fit for you, if so awesome if not awesome now you have a potential friend and maybe something will change later in life ( don't be mean or a prick if the person isn't your type, if this is the case id recommend being extra nice but in a total friend zone way) 
Anyway if you dont learn from this experience you had it's just a waste of life so I hope you get something or learned something about yourself. Everyone is different"
soc_1713742,socialskills,reddit_comment,135,"What's the current situation she has to ""get over""?

She most likely likes you, but kissing is too fast for her right now. She is probably telling the truth. It's up to you if you want to wait in hopes she becomes ready (could take months) or move on emotionally. 

Sounds like she is keeping you in the ""maybe-zone"". It's not the friendzone, but it's not what you want either. So that's just it really, it's all a bunch of maybes right now. If you do decide to keep trying, DO NOT try to kiss her again right now. Back up and just be friends for now like she said.

If you feel like it's too risky, it might be time to move on. I'm not her, so I don't know, only you can decide."
soc_642312,socialskills,reddit_comment,379,"I used to have this problem.  It's really frustrating when your tolerance of this sort of behaviour is interpreted as ""it's okay to make fun of you because you don't get mad"" .  

I can't say that I know exactly how to solve your situation, but I would suggest a couple things.

You can try talking directly to people about it.  Tell them you don't like being made fun of and would like to be treated with more respect.  Sometimes though, people just think you're overreacting and taking everything too seriously.  They may not understand how you feel and might simply want to defend themselves.  It depends on the person, their ego and how well they empathize with others.

You can also try this: Don't laugh at or engage in any of the jokes being made at you.  Blatantly ignore them and move the conversation on to something else.  Maintain a level head and just get past it (even if it is pretty funny and coming from one of your close friends).  It won't feel like anything is changing at first, but friends should eventually notice.  This can be effective if you stay engaged in jokes that don't involve you or anyone else at the butt end of it.  Don't respond to jokes targeted at you, but try not to be a stick in the mud.

Another thing to try: Make some new friends.  Not saying you have to get rid of your current friends, but you'll find that not everyone is interested in making you the joke (or anyone for that matter).  It feels really nice to hangout with people for an entire night and not once be made fun of.  Find people who genuinely want to enjoy your company.

Lastly, don't become the ""class clown"" .  Don't just take it.  Don't resort to laughing at the jokes and pretending it's fine.  Start expecting people to treat you with the respect you give them and don't settle for anything less.  On the same token, don't take things too seriously though.  Life is too short.  Just try to guide yourself into the most positive situation you can while you're here.

I hope some of this is helpful.  If not, I hope you find a method that works for you!"
soc_784671,socialskills,reddit_comment,108,"Seems no one gets what you're trying to say.

Lol. You totally missed the analogy. My analogy involved someone who WANTS to run the marathon. Yet complains about having to START running.  He is not yet a runner...and hasnt tried being a runner.

Your rebuttal assumes he has run many marathons...didn't get anything out of it, I.e., he is already a runner.

Totally different situation.

Like i said, If you don't want to change, that's your choice. Just be aware and ok with the consequences. No one is going to be interested in you if your not interested in them. That's pretty simple unless you're suffering from solipsism."
soc_1500657,socialskills,reddit_comment,149,"You're inexperienced and this situation brought you a bunch of new feelings, which is completely normal. The more experiences you have the more vulgar it will become and less you will overthink a possibly random kiss. Assuming she has more experience, there's nothing between the two of you nor second intentions, for her it might have been just that, a random kiss with no meaning. Telling her how you feel might scare her off because you may come off too intense too soon. Maybe try seeing if she wants to hang out, try to get closer and then see how things hit off. There's some level of attraction I'm sure, otherwise the kiss probably wouldn't have happened. 

This is obviously just my opinion, and telling her how you feel might be the right option. But honestly I think that it's too soon and you're going to scare her off."

She can spend time with her family on her own time, and if you don't want to spend time with her family in a shared space, that's your choice.

Perhaps a review of expectations is a good approach.  Let her know that there will be family friendly travel, and there will be friends only travel.  She will be able to choose which ones she attends, but the family isn't invited to friends only outings.

Best plan would be to pre-plan which excursions and travel are going to be family friendly, and which ones are going to be friends only."

soc_462177,socialskills,reddit_comment,652,"I know exactly how this feels. I've been struggling with the same thing for a while, but I've recently realized something absolutely essential to my social success in these kinds of situations. I can *daydream* about myself talking to her, and then just go home and daydream about what talking to her would have been like, or I can *be* the man that walks up and talks to her. No one's gonna be that guy for me. As uncomfortable as it is (and it can REALLY get my heart pumping), *I* have to be him, otherwise it won't happen. Period. 

Sitting around and thinking about something I wish I would have done accomplishes even less than doing nothing, because when I dwell on my inaction, it makes me feel remorse about something that *didn't even happen*. What kind of person would do that to themselves? Well, me. I have been for a long time, and I'm tired of reliving that cycle because all it does is make me feel like crap. I certainly don't ""get the girl"" with this method. There are a lot of things in this world that only YOU can do for yourself, and unfortunately, being the guy that walks up to the pretty girl from class and strikes up a conversation with her is one of them. That guy you see in your daydreams talking to the girl? That's you! Being that guy is simple, but not easy. You have to force yourself to do it.

And I'll level with you, there are times when I fucking hate it. Being vulnerable sucks, plain and simple. But I'm at the point where I want to connect with people so badly that it has finally begun to outweigh the discomfort that putting myself in a position of vulnerability has always caused me. That doesn't mean that being vulnerable in a social situation is any less uncomfortable. Just that I want to connect with people badly enough to overcome the hurdle of shyness.

It still kind of sucks, but it's been getting marginally easier the more I do it. And it's not without its rewards. 

1) Doing this helps you grow your confidence. Exposing yourself to your fear is the quickest way to overcome it, and, speaking from experience, feeling like the guy that's ""afraid to talk to girls"" is a really miserable place to find yourself.

2) You're ACTUALLY talking to her and not just daydreaming about it. Who knew you could do it? Well, you did. You were just too afraid to be the guy from your daydreams.

3) This method gives you an ACTUAL chance at forming a connection with another person instead of just living inside of your head.

Now, could you get rejected? Sure. Could you be awkward and uncomfortable? Sure. What if she thinks you're weird? Or she doesn't like you? Or there's something hanging out of your nose? All occupational hazards, my friend. It comes with the territory. But by actually facing your fear, and here's the best part, you won't regret *not* doing it. You won't sit and stew on what might have been or kick yourself for not having the guts to just talk to her. And again, this part feels *amazing*. When I have an awkward encounter with someone, I don't dwell on it for hours and days and weeks playing out all the different scenarios, because there was only the one scenario, the one that happened in REALITY. Having an actual exchange with someone gives you the closure that a daydream NEVER will.

TLDR; The biggest piece of advice I can give you is to try to be brave, because no one is going to talk to her for you. The cold approach can be very scary, but it gets easier if you're willing to practice. The question I'll leave up to you to ask yourself is ""Am I willing?"""
soc_1198982,socialskills,reddit_comment,143,"aaaa, i feel really bad for saying this but sometimes i’m really shy when i meet new/certain people (idk why my brain is like this, i just get intimidated sometimes) and end up acting really awkward/distant towards them, which just confuses them (even tho i don’t actually dislike them) and i hate it tbh. having an rbf doesn’t help either haha. 

i’m trying to work on this bc ik that if someone did this to me and i didn’t know the reason, it would hurt. i still think that you should tell your friend bc if your friend brings it up to that girl, she might try to fix things. this might not be the reason (she could just be a childish bitch) but that’s just my two cents :) hope you have a great trip regardless of what happens! &lt;3

soc_1579256,socialskills,reddit_comment,149,"The best advice I can give you might be the hardest to accomplish. So much easier said than done. 

Let it go. 

Words are like arrows. Once you shoot them, you can’t take them back. You can apologize for shooting someone or saying something, but you can’t take them back, make it like it didn’t happen. 

Remember that you can’t control what people say, only how you respond to them. This might make you more hesitant in responding, but being thoughtful before is better than over analyzing after, I think. 

You can send someone a strong invitation for offense but whether that person receives the invitation and “take” offense (take being the keyword here) is up to them. 

In the same way, you too, can choose to take offense, or you can choose to laugh it off, deflect, change the subject, etc. 

It’s up to you. 

Good luck op"
soc_1027667,socialskills,reddit_comment,278,"First ask yourself if you really want friends. Do you have emotional barriers to building friendships? Are there people who you may have overlooked who could count as a friend already? It may be worth discussing your concerns with them and formalizing the friendship.

You have listed a bunch of barriers to developing friendships, so I assume that you have seriously thought about your situation, and that you are willing to consider taking extra steps to develop a friendship.

It may be worth making a graph of your daily activity. This may help you realize that you have time to spare. Make special note that it is not unreasonable to restrict your social activity to accommodate your established activities. Conversely, it is also not unreasonable to schedule social time as an appointment in order to block other responsibilities from taking priority. That is all up to you, though.

If you think that your life is too chaotic, you are in luck. There are social options for people at every level. The most accessible way to make friends is texting. Do some poking around on reddit, and you will find several subs made just for making friends. There may even be dedicated chat groups available in subs that cover your favorite subjects!

Just say that your life is chaotic and you'd like to find someone to chat with when you can. More specifics should be discussed in private chat. Don't be afraid to mention the tone that you'd prefer to have, for instance, do you want a supportive person, or a lighthearted chat, or something else? Don't be too disappointed if people disappear, they do that, just keep connecting."
soc_77524,socialskills,reddit_comment,529,"I'm guessing you work at a tech startup? There's absolutely no reason to be working those hours unless you have a shit ton to gain or are getting paid $250K+ (and if you are, you're probably at an established consulting company or somethin') If you're really as critical as you say you are, it seems that they should be treating you much better than they are. As you said, your company would be buried, but if your reason for leaving would be because your business partner pressured you into working so much that it led to the crumbling of your marriage, I'm pretty sure it'd be his fault.

Apologies if I'm totally wrong. I just left my startup and I felt the same way about my social life and work hours. In the end, I recognized my self-worth, my co-founder's inability to steer us to the promised land, and realized I'd rather get a 9-5 for a few years and come back to starting a business when I can be in charge. You have to have to be willing to step away.

I'd say you just need more time. How you get it is up to you. I think I'm funny, charming, interesting, intelligent, and I hear that from a lot of people. However, when I was at my company and all I would do was work, I had no time to really fill my head with interesting things. To have conversations with people, you have to be able to relate to them and have experienced you can drop in conversation to get the ball rolling. So when someone has time to join dancing classes, go drinking every weekend, and visit other countries, if that person isn't a huge douche, they'd probably be pretty interesting conversation.

You're probably a pretty smart guy but all of your intellectual capacity is laser focused on one thing: your business. By not having time, you don't get to use your head to make a clever Breaking Bad reference or sweet talk a girl in a foreign language.

You should subscribe to /r/seduction for one. It gets flak for being manipulative, but what you really get from there is the psychology of self-improvement and being interesting. I think you'll enjoy reading this post (actually, shit, it's from /r/askmen)

In closing, when it comes to time, it's a tough thing. If you're getting a business off the ground, you can't get around the time commitment. It has been said that Mark Cuban didn't take a day off for 6-7 years. I worked in the tech industry however and there are distinct phases you go through where you know if you just need to work more or if you're in ""slow death"" mode. I'm not sure what you do, but if you have been really miserable for 10 years and a lot of this has to do with this company, I'd evaluate where you stand (again, I apologize if I'm totally off the mark, for some reason I just imagine you being a really good programmer that is potentially being exploited by a non-technical but totally salesman-y business type - but that's just my experience)"
soc_1609759,socialskills,reddit_comment,871,"Good answer but here's some things you should consider: 

1. Love ain't going to motivate you.

Ever heard the saying that happy people often gain weight together? Love ain't gonna motivate you to change and if anything, you'll just get distracted and be less likely to make big life changes. I've been there - finding motivation is hard and when you're dating someone you're into, it's even harder to man up and focus on something less ""fun"" like figuring out WTF to do with your life. 

2. Not only is it unlikely that you'll find motivation, but it's more likely that you'll bring her down with you.

Are you sure you won't be using her youth and potential for the future to fuel what you want for yourself? Are you hoping her optimism and motivation is going to rub off on you somehow? It's usually the opposite - negative people/people who lack motivation tend to bring people down around them. Your lack of motivation is going to rub off on her at a time when she has her whole future ahead of her. Even if you don't tell her that this is what you're hoping from this relationship, she'll care about you and worry about you and that's a hell of a lot of pressure to put on an 18 year old just stating out on her own. 


Take a look at it from her perspective - it's a nightmare to care about someone who isn't motivated especially when you're a teen and still finding yourself : 
https://madamenoire.com/782622/trouble-dating-someone-less-ambitious/


&gt; The more you push your boyfriend toward what you think he should be doing with his life, the more stress you create in your relationship. 

&gt; Think about it this way: What was the last thing you tried to change about yourself? I bet it wasn’t easy; personal change is rarely swift and simple. There are probably lots of things you want to change about yourself, but you can’t or won’t or don’t know how. Change takes time, effort, perseverence, and motivation. It also requires emotional, spiritual, and intellectual energy – and you have to really want to change.

&gt; If it’s that hard to change yourself when you’re motivated and want to change, think how hard it would be to change your unmotivated, unambitious boyfriend! Impossible. Maybe you’ll motivate him to get a job, but you won’t change the fundamental aspect of his personality or character that makes him lack ambition or motivation for future.

&gt; You can’t change your boyfriend. You have enough on your hands with your own life! You have your path, goals, plans, hopes and dreams. Focus your energy and attention on your own journey, and allow your boyfriend to walk his own path. 

&gt; 2. Be aware of how incompatible or opposite life goals affect relationships
One of the most important parts of a successful, healthy, happy long-term relationship is compatible life goals. You and you boyfriend need to be on the same page with regard to careers, kids, location, and plans for the future. If you have ambitious dreams and goals but your boyfriend just wants to live a quiet boring life, then yes, your boyfriend will drag you down.

&gt; And, you need to remember that your boyfriend’s values, opinions, and character traits will rub off on you. That’s why it’s incredibly important to know who you are and where you intend to go, and not let a relationship stop you from living life fully. Don’t let your boyfriend’s lack of ambition change the trajectory of your life! One day, you’ll regret it.

&gt; 4. Refuse to absorb your boyfriend’s traits
You are the sum of the five people you spend the most time with. If I stayed with my boyfriend who had vague dreams but no specific plans to achieve them, I believe I would’ve sunk low. I wouldn’t have achieved half the things I did – because we absorb the traits and values of the people we spend  the most time with.

&gt; Will your boyfriend will drag you down because he’s not ambitious, or will he be your strongest supporter? Many successful men are married to women who aren’t ambitious in their own right, and yet the men are wildly wealthy and powerful. Being attached to a partner who isn’t ambitious doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be held back…but your boyfriend’s lack of ambition will affect on you. What will that effect be? It depends on you and how determined you are to achieve your own goals and plans for your life.

Tldr: I'm sorry, this isn't what you want to hear. Love sounds fun and like the movies, something that should transform your whole life, right? No. You have to do the hard work on yourself and fix your own shit before bringing someone else, especially someone this young, into your hot mess. Get counseling, find a job abroad and live a little, find yourself, find what makes like exciting and awesome and who you are/what you want to do in life and THEN you're ready to find a partner for the ride. Love ain't a shortcut for something like this - you gotta do the hard work on your own."

At the end of the day, however you feel, is your choice. 

Once I realised this, it helped me to let go of a lot of shit. 90% of the time people are thinking about their own dramas, their own lives. If they think about you, it’s probably going to be fleeting. If anyone spends a lot of time thinking about you/talking about you, take it as a compliment. Because either way you are taking up space in their head. Good or bad, they are the ones choosing to think about you, choosing to react about you, and choosing to use their time on this planet to give a fuck about you. Most people won’t, and that’s okay.

I've been doing this for the last couple of years since year 10 and it's been nothing but good for me. But that's just my opinion, I'm not here to try to influence you in any way shape or form.

soc_1054635,socialskills,reddit_comment,348,"I personally don't message my friends a lot because I don't have much interest in digital relationships. When we meet up it's like no time passed at all though, so I feel like the luxury of instant and continuous communication being the new standard of good friendship is... bad. That sounds like such a boomer thing to say, but it's a widespread idea that social media isn't good for your mental health at worst and is a poor way of communicating at best, and it's not true that you need it or you'll have no life, in my experience.

Anyway, that's a whole other thing to some of the best advice I've seen here in other comments, which point out your role. If I were to take some extreme ownership of a perceived degradation in my relationships I would have to put in a lot of effort and force myself to not entertain the idea that I'm being let down by my friends, that THEY'RE not treating me like I deserve, that THEY need to do more. If you maintain the mindset that everything that brought you to your current position is your fault, is up to you, then you will find out really quickly what you need to change in yourself to change the situation. You'll find you are in control, and when you run into the point where you think ""I've done my part"" just ignore that thought and keep pushing through with the assumption you haven't. Asking others for advice is already a good step, because introspection is hard, so good job.

Inb4 that's a good way to have bad people use you, the goal is to be friends with people here, and that isn't at any cost because the assumption is they're people worth being friends with. You'll know if they're that kind of person right now and probably not want to be friends with them. You'll know why you want to put the effort in, and if you only want them around to make you feel good then you're the one using them."
soc_1426058,socialskills,reddit_comment,290,"It boils down to how well you genuinely connect with people.

**You need to be confident and have positive vibes**. If your vibes and energy are not positive for the most part, people will avoid you. Nobody likes that person who is/appears boring, angry, frustrated, and/or depressed all the time. Furthermore, nobody especially likes that excessively needy/clingy/thirsty/desperate and approval-seeking person. Your positive mindset is everything.

**You need to connect with people on a deeper level**. This has to be done especially in person, not merely by texting. Don't do just polite small talk because that's simply boring. Go deeper. Make conversations purposeful, meaningful, and memorable. Exchange interests, opinions, hobbies, and all that. Talk about yourself, and get them talking about themselves !

**Take leadership and show courage.** Don't wait around for people to invite you. People will never tell you what to do. They want you to just do it. Invite them to your activities. Instead of texting, why don't you do actual Zoom calls with people ? People will appreciate you putting yourself out there.

**You need to provide value through your own services/expertise**. People love it when you provide tangible value into their lives; they will look up to you as somebody that is knowledgeable and wise and respect you for that. When people see value in you, they will invest in you.

**Lastly, have an abundance mindset.** You need to be genuinely busy in your life pursuing goals and hobbies while interacting with people on the side. Your social life is not going to improve in isolation; you need to level up in all areas of your life at the same time. You need to keep moving forward in your life and keep meeting/interacting with new people."
soc_351225,socialskills,reddit_comment,389,"1) Yes it's 100% okay to go on multiple dates. Just be clear to the girl you're hanging out with that you don't jump into dating until at least a month or 2 in. Because you got to get to know them. Nothing polygamous about it. 

2) I doubt girls focus on one guy at a time (Not all girls). Girls cheat just as much as guys. And I am sure they have gotten comments from many many men. Wait to see how these girls react to you in the long run that you do what you want, they should want to keep your attention. The app deleting/Talking to no one else is a sign they want you long term (REALLY good sign), but it's UP TO YOU in the end what you want to do. Don't get emotional about your choice or feel bad, especially if you haven't been on a date yet. 

If a girl is talking to you. That is enough of a sign that she's interested in dating you. Even sometimes when she's not talking to you it's a sign she could be interested. Some people like to get testy with you to see how you'll react, but you have to be firm and confident in your action making. (But if a girl tells you to back off. Then BACK OFF. Period.)

As well, Meeting people in real life like bars, clubs, social gatherings can be WAY WAY better if you have a few hours on the weekend and the confidence to talk to a lot of girls. I have actually gotten a couple dates from girls I've met at bus stops (Not straight up ""Lets date"" but more like ""Hi, What are you taking at university?"".) Which can be much more rewarding when you meet the right girl. Be open. 

As for online dating, It's hit or miss for me. Some girls will give a lot of feedback, some not as much. Just stay focused, text once in a while, have a good time, try to set up a date when there is availability. Send a girl a joke or a story. If she doesn't reply send her something else in a couple days. And then ask her out within the next 2 days after that. Online dating is a long term game sometimes. "

A hobby isn't something you hate doing, it's a passion. A passion that you can hide behind and use as a tool to create those connections.

Getting into social stuff is incredibly gruelling. It's essentially mining. You hit stone with a pickaxe hoping that that you can find that person of gold.

This advice is also on how to feel less shitty while doing it. If you can connect with people (like I seem to be failing to do with you) you'll get interesting interactions that shine through the discomfort. And you'll get more perspectives so you can connect even better with people until it's more exciting than shitty.

Don't like it? Fine. But you asked a question and I answered it. Not perfectly, but enough for you to have an idea and not have ""I don't know how"" as an excuse.

If you don't want to do that, that's your choice. I don't blame you- it's gruelling. It's gross and it feels more like an exercise in futility than work and it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

A lot of people have a ""voice"" in their head that judges them harshly. But that voice is not you. A common phrase in therapy is ""You are not your thoughts"". You cannot control those judging thoughts directly. But one thing that you can do is simply notice what that voice says, then let it go. It's up to you whether or not you want to believe it.

Another thing you can do is get curious. Ask yourself, ""Why do I feel that way?"". Keep asking ""why?"" until you get deep enough that either you discover something useful about yourself, or realize that your mindset is based on something silly and illogical."

I actually prefer making friends at work for the very reason that we are forced to work together for long periods of time. It gives me more time to bond. "
soc_911346,socialskills,reddit_comment,358,"I agree with you!

I feel that looking to skills, possessions, physical traits, achievements, or successes is a fragile way to establish your self-esteem.  It might work for some people.  Lots of self-help and affirmations focus on looking at one's strong points so this strategy must work to some extent.

However, I tried using affirmations to create a solid base of self-love and they failed me in that.  There is always someone more skilled, more physically apt, more successful.  Beauty is fleeting, possessions come and go and do not always come because we deserve them.  My perspective that I am ""kind"", or ""clever"" is just my opinion, not absolute fact.

What worked for me was reflecting on and truly experiencing the deeply empowering nature of the choice of love.  Choice, in general.  You and I, we are free to love anything in this world we desire.  I could walk outside, pick a rock off of the sidewalk, and decide that I was going to make that rock precious to me.  It doesn't ""deserve"" that, it doesn't have any talents or monetary value.

But there is nothing in this world that can take the ability to make that choice away from me.  You could drive a knife into my side and I still have the choice to love you if I want to.  To me, this recognition was overwhelmingly powerful.

Following that, for me, I found a deep well of self-love in reflecting on everything horrible about me.  I am sometimes very selfish.  I can abandon things with little qualm.  I am not a very good listener.  I am prone to making promises that I can't keep.  I am fickle, my passions change constantly.  I am inflexible.  I can't handle spur-of-the-moment changes.

And thinking on everything about me that anyone would be right to dislike - I exercised my sovereign power to decide that *I love me anyway*.  For me, focusing on everything good about me felt like running away from the things that were not good.  Rather than justify love with ""deserving"", I think it can be more effective to make the decision to love your least-worthy self."
soc_127314,socialskills,reddit_comment,372,"Are you a guy or girl? What kind of stuff do you plan with your new friends? Is it stuff that they want to do or stuff that you want to do? Do you call them or txt them constantly? 

Im on your boat too. I'm currently  learning how to make friends and be social.  I've gone through depression a few times in the past and I also have a bf who basically eliminated all of my friendships. I'm now starting off fresh.  I joined a couple of clubs where I'm learning how to be social because there's about 20+ individuals in each.  A toastmasters club and a BNI networking club. I go ones a week for about an hour and 30mins.  I've learned how to introduce myself to others. How to initiate a conversation and how to find interest in what they are saying.  I used to not care usually. I liked hearing myself talk.  

For networking I also go to mixers every other week. I also set up 121 meetings with people who I meet.  We talk about our businesses and share stuff about ourselves.  I notice that I've learned to really listen to others.  The more I have them talk about themselves the better they feel. It's like as if I make our conversation go to a place that brings out comfort from them.  When you make someone comfortable and feel good in there own skin and you genuinely seem interested in what they're saying.  These people will find you super amazing and interesting as well. That's how I've noticed that I'm able to get people to like me and want to do business with me and maybe want to hang out outside of business.  I road bike as a hobby and I'm meeting people who share that same interest as me and I've invited them to come join my group.  It's not pushy either. I just give them the details and they are usually that excited already and want to come.  

Just remember when you are making friends to make them comfortable. Don't focus on bringing them into your world.  Learn about theirs and eventually they'll want to join yours.  Please let me know if that makes sense.  "
soc_904663,socialskills,reddit_comment,133,"I respectfully disagree. You're completely within your rights to feel upset that a friend or group of friends keeps bailing on you, but at some point the onus is on you to decide wgether or not you want to keep that friendship going.

Perhaps I am missing the point of the PSA, but it seems to me that no one is telling you not to be upset about it when you don't get an apology or a token, bs excuse as to why the plans fell through.

IMO, they are saying that the person didn't have to interact with you at all in the first place--no one is owed social interactions just for existing.

This is only my perspective, and no one can tell you how to feel, just something to think about."
soc_470079,socialskills,reddit_comment,470,"Bruh, this isn't a math problem. You're trying to figure out a single algorithm for approaching girls, but there's so many things wrong with that way of thinking:

1. You can't generalize behavior to a rote series of steps and ""execute"" a routine every time for success. You've been told this time and again.
2. You're asking how you can know whether someone will be receptive in advance. Partly, I hope, out of consideration for the other person, but given the other things you've written, I get the sense that you're also doing it to shield your own ego and avoid the possibility of being seen as a creep. You can't account for the gamut of potential reactions you could get from approaching someone, because most of the factors are out of your control. Sure, there are things you can to improve your chances, but beyond common courtesy, how you're received isn't really up to you. You have to decide, situation by situation, whether approaching someone is worth the risk. And once you've done that, you need to pay constant attention to how you're being received.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You infer that I am angry; I did not say I was.

I wouldn't describe you as angry, but your original tone sure was petulant, self-pitying, and demanding. Like, do you not see the problem with repeating this so many times in your original post? Do you not see how that comes across?

&gt;What, exactly, are the rules?

She's not obligated to tell you them, but moreover, she probably don't know herself, because she can't speak so generally to something she does without thinking.

But that's on top of responding to a very real concern (being forced into a situation by someone with unknown intentions and not having an easy out) with this shit:

&gt;Noted. I will ensure there is a clearly marked exit somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there's all the other areas where you're responding as literally as possible to things (like the dog/cat comparison). I genuinely can't tell whether you're ridiculously dense, are trying to crack wise but don't know how to do it, or are being passive-aggressive in an attempt to save face. I get the frustration you're clearly facing, but you're going about things the wrong way by using uniquely male hardships to dismiss uniquely female ones. The risks that women face in random interactions are much higher. Like, I'm assuming you did read the other thread. Do you realistically think that men are ever going to face things like being pulled by the hair into another room? Those are the kinds of things women have to worry about. While you'd kill for a way to know whether your approach will be well-received, most women would settle for knowing whether the perfect stranger before them is socially and mentally well-adjusted."

You can want a fulfilling life. But you cannot expect others to hold your hand. Maybe do something different. Do what works and stick with that. 

Do what is/will be effective in achieving your goals, NOT what you feel/think you should do. Figure it out through trial and error. Clearly you keep doing the same shit over and over and then beat yourself up telling yourself nothing works. 

Life is an act. If people are not naturally attracted to your presence, then it is up to you to figure it out, no one else. If you have to act against your feelings, so that people don’t think you’re weird, well then you will never meet people who know the real you. Fuck the people who think you are weird, and embrace the people who think you are interesting. 

Stop thinking people even know why you make them feel the way you do. Because i guarantee you, most can’t put it into words why, and even if they could it is generally polite to not just lay into someone about how much you cannot stand them. 

This is entirely on you to figure out"
soc_1142483,socialskills,reddit_comment,129,"Yes, it can be under our control, you can definitely force yourself to smile more, or to not avert eyes so much, to stand taller, etc. 

But especially if no one can tell you what the 'off vibe' is about, it's not necessarily easy to understand what is 'off' about your presence, so that you can see if you can work on yourself to change that.

And I think this is what OP was talking about. Of course, it's not the fault of others that they can't explain, sometimes, we just can't what exactly it is...

So maybe the solution is to become super self-observing and self-analyzing, to try to figure out what it is... Maybe look at yourself in the mirror and try to see what others see."

soc_241128,socialskills,reddit_comment,175,"well not everybody gets upset and those that do, don't always get upset. There are times they can laugh it off and there are times it seems they can't accept the fact I won/am winning. Which makes them very angry.

When I win, I either don't care (because it was an unimportant match/it was an easy win), or I am genuinly happy and celebrate (for example a small tournament I won wednesday).

I don't know how I come across (I can't watch myself from another person's perspective), I think it depends on the person, some will think I'm an asshole for winning and some will be happy for me. It's those first people I probably have difficulty winning from because they are the upset ones I tend to go easy on. I don't think I rub my win in anyone's face. I tend to wait for the other person to say something first (apart from saying ""well played"" or ""thanks for the match"", which is standard), so that I can't possibly upset them (even more). "
soc_1105298,socialskills,reddit_comment,563,"By change, it doesn't mean surgery neccesarily. It could be make-up and clothes. And yes, what you say is very true, but unfortunately we live in a world where if something is out of our control, they will always find a way to make money.A great example of this is making people pay for period pads. Women can't control that is something so natural. So to be honest, the best way is to accept yourself more than others accept you. I'm not here to be the guru and say what's the best option, these are just one of many options that are more for self love to take care of yourself instead of doing it for others because the situation is usually about people wanting to change their own self, most likely because of societal expectations leading to insecurities. 

Health problems are another thing but I'm not a doctor so can't speak for all, just based off from my experience with my own insecurities. I got rid of wanting surgery because I realised I didn't need to change anything for people to love me, or to be successful because I learnt to avoid the ones who actually dislike me for what I am. The people around you, will define how you see yourself. Exercise the mind and realise that every negative words by people are all controlled from you and is your choice whether to get affected or not. 

I really hope that helps. If not I apologise. If you want to continue with spirituality (at least my version) keep reading :D

My definition of spirituality is about self-care and awareness of the mind in any given situation and how you can always change your perspective if you just sit and think about it from someone else's viewpoint.

In terms of opinions on looks and how it could causes mental health issues with insecurities and depression etc., as mentioned above you can always control how you get affected. This does not mean that sad feelings and negativity doesn't exist, but you can just shift away from it. That's why therapy exist. There are many techniques and one I usually do is this:

The very thing you think are negative may not even exist at all someplace in this world where their priorities are different. For example, do you think that people who are starving in Africa really care about looks? Or surgery? They really care more about quenching their thirst and hunger and couldn't give a damn about anything else because life at that point is what should be prioritised. So those insecurities that people receive from online are created because they make THAT as their environment. 

I'm not here comparing that their situation is worse than yours. All I'm saying is that, you can shift your reality into a completely new one if you could just realise that a lot of these is to do with the strength of your mind and whether you're going to let people opinions (or maybe they haven't said anything at all and that maybe you could be overthinking/getting anxious) actually affect your life? The Internet is a wonderful place and so is real life , but if you make whatever your focusing on, your environment, just be prepared to be strong. Otherwise, leave that environment and focus on something better.

soc_1262525,socialskills,reddit_comment,172,"It's not toxic. It's true. I don't owe anyone friendship. I don't owe anyone a relationship. I don't owe anyone sex. I don't owe anyone conversation. I don't owe anyone respect. 

All those things are things that I give freely to people I feel deserve it, to people I feel I have a mutual connection with, and to people with whom I have built trust and camaraderie with.

It's only toxic if you think you are owed something and you aren't getting it. Yes, there is give and take in relationships, but it's not solely up to YOU what that entails. Each person decides for themselves, and if you try to control what value another person puts on your contributions, you're gonna have a bad time. 

Control only what you can - yourself. Set healthy boundaries and stick to them. If you don't want to hang out with someone again even though they bought you a thousand dollar camera or held open every door for you, don't. You don't owe people anything."
soc_161636,socialskills,reddit_comment,281,"Well first of all, I doubt they actually consider you to be an outsider. Especially in your 20s, I don't think people really consider whether or not you grew up in that area. If the people you are going to be with are friends of your boyfriend, then they will most likely be treating you with respect and friendliness. I know it's hard, and believe me I know this doesn't help much (I used to have social anxiety), but it really is up to you how the situation goes. You just have to realize that people are there to hangout, enjoy music, and support their friends. You're not the first thing on their minds, and they aren't thinking negatively about you. 

If there's a conversation going on and you have something to contribute, just say it! Don't think about whether or not what you say will be stupid. By contributing, even if it makes you very nervous, your stress levels will naturally go down and you'll feel more comfortable.

Also, I'm not sure how comfortable you are talking to you boyfriend about your social anxiety and social skills, but it might be a good idea to have a little talk with him beforehand and tell him that you're nervous and it would be nice if he could try to naturally include you in conversations. 

Also, don't leave the show. Even if you start freaking out, just go to the bathroom or go smoke a cig and allow yourself some time to relax. Knowing that you attended a social event and stayed the whole way through will make you feel good, even if you were nervous the whole time.

soc_405200,socialskills,reddit_comment,157,"Well, it’s sort of a feedback cycle really.

Here’s a breakdown:

Look good —&gt; more people are willing to listen/ walk up to you than average —&gt; more second chances given even if you aren’t naturally charismatic —&gt; repeat opportunities —&gt; people like what you say —&gt; you notice —&gt; you become truly confident —&gt; multiply how much better you are at socialising

You see what I mean. But here’s the thing. You can break the feedback cycle. If you step into the ‘people like what you say... until ‘becoming better at socialising’, you can make it too. Of course, that’s more difficult, but with a lot of confidence and not giving two shits, you can really climb your way up there.

Is it more hard work? Does it require more guts? Is it a lengthier process?

Yes. But life’s not fair. So we gotta work with what we’ve got.

Say ""thank you so much! Thank you for coming, I hope you have a good time."" 


They'll ask you what your plans are next so think of how you'll answer ahead of time.

soc_1059879,socialskills,reddit_comment,658,"I think that the main issue is that you are dealing with some insecurity which distorts how you interpret your interactions with people. You are undervaluing yourself by a lot. First of all, I want to give you kudos for having such long-standing friendships. It takes a lot of effort to maintain connections as an adult and the fact that you've managed to do so says a lot about how great you are as a friend. You likely have a lot of great qualities but you are just not seeing them or appreciating them ( perhaps because you spend a lot of your time comparing yourself to other people). 

If you take time to really look at yourself objectively - not in relation to anyone, how would you rate yourself as a friend or even as a person? Are you open-minded, easy-going, energetic, thoughtful, fun?  Perhaps you are more pensive, introverted, dreamy. All of these are inherently beautiful and much needed. Once you can look at yourself objectively you can get to know and like yourself such that when you meet new people your first thought isn't ""am I good enough for them"" but rather ""are they good enough for me"". By the way, this process might reveal qualities that you may not like very much and you've got to face those and accept them as part of who you are at this moment. That acceptance need not lead you into complacency though. If you feel like there are things about yourself that you want to work on, you can do that. Humans are versatile, we grow and change and transform constantly without our conscious awareness so imagine how much we can change when we apply conscious awareness!

Think of the people you admire and write down what qualities you admire about them. Think about the degree to which you have those same qualities. I bet there is a lot of overlap- probably more than you think. Think about the things you value in a friendship. Maybe you value loyalty for example. How can you know if someone has that quality? Well, you observe them over time in various situations, and then you can deduce this. I think you'll find most of the really valuable qualities are hard to pin down- they aren't things we can know about someone we just met a few times. Keeping this in mind may help you not get so nervous around new people since you'll remind yourself to wait and see their true colors over time. Again you don't need to impress anyone, they should be impressing you- rather you guys should be impressing each other. 

Lastly, it may be worthwhile to examine the concept of rejection. We all get rejected from time to time, and it sucks. It hurt our ego and we may feel like a failure in some way. However upon closer inspection what is rejection really. Most of the time we face rejection, the person didn't really know us all that well. Maybe they had a cursory idea of what we are all about and they rounded that up to something they didn't like. Most people are not qualified to accept or reject us since they don't know us all that well. Even those who do may choose to do so because of circumstances or preferences that have little bearing on our inherent value. For instance, diamonds are really pretty and lots of people pay a ton of money to buy each other diamond jewelry. I personally am not interested in diamonds because I value gems- it is my personal preference. Even if everyone in the world thought the same as me and the value of diamonds drops, it doesn't take away from their inherent value as beautiful stones. So its the same with people- just because someone fails to perceive your value, does not diminish your value. These are just a few thoughts- hope it was helpful."

Touching a leg is pretty sexualized. You flirt by chatting with them and spending time with them and reading the room to see if they’re interested before initiating touch. You clearly have your social boundaries mixed up, and I would focus on figuring that out first. It’s very likely that because you were drunk you couldn’t read the room effectively and you were totally being creepy and disregarding it. You are NOT entitled to a woman’s time, you are not entitled to flirt with a woman, you are not entitled to touch a woman. Saying everyone else is “is allowed to flirt but you” sounds pretty damn entitled and almost as though one of the bigger reasons you’re valuing the women around you is for sex.

I spent most of my days in my room, dreading most interaction with my parents cause it would always be criticism. ""You never spend time with us"" ""You didn't load the dishwasher"". When I did do a chore I would get a snarky remark ""So you do know how to bring the trash outside"".. So i avoided them more.

Also school stressed me the fuck out. I wanted to show my parents that I could be as good as my siblings so I worked my ass off, often until the late evening, to get good grades. So naturally when I got out of my room for a break from studying, being bombarded with criticism didn't help. I wanted to relax a little and have ""just five minutes of peace"". 

So in summary my unwillingness to do chores was rooted in 

a) feeling like I would only get criticism no matter my choice (do a chore -&gt; get snarky comment; don't do a chore -&gt; get a snarky comment)
b) just to spite them cause of the snarky remarks even if i did do the chores
c) being overwhelmed with school (I'm generally very easily stressed and was very bad at drawing boundaries between work and freetime which made me feel on edge 24/7 cause there was always an assignment or a test lurking at the back of my mind)



But now to kind of get your hopes up, my situation now: I moved out half a year ago and my home is clean, i cook fresh almost every day (tho tbh that's mostly cause I want my partner to have a homecooked meal and a clean home, if it was just me i would probably be a lot more lazy cause of the aforementioned issues at drawing boundaries between uni and my personal life. also cooking is cheaper than takeaway).


Now, cleaning stuff and especially cooking and organizing is a calming activity for me (it's just always a little hard to start). Once I get going I can forget about my worries and just focus on the task at hand. 

I wish my parents had shown me that, instead of criticizing me all the time. The only time I felt like that when I still lived at home was when I was cutting veggies when my mom cooked. We had pleasant conversations then and it was a relaxing atmosphere cause you can't complain about cutting veggies wrong :P


So my advice would be this: Don't see it as chores, see it as therapy. (sure some tasks are just annoying e.g taking out trash, but most chores that last a bit longer, like doing dishes, unloading the dishwasher, hanging up laundry, sweeping etc. can help to calm someone down cause the task is fairly simple).

Offer your daughter to spend time with you while you do a chore, next time she comes home and seems stressed and goes to sit down somewhere to wind down. For example, while you cook, invite her to sit at the kitchen table so you two can chat. Then get talking, just about casual stuff to help take a bit of the stress off. 

Then just invite her to help (cause she is already talking to you, she can also keep her hands busy while doing that). But down yell at her the minute she does something wrong, show her how to do it first without judgement if she seems resistent.

If something goes wrong and if it's not a huge thing (like using the wrong cleaner on the beautiful hardwood floor) but rather a small issue (the carrots aren't cut into very evenly sized pieces) let it slide. It'll come with routine.

Use it as a chance to spend carefree, relaxed time with your daughter and she'll probably be more open to help.

Maybe she will still be resistant to some tasks (like ironing, god i hate ironing with passion) but maybe that won't be such big a deal if she does some other things that she might like more than you and you do the task she doesn't like. But that's for a later stage, when she's already happy to do a few things i guess.

But that's just my two cents, maybe your daughter has a different situation than me back in the day, that's just how i would have liked to be introduced to chores.

good luck, and please don't be mean when she asks questions that might seem obvious (how do i separate the laundry?)."
soc_247941,socialskills,reddit_comment,332,"I want you to be right but in my own shitty experience it can go either way. And unfortunately sometimes the people who prove they aren't worth shit when you hit them with real talk can be pretty important people in your life, like your boss. And if they're not worth shit you might not want to work for them in theory, but food and shelter are important.

To OP I would say there's no easy answer. It's up to you to decide what to say to who, and when. If your safety or livelihood is on the line I think it's perfectly acceptable to deflect questions, be vague, say you don't want to talk about it, or even lie, all where legally permissible of course.

Not out of shame, but because creating friction in certain relationships can harm you for no good reason. Think of it as simplification, a kind of relationship lubricant for simple relationships that you want to keep simple and superficial. Sometimes it can backfire. A simple, boring story that needs no further explanation is best. ""I partied around the Bahamas for a year"" is going to prompt more questions than ""I helped take care of my elderly Grandma for a year"". You can always come back and give an authentic account of what happened later if and when you feel you need to.

It's important to recognize that the origin of shame is judgement, and judgment usually has little basis in objective fact. Other people's judgment is always influenced by their ignorance. They're not you. They have no frame of reference for what you're talking about. You can't control how they're going to react. If the stakes are low, whatever. If the stakes are high, if you have to get something off your chest, tell it to your therapist. For anyone else, decide before you speak whether getting what you have to say off your chest is worth the risk of being misunderstood and suffering the consequences."
soc_1693666,socialskills,reddit_comment,209,"So sorry you're dealing with this! I think you've handled it very politely (including feeding them when then 'dropped by' with an extra guest while leaving you uncertain as to their intentions.) I think the man is a bully (more aggressive/aggressive than passive aggressive!), as evidenced by his wife's reaction. If I were the wife I'd be telling him straight up to cut it out! 

Your reaction (rescuing your dog and going into the house) was the best way to deal with the situation without creating a scene. However I don't know that there's any way to fix this without alienating the neighbors. I wouldn't be inclined to invite them to anything else. (who needs that kind of treatment? especially with his prior insults regarding your accent!) 

And if you're standoffish they may press the issue and try to figure out why you're not as friendly. But I honestly wouldn't want any more interaction with these people.

Sorry I don't have a better answer, but hopefully you and your husband can come up with a plan to limit your contact with them while being basically ""distanced but still polite"" neighbors. 

Personally I wouldn't accept any invitations from them either, but of course that's your call to make.

Good luck!"
soc_526408,socialskills,reddit_comment,215,"Not sure I have anything super helpful to add, but I have the same exact problem! I can public speak all day for the same reasons you described, but if my husband drags me off to a gathering of his acquaintances and no one specifically starts a conversation with me, I won't approach and force my way into a conversation. One difference for me is I don't think I experience it as anxiety. I experience it more as a feeling of discomfort if I sense that the other person isn't very interested in what I'm saying. Who's to say my ""sense"" is based in fact or more just an assumption, but there are a rare few people who I can carry on a back and forth conversation with, without feeling like I'm boring them.

It's been my experience that most people aren't very good at asking other people questions, and are busy thinking about what they want to say or do. I honestly don't have a good solution--that's one of the reasons I'm on this sub--but I can at least tell you that I'm sure there are a lot of people who experience what you experience.

soc_1614528,socialskills,reddit_comment,416,"If I misunderstood you or misrepresented you in any way then my apologies OP. But let's not pretend that an absolute stranger online is going out of their way to maliciously and intentionally misrepresent you. It's juvenile and just makes you look emotional. There is just no motive for me to do so...

I'm happy to concede that I misunderstood you, of course (and I apologize for doing so). But this shouldn't be a surprise as it happens all the time on the text-based Internet. But it wasn't intentional or calculated. And it upsets me because I know you're smart enough to know this already... And yet you still chose to say it? 

Now that *is* legitimate misrepresentation on your end and you've been caught red-handed in doing so. 

At the end of the day if you and I agree then I am glad that we both see eye to eye on matters. Although, I would like to stipulate that there would also be no bad blood even if we did disagree as everything I say is merely my opinion. And my opinion isn't fact. It is just my opinion... Which means I can still respect someone's position which is different to mine (as they very well could be right just as I could be wrong). Me disagreeing with someone doesn't make them wrong or right. Just as agreeing with myself doesn't make me the leading authority on matters. 

I would suggest in future not taking people's opinions so personally in future. Not everyone on here has to be your enemy. I merely express my differences of opinion so I can potentially explore the flaws of my own reasoning. 


Lastly, you did admittedly say *""wait for it to come only works if you're the best version of yourself.""* 

That isn't me misrepresenting. That is what you said in verbatim. *'Only'* suggests there is no alternative as it *'only'* works if you're the best version of yourself. As in, there is no other way as it is the *only* way. This isn't true and I've told you why with examples of my own life experience that directly contradict this. Don't say it next time if you don't actually mean it. 

So I'd recommend you say what you mean next time if you have a zero-tolerance policy towards miscomprehension or misunderstandings.

I don't doubt at all that I misunderstood you. But it also isn't hard to see why. A little understanding and self-awareness can go a long way..."

He stopped stimming publicly too - which in the end, all the masking and hiding who he was ended up affecting his mental health. He burned out...

soc_318328,socialskills,reddit_comment,121,"Yep, your first paragraph sums it up nicely. In response to your third paragraph, people can change over time, so what you're experiencing seems perfectly normal to me. However, it could be changes in your social circle that are causing you to want to interact with others less, rather than changes happening to yourself. Just my opinion, but trying to set up a quota of interactions will probably end up making it feel like a chore and be even less appealing to you. Just hang out when you feel like it, meet new people, and who knows maybe you'll come across someone who you enjoy the company of enough that it will make you want to interact with them more often."

soc_1215866,socialskills,reddit_comment,180,"You are definitely not in the wrong. 

If these are your best friends you should sit them down and talk - with no alcohol. Tell them how you’re feeling about alcohol and that you are thinking about not drinking it anymore. Tell them that you still want to hang out and have a good time, you may just not be drinking. Heck, you can be the designated driver for the evening, which is a sure fire way to ease it in. 

Tell them that you hope that they can respect your decision and support you. You need that from your friends. If they can’t do that you simply can’t be with them while they’re drinking any more. 

I’ve done this myself in periods where I had to stop drinking myself, and I have two friends who had the same talk and stopped drinking completely. We are all still going out together and having a good time. Those that aren’t drinking are taking non-alcohol drinks or juice instead. It has been amazing for the dynamic of the group as well 😊"

Anger and dominance are problems though.

What I suggest is, instead of having this ‘fake you’ that will, in the end, get you nowhere in terms of long-standing friendships/relationships, you should work on the anger and dominance issues. (Idk you so the best I can advise is a therapist, but it depends on your situation of course.) And once these issues are settled, find someone that will like that cringe, obsessive self of yours!! Might be a little long but it absolutely will be more rewarding in the end.

soc_59035,socialskills,reddit_comment,359,"Okay, first off, just forget about that perspective that people have ""paired up"" or are in their own ""groups."" You can meet people at any time. It doesn't matter if they have friends or not. Chances are the people you do meet will already have friends and if you just meet one person, you can meet their friends through them. That's how networking and friendships work. You meet one person and then you meet another through that person and another and another. And if you get really good at just talking to strangers on the street, you can expand pretty fast (but I think that's way beyond what you're thinking about or wanting at the moment). You already know you can make some people laugh, right? Your current friends already enjoy you, right? Who's to say more people won't also enjoy you? Don't focus on trying to get anything out of anyone. Don't look for validation. Don't look for them to like you. Focus and remember that you are awesome to people that already know you and you can be awesome to people you just met too. Maybe you won't be as funny at first, but that doesn't matter. You'd be in the ""getting to know them"" phase. And this phase can be an exciting time! You can tell your story, make new jokes, find out about the other person.

Don't worry about pissing people off by saying the wrong thing. You WANT to piss some people off by being yourself. If you weren't being yourself, then when they do find about the real you (and they will), then they wouldn't be your friend anyway. And you don't want to be friends with people that won't be friends with the real you.

If you want a helpful book, read Dale Carnegie's How To Win Friends and Influence People. It's real simple, a lot of the concepts are straight forward and seem obvious. It's just nice that he actually says them and why they're important.

Do you think she'd try and use this as an opportunity to turn the group on you? Does she respond better alone? Can you get her alone for a substantial amount of time? All of these things matter.

I am going to respond to this different than usual as you think differently...which is beautiful. You appear to have a lot of self doubt, I suggest you look into these three areas of changing your mental state; perception, mirroring and anchoring. A person lost 10 lbs, that person is also overweight, both are true statements however it is our perception that makes the difference. I of course do not mean this in a polyannic way, but it is better to see the positives. Mirroring: Find a video of someone you idolize socially, copy their mannerisms, the more the better...you'll begin to see the world through their eyes. Finally anchoring; remember a time when you had social success, imagion how it looked, sounded and felt, when you reach the highest state touch somewhere on your body. Do that several times and you'll find when you do it later you get into the state without thinking about it. 

The reason I chose to respond this way is that I know you'll use your intellect to find out more about these ideas yourself, pm me with any further questions."

soc_841630,socialskills,reddit_comment,1765,".....A smile isn’t the issue, communicating period is the issue.

This is a long read, but worth it.

If you’re freezing up and not talking at all, is &amp; will be the main issue.

I really hate when people say “smile” more.

Myself.

Being told to act differently, when nothing you’re doing is wrong, isn’t ok, and it sends the wrong message, especially in verb-able.

Smiling, more doesn’t do something you think it would for someone else who doesn’t do that emote, as a normal response.

Which then what happens, is the person who is uncomfortable, is trying to smile while simultaneously.

That makes for a awkward situations, because it sends several different cues.

A awkward smile can be misread;

As “omg this creep is actually interested in me.”

Or “please don’t hurt me.”

Or “wtf do I do, he is too close to me.”

If you’re interested &amp; you want them to know.

First try to communicate, that you’re having difficulty talking first.

Second be honest, say you’re feeling shy, do not assume any man will know you’re shy, and then say you do not want to be misread to them out loud to them.

This by itself makes, whoever, stop, assuming information, and will hopefully lead to better communication.

While Smiling &amp; expecting the world to be handed to you, is manipulation 101.

As all the women, for whatever reason, who have ever told me to smile more!

Have been psychopaths, thinks, I’m interested, does manipulative things to get attention or worse tells lies about me.

Not only 1 person, it is like a movie.

Girl says smiles more, indirectly is stalking, later scene she is trying to either get you fired because you don’t feel the same way about her or is trying to stab you in a parking lot over rejection.

(One has done a DNA test on me and we never dated, to give you a clue.)

Like what wtf? lol

But back on task, You know how to make a smile work, actually?

You feel good first, then smile about someone or something, and then you look directly at someone who you’re attracted towards.

If you’re not in the frame of mind, of, feelings good, &amp; then you’re smiling at someone doesn’t make them, interested by default less he is bat shit crazy.

As I f she sends the wrong message, then she will feel worse because she didn’t communicate properly.

And if you cannot talk, still shy and you keep freezing up.

Get in the habit of self-affirmation, tell yourself, what you plan to do to get their attention, and what you want to happen to yourself, with them and make it into a movie to yourself.

Imagination is limit, do not be scared to used, just don’t get your imagination and reality confuse.

This is a technique, literally Albert Einstein’s used daily, he literally used his imagination to figure physics out because he sucked at math lol.

This lets you build up more momentum.

Learn to make gestures, like grabbing someone close, if you cannot talk or make signs to say wait, please for one moment for me.

If he is actually interested and patient.

Like holding one finger in the air, to indicate “give me one moment” for yourself.

Put your face in your hands to partly, to indicate embarrassment or feeling shy, when you’re feeling shy so that they know what you’re feeling.

Everyone, does this, even dogs, cats, birds, bears, wolves, even freaking hyena and dolphins, do it embarrassment gesture to tell say hey I am embarrassed... lmao

If a guy, is too impatient for you, to give you even a moment to, build up, courage to talk too.

Don’t bother with him, period!

That is coming, from a man.

If a another man, cannot give you two seconds or even 30 minutes, then you need to move on, and look for someone who is going to actually going, to be patient with you.

As I have met plenty, of shy women myself and all didn’t communicate properly.

Half them have acted, like they did, while they didn’t even communicate or converse properly at all entire time.

Meaning they ask questions, maybe once or twice, and then expected me and most women do this, to hold a conversation for two people.

Which then people, get annoyed, because, “that lol dude can’t stop talking about himself?”

Lol he is talking about himself, because he wants you to like him.

He cannot talk about anything else because he is feeling shy himself, or doesn’t know what to talk about or about you to know even further what is allowed to converse about, it isn’t because “all men-narcissistic hoogaboiga!?”

Men, also need patience, from women and unfortunately, I have yet, to see a patient woman, in the 36 years I have existed, it is weird.

This doesn’t mean they don’t exist, just that I attract impatient and judgmental women.

With that said, we, both, should look for someone actually patient for ourselves, is and what should take priority, they need to be willing to communicate for starters and willing to give you, their time and not complain about what time they have left, while willing to allow you to be yourself and accept you, however you’re emoting period.

Whether you’re smiling, being shy, angry or whatever, whoever needs to stand their ground to support each other.

If I met a woman, and she couldn’t allow me to text, how I like, or make intentionally grammatically errors, because I am a dork, first and shy second, who likes to be myself or emote defaultly without me smiling, and or allowing me to make up my own stupid words.

Unfortunately, she is getting ghosted.

I hope anything I have shared was helpful!

I don’t like watching people get, half-ass answers also.

You guys should try it, the being patient, part, instead putting one worded sentence and then expecting a domino effect.

Patience goes hand and hand with the domino effect your after, in all universal cases of momentum.

You can’t do or say one thing, and expect everything to lay out at your feet.

You need to be willing to take the time, to cultivate and communicate, properly, to form a actual relationship.

This way, you also don’t end up with someone, who you don’t want to be with at the beginning, for whatever time frame your interested in or what your willing to spend, whether it is “3 months to the year crap” I keep seeing, to switch out boyfriends like shoes. Lol

It isn’t a women or men, trait either.

Both, and all genders do that &amp; therefor, it triggers me.

We all need to better, converse as time progresses, you cannot replace a entire conversation with, a god damn emote, people, I swear, to funny. lmao

I like literally, laughing as I am texting.

This is perfect, example of how impatient our race is and then has the egos the size of a building, “still”.

But third, and this is a very important step!

Be patient with yourself, while trying to communicate effectively, and care of you first and not the guy or man or whatever.

You’re prioritizing you first, he should be doing same.

As we all need to, care more and love ourselves for our own unique quirks, and traits.

Being shy, maybe, a trait now to you, you never know.

It very well could grow and blossom into something further very beautiful, if allowed it too.

And don’t date manipulative men, same goes for me, don’t date manipulative women.

You want to be happy, yourself with someone, who will not be, antagonist the entire relationship isn’t fun.

Relationships period, should feel natural and be smooth as real butter and completely stress free, people, to build, not what I keep seeing, which is trying to reenact soap scenes.

Which is, in advance creates unnecessary drama for yourself, for no reason, to further have a problem, to have to solve, prior or later, to getting to know someone else.

That Isn’t how you build a foundation for a relationship, as so far, I have been trying to date myself.

Everyone I have met, so far, has unfortunately misunderstood, me, as well.

You shouldn’t be trying to trigger yourself during a relationship by via thinking of your ex either, during a new person you are trying to get to know.

This causes assumptions by default, both and all genders do this.

And assuming the new guy or gal, you met is the cause.

As subconscious, is a trillionth faster than our consciousness, this means you are thinking about stuff that bothers you waay, before you started talking at all..

You have to practice control of what you’re thinking, and what you allow what you’re subconsciously thinking at all times, helps you grow into who you want to be, while doing different stuff, same goes for social interactions, you have to practice while being around other people.

This isn’t some childish notion, you are supposed to be proactively learning about each other, at all times when you have a chance.

9/10 I have rarely seen a woman practice this, as in most my personal cases, I am assumed of something I am not, then it is back to square one, or ghosted because of simple impatience and impartial learning, by trying to figure someone out in advance.

Because, that isn’t actually learning at all...

It literally, takes a single person on average 10 years, to fully understand another human being, and yet we humans try to fit 10 years into 1 minute, like that is logical sense. Lol

Even if you can read, all micro expressions, you still need time &amp; people are way to impatient with themselves as this leads to being impatient with each other, when we should give a damn about each other.

Which is why our society has advanced so much, we shared information &amp; we shared resources has made us pretty badass, now, we have people thinking backwards, trying to hoard everything, when that equals not growing at all.

Everyone is different, so by proxy, you need to be able to adapt, to learn to better communicate, but be, always vigilant in staying true to yourself till You decide, who You want to be and when You” want to be something else.

This way, you never regret who you were, &amp; you can be happy in the now, appreciate, who you once were, while you keep growing!

Be safe and take care!"

soc_1189767,socialskills,reddit_comment,186,"I think it might make sense to start looking at establishing healthy boundaries and figuring out a safe way to set boundaries with your parents so that you can carve out your own space. With the assistance of a professional if need be. Even with controlling parents, it's possible that they may understand that if it's impacting your mental health then they need to give you room to grow. It's up to you if you want to share that or not, but there's lots of material out there on boundary setting, not that you need more to study!  


As for social skills, there's nothing like practice. I personally can't handle groups of people I don't know, but one on one is a lot easier for me. I think it's helpful to identify exactly what the problem you feel with social skills is ... do you lack confidence or does your mind go blank? Something like meditation might help with those. Do you feel you have nothing to say about the things that people are interested in? Targeted social groups (""meetups"" type things) might be helpful. etc."
soc_473081,socialskills,reddit_comment,534,"Well, first of all, did someone actually straight up approach you and condemned or criticized you for that? Because I personally wouldn't mind or even care if I was hanging with you and you were to pull 'that' off. And I would definitely not bother evaluating it as an observer and recipient. Purely because it's not really a big deal. It's not even a deal of any kind. People often times, especially us milennials, talk about such meaningless shit, that it never ceazes to amaze me, that actually 'those' people usually find themselves within a huge circle. Do you know why? It's the small talk and 'those' guys constantly have a mouth full of it. Though it's not apparent at first, small talk is the number 1 easiest way to establish a foundation with pretty much any human being, so long as they allow you to by listening. And it doesn't have to be about anything important or relevant. It literally can and often is about meaningless shit.
So, in answer to your dilemma: no. You're not weird. If anything, you stand out from the crowd by having those two unique traits that make you who you are.  Now, maybe if you were trying to attract a girl, that bit about you sharing too much personal information would be kinda perceived as a slight turn-off (not claiming it would for sure), but that's only because chicks prefer a guy with an air of mystery about them ;) Unless you're going for the friend-zone, then by all means! They love having emotional male friends around them. 
I speak from my experience, because in a way I too was somewhat similar to you. I thought that by being open about literally every aspect of my life, with a chick I liked, was gonna make her warm up to me and trust me and stuff like that. And it was working precisely like that, alright! But not in the right direction I wanted it to go, instead drifting off to.. where? Yes, friend-zone. So I did find myself wondering about it too. What the hell? My mum taught me to be a gentleman after all. So I was. Then, years later I found channel on Youtube called BasedZeus and everything started to come to me straight. I found the truth of the universe. Chicks love bad guys who don't give two shits about them and then ghost them, when girls try to reach them in text. And you'd be amazed, but it started to work for me like immediately, as soon as I applied those principals. I swear to God, ghosting a chick on Messenger or text is the biggest turn on for her. Because for all she knows, you have got such busy and amazing life that u didn't even have time to pick up the phone.
Nah, but seriously, you're okay, dude. Again if I was talking to you, I wouldn't even notice anything weird about this. And also, that bit about u being too open, I daresay if anything, it'll make people like you more. That's just my perspective though.

sometimes i feel like if a person keeps asking questions after one another it feels “fake” - like this person is trying to seem like they’re super interested in you while in reality they aren’t (which obviously wasn’t your case though). i had a friend back in high school who seemed overly eager no matter what i answered, and asked a TON of questions, which i grew tired of. it felt too fake to me, like she was trying *too hard*. (please note that i am not saying you do this. at all)

i think, personally, that the key is a nice balance. if the other person is interested in talking to you too, they’ll ask questions back, and you’ll have a better conversation too, not just a one-sided question/answer type of conversation.

soc_492505,socialskills,reddit_comment,230,"I'd say it's not that you hate small-talk, it's that you don't understand the purpose of it.

Do you think anyone genuinely enjoys talking about the weather? or traffic? Or whatever BS story was on the news last night? No one truely cares about these things. That's not why they talk about it. They talk about it because it's super awkward to walk up to someone and say ""Tell me about your relationship with your parents"".

You start with something meaningless and trivial. If the other person is receptive, they'll start sharing more personal details about themselves. You can then take those tidbits of information and use them to create a bond with that person.

Smalltalk is step one of the social game. It's supposed to be a very short step. If you're talking to someone about the weather for 5 minutes, move on to someone else. If you're unable to talk to anyone about something other than the weather, then you need to get a book on smalltalk and learn how to use it to segue into deeper conversations.

You're viewing smalltalk as the entire game. You just need to start seeing it as a handshake. An expression of interest in a social exchange. You may not ever ENJOY smalltalk, but you can learn to enjoy the conversations it opens up to you.

soc_672821,socialskills,reddit_comment,255,"Someone told me recently that I might be a little like this in real life... I try and skip the small talk (I'm shit at it) and go straight into bigger conversations, which makes people I don't know well uncomfortable. They don't know enough about me to have points of reference or trust me with more personal facts or stories about themselves. In a constructive way (because again, I do something very similar), I do think it would be a little strange getting a message like this from someone I don't really talk to very much in person. Just imagine if someone in real life that you don't know super well came up to you and started talking for even 30 seconds about themselves... it might feel awkward. It also doesn't leave them very much to ask you about. Start with a ""hey, what's up?"" Hopefully, they'll ask you back. Don't give too much detail. ""School and work are killing me."" They'll probably respond that they feel the same. Then, it's natural to elaborate. But try and keep social media interactions shorter, unless their messages are getting consistently longer - that should indicate that they're trying to go a little deeper. I also might try and save a couple of things they've mentioned over social media to ask them about next time you see them so you become closer friends outside of the digital world. I hope this helps.

Whether what you started saying got their attention, or if what the other person started saying was more relevant. And whether you were too soft spoken to be heard in the first place.

soc_610765,socialskills,reddit_comment,269,"No need to apologize. 

I think it depends on the person. Age is just an overemphasis of what you were and never decided to make a change.

I was an idiot kid that was raised by the most patient grandparents and parents (maybe both your senior?). Patience is a huge virtue that is emphasized and instilled. I was actually less caring in my adolescence as a form of counter culture to it. Then I saw how it was much easier to be patient and everything went well. If you see that people are just inherently selfish and mostly ignorant of others feelings if they’re not expressed.  

(I had actually typed something else but I accidentally deleted it when I was in convo with my nephews ugh too lazy)

Side Note:

There’s people that like to smoke weed and just be on the phone while driving deep into convo.
There’s some that embrace each other while talking. 

So these same social skills don’t apply around. And some people are too entrenched in their social circle that they literally don’t know anything else. By being self aware, it’s kinda on you. Like you’re not technically responsible but if your cognizant of this say something. 

BUT at the end of the day fuck off whoever you want to fuck off. 

I do this a lot with non-attractive/lazy/dumb people even if they’re cool-ish. But that’s cuz I’m  superficial-ish because most of my best times and most engaging convos come with these people, so I’ll ignore others. Or not put any effort.  But that’s just cuz I care about my time being good lol."
soc_558080,socialskills,reddit_comment,639,"Damn, this is sooo much to explain but I don’t want to write you a novel. Basically:

tl;dr if these kinds of things are said habitually (especially with the intent to change someone’s behavior) yes, it’s emotional abuse. The key here is that this is a pattern of behavior over time and not one-off remark.

First off, when you don’t like someone’s behavior, the appropriate response is to share how you feel (and let *them decide* whether or not they’ll change) and/or distance yourself from them if their behavior crosses rigid boundaries. Attempting to change their behavior is manipulative. If you are telling someone the way they’re feeling is inappropriate, with the intent that they come around and agree with your opinion, it’s inherently manipulative. Performing any action with the hope/intent that the action will affect another person’s decisions is manipulation. Poor communicators confuse passive aggressive behavior for direct communication but it’s really just... manipulation lol.

Second, emotions are neither valid nor invalid. Rather, they are physiological, biological responses to stimuli. For each person, the way the body emotionally reacts is the way it was predisposed to and/or learned to react, and there is nothing good or bad, right or wrong about it. It just is. It’s nature. It’s twisting reality to view emotions as valid or invalid, because there is no rule book for emotions. ex:

A: You said you would have this conversation with me, but you’re not making time to have the conversation. I’m feeling disposable.

B: Well, that’s a silly way to feel. It’s not that important.

One must wonder what is B’s purpose in telling someone else that their feelings are silly? 

1) First interpretation: to shut A up. If a feeling is silly then it doesn’t need to be talked about. This kind of manipulation is called “dismissal.” If you dismiss the importance of someone’s feelings, then they begin to question whether or not their feelings are appropriate. The truth is that feelings are just feelings and cannot be inappropriate. But B is promoting a reality where it’s possible for feelings to be silly and unimportant, and B intends for A to adopt this reality. This is called “mind-warping,” another tactic of emotional abuse. 

2) Let’s consider the idea that B is actually very interested in having this conversation with A, but is just terrified that having the conversation will lead to an end of their friendship. This means B has told A their feelings are silly and unimportant in order to avoid a conversation, not because B doesn’t care about what A has to say but because B would rather A feel as if A’s feelings are unimportant, than to be honest and have a tough conversation. B, at best, is a cowardly asshole. If B does this often to avoid conversation, B is an emotionally abusive cowardly asshole.

3) And again let’s consider an alternate situation, where B actually said that to comfort A. B does not want A to feel disposable. Also, B believes that A is looking at this from the wrong perspective, and just needs a nudge in the right direction. In this case, the phrases “that’s a silly way to feel” and “it’s not that important” don’t accomplish B’s goals to comfort A. Those statements are belittling and dismissive, and being belittled and dismissed is not comforting (welp, it can be for people who are used to it, but if you notice that you consistently attract victims of emotional abuse, that’s another clue that you have a habit of emotional abuse).

I’m sure there are other examples. I think anyone would be hard pressed to explain how invalidating how people feel *isn’t* abusive without using invalidation to do it, considering that victims of domestic violence consistently report invalidation of emotions as a tool used by their abusers."
soc_1358696,socialskills,reddit_comment,820,"You can learn to be funny, it's just a lot more complicated and nuanced than anyone lets on. Theres like 8 forms of comedy or something, idk it's not an area I know much about. Some people go to comedic school. And on top of that it's all based in social interaction, so having good social skills is almost a prerequisite to be funny. On top of that, comedy is what other people find funny, so you have to know your audience. Doesnt matter what you find funny, because that's not making other people laugh. 

In general I think part of the problem is that you are underestimating the effort involved in performing any task because you aren't used to it. Guitar practice isn't fun, playing guitar is. Many hobbies take a level of proficiency before they can be ""enjoyed"". 

When I'm trying to teach myself piano, it's real easy for me to look listen to some bach or Mozart and get discouraged because I can barely play basic pieces. It took me half a year to get there AND I can already read some music and have all the basic skills necessary to read and comprehend musical notation because I took 8 years of band in highschool as a trumpet player. 

Most of my hobbies that I'm REALLY good at have years of relevant experience from my youth. Honestly, a good chunk, that's why I enjoy them. Distance running sucks, but I miss my highschool cross country team and the team comradery so I seek out team sports and team based hobbies.

Hobbies won't stick if you're not doing them for you either and it sounds like you're using them as an extension to get something else. I used to use guitar because I wanted to be a rockstar and perform on stage. I still want to, but I can't do that if I'm not good at guitar. The problem is, if I don't enjoy the act of learning to play and the instrument itself, I can't have the end goal. If the end goal is all I want, I get no reward for my daily effort, I won't play guitar.

You have no reason to stick with your hobbies because they aren't what you want, you aren't getting any enjoyment from them. Honestly, for most people, you don't need interesting hobbies, I never talk to my coworkers cause they're always going on about some TV show I've never seen and have no desire to. 

Another problem I've faced in the past was that when I was actively searching for a relationship, I focused my social skills too much on dating and that I was LOOKING to meet a person I had already defined in at least one way; a woman that I'm physically attracted to. How many social connections I could have made that might have led me directly to that woman if I wasn't so blind as to be looking for a rose in a field of wildflowers?

I don't have a good solution for you on that note because some of it's really personal. No one can tell you how to find another person interesting. There is probably a magic formula and you'll get a few of those tips and you can find textbooks on being a conversationalist and that'll get you pretty far. But you have to find that thing that make other people interesting to you. Same thing for all things that involve effort

If you can't find a personal reason to enjoy the effort involved in something, then it's always going to be a miserable experience no matter what you do.

Edit: I'm gonna just throw a tl;dr summary of my ramblings. You want something that you can't get without something else, but you can't find a way to enjoy the other things that you feel you need to do to get what you want so you aren't improving because you aren't putting any real effort towards those things. You can't put effort towards something you don't enjoy without a reward (unless it's for survival, but different topic). We work because we're paid or we wouldn't do that bullshit. You have to find a reason to enjoy what you are doing if you want to be motivated to keep doing it. And that motivation is internal. I enjoy the effort and difficulty and the feeling of accomplishment of learning new skills, that motivates me. It might or might not motivate you. You'll have to find your motivation and sometimes, the motivaters are garbage and need changed (i.e. finding a girlfriend, or as I like to call it HAPPINESS IN ANOTHER PERSON, a terrible motivator, even worse since it's about something you don't have in this example. Also not to be confused with happiness OF another person which is a place where narcissists and people with obsessive tendencies can get mixed up in particular.)."

I don’t talk much about myself because you would be surprised how little anyone cares, or how little anyone asks.     When someone finally does ask about me I feel a bit shy because I don’t find myself more interesting than the person I am speaking with.   

I also don’t use much social media.  It creates an internal feeling of discontent and self interest so I deleted my Facebook, Instagram, and several other platforms.

I chose to live in the moment and feel this has forced me to care significantly more about the people in front of me.   

The point is, you should not make this person out to be a monster with motives behind their kindness and understanding simply because you don’t understand why you like this person so much.  

It was your choice to tell them your life story, it does not sound like this person forced you.

We might have identical twins but they are still different. Second I think we tend to overthink a lot of things in our lives. When we do that it tends to evolve into something far worse. As individuals, we need to find that something we can hold on to, to make us feel validated. We need to look into ourselves and breathe. Take things and slow them down. Find something for ourselves to take that overthinking out. If we focus on the things we view as negative it will eat us alive and I also believe we all know this to be true. We can’t make people think the way we want them to, because it’s not fair to them. I know I have definitely been blinded by my own overthinking and it almost ruined my marriage. I realized it wasn’t how I thought it was, because I masked everything with this obstructed view I had. I never stopped and truly began to truly listen to what she was saying. You have to look at the other ways your friends show you they care. They may not show it the way you view it and it’s up to you to see their way before it ruins a friendship.

I sometimes have to pretend I have 1 brother instead of 2 just so I don't make others uncomfortable with the truth.  But that feels shitty, too, to have to dismiss my other brother. But that's not anyone's fault but the grief. And again, I never think it's the fault of the person who asked.

I can't tell you the right way to approach it as everyone is different, but if I had that happen I would definitely appreciate anyone who tries to acknowledge that it happened.  Just tell him ""I'm incredibly sorry for putting you on the spot the other day by asking about your sibling. I'm sure it was hard to talk about and I'm sorry if it makes you uncomfortable for bringing up again, but I just wanted to say I""m really sorry for your loss.

soc_853485,socialskills,reddit_comment,201,"Finding the right people, but that takes practice. Over time you'll learn to know who is willing to invest their time into knowing you and vice versa. It's difficult to find a friend that genuinely cares about you and is willing to prioritize you as well. 

But it all starts off from being yourself, not trying overly hard to fit in and eventually you will find people gravitating towards you - and you towards them. I think it also goes down by finding similar interests although I have a few friends that are polar opposites to me, but knowing who wants to make an effort to be your friend is a start. Because you don't want to invest a lot of time in a lot of people - you want to narrow that down.

Don't feel obligated to keep people who are negative, toxic or want to bring you down. Ain't nobody got time for that. But make sure you know your self worth, and that you treat others well and hope that they do too. Friendships will never be equal, but you want it to be as closely balanced as possible.

soc_1639698,socialskills,reddit_comment,238,"It’s great friendly advice, but exposure therapy is about being exposed to the things you find the most scary, or awkward, or both. It’s a real, very robustly researched therapy form, not for someone who is (a little, or quite) shy and wants to try and be more outgoing. It’s for anxiety and mood disorders, the problems are a bit heavier hence why the solution is too and might come off as a bit much :) 
By being exposed you desensitize. A well known exercise for example is ‘shouting in the library’. Not normal, very awkward, you can expect some people being grumpy about it, someone might even come up to you and complain. 
But, the planning and also the reflection afterwards is just as important; that’s why it’s wise to do it with a therapist. In the example above the planning would involve setting very specific expectations (like there could be an angry mob trying to kill me for shouting in the library, or more realistically, I will feel awkward for the rest of my life) and the reflection could involve a feeling of relief, nobody said a thing, I felt awkward for a bit but it went away, etc. 
So OP, way to go! But try to involve someone (experienced) in the planning and or reflection for when you’re waiting on a good therapist.

Don't do anything differently just because they know now. 

As a girl, I've had this happen once or twice in my life and I always feel bad because I know rejection sucks, but I also know that I'm not that ""special person"" for him. I usually like him a lot, but I know that we're on two separate paths. So these cases are usually nobody's fault, it's just not it the cards at the moment.

It's up to you if you want to keep your feelings going. In some cases a girl will fall for a guy AFTER having rejected him, but in some cases she wont. I'm sorry you got hurt. Rejection is never easy. But picking yourself up and moving forward (which ever way you choose) is important. It sounds like your friend probably cares about you and wants to stay friends.

One last thing I wanted to mention. If you two are pretty talkative and honest with each other, and your heart really WANTS to talk about the rejection with her, you could always tell her that you're hoping you didn't make her uncomfortable and that you really like ^[blank]  *(how funny she is, her smile, her positive attitude, etc)* about her. Also mention that she's a good friend. That usually starts a conversation or gives closure. If you do take this route, remember to only do it once because affectionate comments can come off as very creepy if done more than once by someone who likes you. You seem like a nice guy and I wish you the best of luck! "
soc_200654,socialskills,reddit_comment,297,"I know how you feel. 

I can be in conversation sometimes and on the outside I'm smiling but my inner dialogue is like ""this person is completely full of shit.""

If you want to be more conversational here's my tip. Practice paying a little more attention to what they are saying. I know it's easy to zone out and go on the ""okay"" autopilot but here's what you can do.

For example if they say, ""looks like it's going to be a nice day today."" 

Instead of saying something like ""yeah"" you can lead the conversation into something you are more interested in talking about. Like the surfing or the beach.

""Yeah, looks like a nice day to go to the beach.""


By mentioning the beach you direct the conversation and lead it into something more interesting. It also give the other person something to work with.


You can always lead a conversation no matter what the other person says, it doesn't even have to relate.

Boring Person: ""I'm so tired I just want to go to sleep.""
You: ""Last night I found two cats humping in the back yard.""

Obviously that one kinda depends on who you are talking to. But something random and self-amusing like that always sparks humour in a conversation. They will usually laugh or say ""what"".

Just make it fun, for yourself and the other person. No one likes a bland conversation.

Also talk about what you're generally interested in. 9 times out of 10 it doesn't matter what you say but rather how you say it.


Good luck.

soc_522711,socialskills,reddit_comment,240,"Self confidence is not a skill or a talent that you don’t have. 

Part of your social skills have to do with your surroundings, part how your home life is, and part your self assessment. Further all of these effect each other. 

You can control your surroundings when you get out of high-school and the same for your home life.

Your self assessment can always be controlled. 

You decided that you feel like your social skills are so bad that you need help to fit in.

We cant say for certain that the fault is yours because perhaps it is just the people that you are surrounded with. 

It might very well be that we would like you just how you are if we got to know you. 

Your self assessment after interacting with your environment is what has truly hurt your self esteem. 

We can give you tips on how to have better conversations, but you have to decide to live without putting unnecessary stress on yourself about if you are confident enough. 

I am glad you posted because self-improvement is what successful adults do.

Advice: 1. Do like 50 pushups and sit-ups every single day and do all of your homework. 2. Talk to one person you have never really talked to before at school once per day; “hey, how are you? My name is ____” counts. They may not want to talk, keep trying with other people. "

soc_1181681,socialskills,reddit_comment,218,"I have done a lot of self therapy and a lot of self reflection. My journey has definitely been a long one but I've fought through low self esteem and social anxiety. 😊 There was a time I couldn't hold a conversation with anyone at all, couldn't hold eye contact, was not comfortable with any expression of intimacy, compliments made me paranoid and now I love these things more than anything when connecting with someone so I do feel everyone holds the power to ""untangle"" themselves. I've used some self help books along the way - learning self compassion is an important one and really implementing it. Realising that we're all just human at the end of the day.

It's cliche and definitely doesn't work for everyone but a big part of understanding myself for me was figuring out my MBTI personality type. Joining facebook groups/threads for my type with loads of examples of people who could relate to me. It helped me to realise everyone is different but my strengths are unique and should be valued.

I would also add that I do not keep any social media (save for scrolling through reddit), I used to have facebook but identified that was making me more depressed from comparison and so I think social media will hamper progress."
soc_522666,socialskills,reddit_comment,588,"Currently being 24, I can tell you that the feeling of being worked up over meeting someone particularly attractive does not really fade completely. Half of the game is approaching and simply sparking off a conversation. If I told you how many of my friends have failed to initiate (when there were obvious signs of interest judging by body language) with a girl, you wouldn't believe me. Talking about missing one hundred percent of opportunity by doing nothing. The good news is the more often you do it, the less painful rejection will be and over time, you will figure out your game based on the person that you are. Not everyone processes the world in the same manner (obviously), hence, quite a few people will not fit your profile. You can fit in with everyone as long as you adapt to their mentality, however that is not something I'd recommend. Instead, use it as a tool to propel yourself forward in life. 

&amp;#x200B;

As per random new people, it is usually based on interest in my opinion. Rarely will I ever get approached but when I do, people tend to gravitate towards two things to open up random ass conversation. My glasses and my accent. I more or less do the same. I attempt to spark interest in the person and ask a few generalized questions with a laugh or two here and there to break the ice. Think recent events, each other hobbies, life aspirations, funny or even embarrassing stories. Politics may not be great due to risk in differentiation of opinion but if you get a hint they are on the same side of the fence then SEND IT. Nothing attracts people more than others who think alike. 

&amp;#x200B;

As per where to find people to talk to... when I was closer to your age, I switched schools like a maniac which helped me with adapting to and injecting myself into different circles of friends. Indeed, I was usually towards the bottom of the totem pole but I got to experience different activities and vibes with varied groups. Each group had something else to offer. If you know another group within your school or neighborhood, find an individual who associates with that group and catch them on their own. At that point, I cannot tell you what might be said. Each situation is unique. Once you get your shit together in the late teens, you will perhaps have a car to drive and you may also be allowed into langues and maybe certain clubs. Clubs are great for hook ups and meeting people without having to talk much. Its too damn loud and always crowded. What is a gold mine of potential friends and acquaintances? Leagues (APA league, cards, volleyball, mechanic) and bars my friend. In leagues people come together to take part in mutual interests. Bars are pretty obvious I recon. Just know how to defuse a situation. People sometimes only look for a fist in the face. 

&amp;#x200B;

What else... Whenever I attempted to combine groups of friends together in a mutual activity or night out, the groups separated and kept to themselves. If you want to introduce new characters into groups, you will have to keep it on individual basis. A single person is much more likely to interact and get accepted into a circle than two, three people or more. 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and observe man. Don't be a creep obviously but discreetly observe people's behaviors. Study them and patterns will emerge. "
soc_1485990,socialskills,reddit_comment,267,"I’m sorry you’re going through this. I know you desire to patch things up and have things return to normal, but this situation screams toxicity. It’s one-sided. You’re putting in extraordinary effort, she got used to not having to put in the work in return, took you for granted, and then once you reached your limit with giving her unlimited attention, kindness, and thoughtfulness, she plays the victim card which is meant to make you feel badly for stopping the attention. 

I’ve gone through this with romantic partners and friendships. 

You said yourself she puts in effort with others and gives a blanket statement (I’m struggling) to diffuse blame. Guess what: We’re ALL struggling. What about your struggles? There’s no reciprocation. This is horribly anxiety inducing and hurtful. 

This also isn’t your fault. OP, it’s not up to you to put in the effort to rebuild a relationship that she let rot and decay. You tried to breathe life into it for ages, and it didn’t seem to work. You are much better off putting that effort into making new friends, finding a new hobby, binging a new TV show, or catching up on sleep than to continue putting effort into a relationship with her. This cycle will continue if you let it. She’ll string you along with just enough attention until she’s sure you’re in her orbit again. 

I don’t mean to be pessimistic; I just want you to be protected from something that a lot of us have experienced before. Feel free to DM me if you’re still having anxiety about this. Best of luck."
soc_1122482,socialskills,reddit_comment,372,"Hiya! I definitely get where you're coming from - I'm very much the kind of person who wants to fix the problem!! There are two main things I've found that help me empathize and care when people complain to me:

Firstly, I try to think of listening to the complainer as a solution in and of itself-- what I mean by that is, instead of finding an outside solution to the problem, consider that their solution is to find someone they trust and care about to confide in. Your listening and simply being there and acknowledging that it sucks can be a solution right there,  because it reassures your conversation partner in a big way, even if nothing's actually being solved. So that can help in terms of framing it and trying to get away from seeing it as pointless.

In terms of what to do now, then, I find that a combination of active listening (which, okay, 99% of the time active listening is kind of bs but when you're receiving a vent, restating what they're saying both helps you understand where they're coming from and proves you're invested in the conversation), as well as a focus on validating their emotions is important. When people vent, I find, they're rarely looking for solutions-- they just want reassurance that either someone feels the same way they do, or the way they feel is valid/normal. So being like ""oh man I totally understand why your boss yelling at you would make you feel terrible"" can be super helpful!!

Finally, I think it could be helpful for you to put up boundaries about what you do and don't want to engage in conversation about! If someone seems like they're going to be complaining about a person, you can even say like: ""I'm grateful that you trust me enough to vent about this person, but I feel uncomfortable hearing vents about other people. What else can I do to help you feel okay right now?"" Or something like that ^.^

It's a process for sure and reframing the discussion can help, but overall it's a journey to work on empathizing and caring when you're on the receiving end of complaints and vents. You got this!!"
soc_1436578,socialskills,reddit_comment,110,"Something that’s important to realize is that, you don’t know what and how much you don’t know. Small talk can be very boring. A lot of the time, you probably have had the same conversation before. But it’s like 1) practicing something so you get better at it, and also like 2) digging for treasure. 
1) The more you practice small talk, the better you’ll get at it and the more comfortable people will become opening up to you- which will typically lead to better, more interesting conversations.
2) The more often you chit chat with people, the more likely you are to run into someone you natural “click” with."
soc_614692,socialskills,reddit_comment,146,"lol anyone who has to say the phrase ""Actually I'm pretty fucking awesome"" is definitely not pretty fucking awesome.

It sounds to me like you need some serious help. I doubt you'll take my advice, but therapy can do wonders, if not just finding someone you trust to talk to. Wallowing in your own self-pity won't make you any better, and it wont make women like you anymore. Besides, you already said your last GF pitied you and that pissed you off, so dont pity yourself. 

Clearly you have bigger problems than just bad luck with some long-term relationships, but its up to you to look deep inside yourself to find what those things are. Seeking professional help is a good way to find out how to start.

This is all assuming you aren't just a troll saying shit to get a rise out of people."
soc_1775297,socialskills,reddit_comment,218,"A supplementary advice that is less on finding a partner and more to connecting with others I wanna give is:

Don't be afraid to offer help, don't force others to accept your help, and to back away if it gets too much for you or you feel you're being taken advantage of.

Helping others, big or small, is one way you could get to know other people. Also people, for the most part, appreciates those who help them. If you keep helping them several times and maybe some small talk, you both could get to know each other to some level.

On that note, don't antagonise or pressure them into accepting your offer. It'll have a negative effect instead, make people view you in a bad light, and they may do their best to avoid you in the future.

Final part of the advice is more for your own sake. Sometimes you're gonna be unlucky and help a not so good person/people, and it might be overbearing at some point. It's up to you to determine that and if it is, then you need to solve it somehow. Don't be afraid to confront or just break off if necessary. Staying in that kind of social relationship is definitely worse for you and your mentality and belief in socialising."
soc_1365008,socialskills,reddit_comment,551,"Accepting a situation and become accommodated are different things. I know they seem like the same. I think we all made and make that normal mistake at some point.

My take is that you can accept as it is now but still work towards improving things. 

You know it's there, so eventually you need to decide what to do with it, right? The elephant on the room isn't likely going away right now, so you gotta think of a plan to get rid of it. Of course, time and effort will be needed.

Something I like to focus on when things get overwhelming, is what should be the next step now.

That's what works for me as an example, and you can tweak your methods as you want.

So acceptance means you stop freaking out and and be like ""yeah... that's a thing. Okay."" and the rest you know how to proceed. Although isn't easy. 

People need to learn to manage their emotions. So they can manage their problems better. No one really have it figured out at this age, though lol not even social people. 

I talk like this, but I'm also 23 and struggling with guilt and lack of friends.

Ironically, I was in my self loathing process when I got sick of it and opened Reddit to escape reality. Well, nobody said it was an easy or quick ride...

I recall looking at American (and others) pop culture and seeing the obsession with large social circles and your body. 

I'm glad I'm out of the loop so this bothers me less. I try to keep away from obvious triggers.

But boy If my mental state gets bad, all these real or imaginary details about my insecurities gain a disproportionately huge size start bothering me an insane amount. All I need is a bad situation to trigger old trauma. 

I believe it's happening to you, too.

Took a while to realize where all these huge expectations were coming from. People should be allowed to have problems, right?

All thanks to the people wanting to sell you stuff to fix fake problems that these corporations created. 

At least later when I manage to bounce back (thank Heavens) I realize that idgaf. Or at least not nearly as much as I thought I did. All because if social media and other ways people create petty problems about you that doesn't matter that much.

Like when Instagram made me but $70 in lipstick to unconsciously look like a model or whatever bs is pretty right now. And make me think it matters what my lip colour is when it's really a smaller issue.

But I still like lipstick, I just don't use it anymore with the purpose of a quick dopamine rush to make up for the amount of serotonin that modern culture has taken from us.

That's my experience and view, anyways. 

I like to think I'm ok living the life the way I want and not how society told me I should. So i take things on my terms and my pace.

It's hard to conciliate me with others and outside things, bit I try to keep my locus of control inside (look it up).

soc_1053534,socialskills,reddit_comment,129,"Depends. You really can't quantify what a friendship is. There are also different types of friends. Like, I have work ""friends"" that I only talk to at work then I have longer term friends that I met in high school.

The nature of the relationship can also change over time in a way that's difficult to explain. Like, in school, you'll find out as an adult that some of your friendships existed solely on a few mutal interests and proximity. Then there are people who you actually enjoy being around regardless.

So, to get to the point: It depends. You can make a friend in a few hours or a few months. It depends on the person and the situation and again, what you consider a ""friend"" to be."

There is a technical term for people who act like they know more about random stuff than anyone, and it is ""douchebag"".

In my experience, it’s best to talk to people when they’re looking for conversation. Put yourself in places were conversations happen like a bar, concert, fare, or some social gathering. Your best line is going flop if it’s abrupt and unexpected. Imagine yourself from their point of view. You going somewhere to go do something. You focused on getting your shit done. All of a sudden, someone bigger and stronger than you walks by and says cute shoes.  My first thought is you want my shoes and I’m concerned.

soc_898112,socialskills,reddit_comment,173,"I have extreme phone anxiety too. As far as i know it's not a thing you can get rid of. This is probably (research i did, i'm not a specialist) because human brains aren't made to communicate only verbally without any visuals. I agree with that because i find video calls way less unnerving than 'normal' calls.

What you can do is work on the symptoms. For example if you're restless, find a way you can do phone calls while walking around.

Another example, my mouth always gets extremely dry when i'm anxious, so my therapist told me to forget what i learned in school about stuff in your mouth while talking. She told me to learn talking with a bonbon in my mouth (no gum as you have to 'interact' with that). By now, no one can tell if i'm having a bonbon stashed in my cheek or not when i talk, but it's stimulating my mouth with taste and stuff making it produce more saliva so my mouth won't go dry."

I think a big hurdle in meeting new people is not being ok with yourself. From your post, it seems like you still have troubles confronting your past behaviors. Although joining hobby groups is a great way to meet new people, If you aren't able to open up, nothing's going to come out of it anyway. 

I would strongly encourage you to first become comfortable with yourself, especially in regards to your past. No matter how many people you meet if you aren't able to open up, you won't find the fulfillment you're looking for. There's no shame in having fallen and standing back up. You might think its none of their business, but its part of your identity. Embrace it, learn from it, don't repeat it.

If you're having trouble finding people in your life to talk to about these issues, maybe consider a therapist or a counselor. My inbox is also open if you ever want to talk about anything specific. 

If you have some time I'd encourage you to watch this [Ted Talk] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCvmsMzlF7o&amp;t=155s) by Brene Brow. It might be relevant to your situation. "
soc_1003831,socialskills,reddit_comment,393,"Oof after reading your post and your other reply explaining further I really want to say as a girl she just sounds like the kind that can't really communicate properly?
I could be reading it all wrong but it sounds similar to a situation I've been in way back.

I was sort of freshly broken up, was flirting with this guy friend, discussed maybe dating, but then (kinda mistakingly) took my ex back under the notion he changed. It was a very heat of the moment thing and I totally forgot about the prior guy. I felt real awkward but knew it would be kind of a shit move to ghost him. So I was like ""hey I got back with my ex, I'm sorry this happened when kinda had a thing, it was kind of unexpected, and you have every right to be upset and if you need space that's fine, we can talk about this when you feel comfortable, or just part ways, it's up to you"" because I was sure he'd wanna stop being my friend.

Long story short I realized what a mistake taking my ex back was and I'm dating the guy friend now and never been happier.

So yeah sounds like she's kinda childish and is operating under a ""this guy can't cope being mad in love with me that's what this confrontation is about"" and just... Ghosted you. Yeah sounds cowardly and childish to me. I get her fear, some guys DO come on too strong and don't let stuff go, but this isn't really that. This sounds like she felt guilty forgetting about plans with you, or wasn't serious about those plans like she presented, and proceeded to just.. ghost like a coward. Both of those are pretty shitty. And I woulda confronted her about it too. People need to communicate and be honest.

As for coping with the feeling, just understand some people absolutely suck at communicating, which is balls yes, BUT you did what you could and she didn't wanna even try. I'd say try your best to befriend people that can actually communicate, but for some reason that's rare in people now which is so stupid. But yeah, never feel bad for calmly communicating your feelings and thoughts, that's a good thing and the right people will come along.

Best of luck!"
soc_23620,socialskills,reddit_comment,386,"&gt;How can I tell if I'm confident? I honestly don't know. I'm sure people see me as confident but I can't seem to define it.

Confidence is all a mind game - as in, only you know if you are truly confident or not. It seems as if there might be a self-esteem issue lurking around, since from what you've said up there you seem very confident. The problem is when how you view yourself doesn't match up with what other people see. 

My advice to you would be to ""fake it 'till you make it"" - right now you're worried that you're not confident and such, but tell yourself that you are, especially before, during, and after talking with people - you have lots of reasons to be, you're sociable and you have a good career. Over time, your brain will internalize this, because it's like a habit - eventually your brain will just tell itself to be more confident and then you'll be feeling a lot more confident soon! (Granted, this process isn't instant, you know, YMMV)

&gt;How does one network? 

Networking is based on the **principle of familiarity**. That is, say a colleague needs you to help him with an assignment - would you be more willing to help him if you considered him a friend, or if he was a total stranger? Here's where striking up a conversation really comes in handy, get to know these people, and try to get to know them on some level. So, when you need to ask people for favors you'll get help.

&gt;It is better to separate business from pleasure, i.e. friendship.

On some level, this is true, but honestly, pleasure is allowed and encouraged in business relationships - if you found being with a person wasn't really pleasurable, then why would you maintain a relationship with them?

But, you have to make sure that you keep your ""business friends"" separate from your regular friends. This is a little tricky to explain, as in, a networking relationship is in the context of work/business. In a way, it's a means to an end, keep that in mind, the goal of this is to make the process of working together more pleasurable so both people can achieve their goals (i.e. to finish that assignment!).

Hope this helps."

People might say ""but I don't want to upset them.."" to that I would say: it's your choice. Either you'll be upset by talking to someone you don't want to or you will move on and improve your life.

However I also wouldn't be opposed to going on a date with someone I met from a meetup if I felt we had a mutual connection. But we would have to be friends first or at least have more than a few conversations with each other. Idk, I'm fairly demisexual so maybe this is more personal preference?

soc_1103814,socialskills,reddit_comment,562,"As a parent, I’d like to weigh in here. My sons live with me—their father is in another state and visits a handful of times a year. My sons spend anywhere from 5-9 days each visit and though they live with me the rest of the time, I do speak with them almost every day they are with their father. Usually it’s either a short 4-5 minute phone call saying hi and telling me about their day or it’s a few texts doing the same. Most often it’s just to say ‘hi, thinking of you, love you, have a good day.’ My sons are I are very close and we maintain that closeness by doing things together like cooking dinner, playing a board game, bingeing a favourite show and sometimes just hanging out and talking. And when we aren’t together, it’s those short phone calls or texts. When they aren’t here, I do appreciate a few days of the alone time, but often after 3 days, I become lonely. I don’t tell them this, and I deal with it by keeping myself busy, but those little phone calls and texts mean everything to me.

When you have a relationship with someone, no matter the kind, it takes work on both ends. It’s not there just to satisfy your needs—you have to put in as much as you take out. Sometimes it won’t always be a 50-50 effort—life happens and the give and take becomes 60-40 or 20-80, etc., and if the relationship is one that means something to you, you continue to work at it until you both find your rhythm again.

There are those who can go for weeks without talking and they are ok with it. There are those whom need more. It’s about finding a balance both sides can live with. 

With a parent, keep in mind that for the first 18 years of your life, (on average), your presence was a constant and adjusting to life without you there is hard and it’s frightening and it’s lonely and it takes some time to get used to. Sometimes parents will hold on a little too tightly, so just offer the reassurance that they are still loved and still needed and maybe try to set up a routine where you call on Sunday mornings and will send a thinking of you text on Wednesdays and a TGIF text on Fridays or whatever works for you. It sounds boring, yes, but it also alleviates some of that fear and anxiety and they’re able to let go and give you more breathing room.

Just think of the people in your life and how much they mean to you and what they are like and what kind of relationship you want to have with them. Then offer some sort of compromise and find your balance.

Trust me, when you enter into your 40’s, you start to give a good, hard look at the relationships in your life, both past and present, and one of the biggest regrets you start facing is how much time and effort you put into the relationships in your life. Sometimes the regret is about having put in too much, but usually on the wrong people—but with those whom honestly mean something to you, the regret is usually not putting in enough.

soc_430574,socialskills,reddit_comment,348,"Is it bipolar 1 or bipolar 2?
As far as I'm aware, bipolar 1 has the auditory hallucinations (voices).

I learned this with one of my exes.

If it weren't for the situation where she wanted kids and I didn't (which could happen to anyone), we would still be together.

Notice the ONE reason that separated us.

Not her bipolar disorder or schizoaffective symptoms. That doesn't bother me, unless it gets in the way of the fulfilling things and romance in a relationship (example, I have flowers sent to you and you receive them at a certain time and then you assign some supernatural or spiritual meaning behind it and assume I have psychic abilities to read your mind or connect with you through the universe to somehow know that time meant something to you, making you assign a completely alternative meaning to my gesture and taking away from the true meaning I had behind trying to do something to show you you're special to me).

So, don't avoid relationships or giving yourself a chance based on the fear that people will run away just because you've been labeled for operating and behaving and thinking differently. You never know who will accept you if you always run with the assumption you won't be accepted.

It is also a known fact that women who are considered ""weird"" have their weirdness overlooked and are given a chance way more than a man who might even come across as slightly weird. Therefore, I would use this advantage to your advantage.

Lastly, keep in mind that whatever you can imagine, there is either a fetish or an attraction for that thing by someone in the world. Therefore, whatever you think your worst quality is, there is someone somewhere in the world who will be drawn to it and see it as your ""perfect imperfection.""  So, do not believe any false cliche quote or sayings, like ""you must love yourself before anyone can love you,..."" Etc. Whether or not you love yourself does not alter or change another person's natural attraction to you.

What ever I write, it is up to you how you take it. So first thing you have to do is to lower your expectations( yea I know you know that,) their is no one born perfect, neither you nor me( not being rude😊) you shouldn’t leave your friends because they are imperfect you should make them more dear to you and try to make them a *perfect* being. But remember don’t taunt them, don’t shout at them, because they are your friends. They are going to help you in difficult times, they will be first to accompany you, give you all the positives during your hard times. Just respect them as a human, find common interest, and build a long lasting relationship and friendship. Also these years of your life are never going to come back again, it shouldn’t be the case that while looking at your past as you are In your later stages of life you regret these things.( yeah I know what a piece of crap I have written 😅) have a good day and best of luck😊😊"
soc_329416,socialskills,reddit_comment,203,"Hey awesome post! I agree that standing up for your values and being assertive are very important traits. I struggle a lot with voicing my opinions when I thought someone would disagree too. I had one caveat to add (although I think this is what you meant anyways ;) ). 

Be assertive, but don't assume people are out to get you. In your ""Why are you vegetarian?"" example, someone could be genuinely curious about your situation (and you) and it's often best to give them the benefit of the doubt. Another good way to approach this is to give a confident response that shows you're comfortable with your choice of being a vegetarian (and the values you hold associated with being a vegetarian). ie. ""I used to eat meat until I discovered how the modern agricultural industry treats animals like shit. I still miss the taste of nice juicy steak sometimes but I'd never go back."" This keeps you guys on the same side because it's relatable and people will naturally respect you for being proud of and confident in what you believe in. If they still attack you after that then they're an asshole and you can start putting up the gloves."
soc_324423,socialskills,reddit_comment,109,"I'm glad to hear that:)

About feeling awkward, you just have to not care how you sound (I know, easier said than done but still) because when you commit to being you it is a bit of a leap of faith. People may not like it. That is a possibility. But if you are truly being genuine than you don't have anything to apologize to those people for or feel bad about. Maybe it just shows you that you and them aren't compatible. In my opinion it's better to learn that and part ways than compromise being genuine to keep on good terms with others. Hope that makes sense."
soc_1150012,socialskills,reddit_comment,319,"Yeah, first off:
Don’t worry about other people judging you, here’s why. Even if they do “judge” you, it wouldn’t matter, because it’s inaccurate. Do they know you 100%? Only you do. NEXT, is it even right to judge? We think no usually, and here’s why. It is hypocritical if I were to judge you, to point something wrong about you when I have something wrong myself, and I didn’t point that out. We know somethings wrong with them because nobody’s perfect.

How do we make conversation? Nobody really teaches this stuff, it weird. Here’s how I see it. The golden rule. 

What do you want when a person is your friend, or what makes you decide that that’s your friend? Maybe they make you laugh, or give you a genuine compliment. The point is, do you give them service first, because you want it back, or because that’s the person you are? People who get those things usually find it easier to give it back anyway.

To make friends, you really have to know yourself. Maybe you could try to self reflect. You know, what are you interested in, what do you value, how much do you value it, how do you feel about it?(seriously) Once you know that, share it with others like a trophy, and others will be willing to share theirs with you, especially because you did it first. The good friends share theirs, support yours, and connect them together because a good bond connects as much as possible.

But it’s your choice, are you strong enough to go first? Many people aren’t, and they lose out. Regret it even as far as after high school. I think this is your opportunity to help others by making it easier for them to share themselves. Know yourself first, then share it because it gives them that opportunity.

Ask more questions, comment, I’d like to answer more"

I think if you ask her straight up, she will lie just to keep you on the hook. Instead, tell her that this situation is not working for you. Tell her to leave you alone. Then block her on skype, facebook, everything. If she does contact you somehow, ignore her. This doesn't make you a 'cold bitch'. You're cutting out someone who doesn't show that she cares about you.

soc_386777,socialskills,reddit_comment,405,"I've supervised plenty of therapists with strong personalities who either didn't like authority much, didn't like having someone with my demographics as a boss, and a combination of both.

I had to learn very quickly that the qualities and skills that make me a good therapist are not necessarily ones that will make me a good boss.  

Some important lessons I learned/techniques I apply now having made many mistakes as a supervisor in the past:

1.  Remind yourself often that although you may be a friendly person you are not your supervisees friend.  You do not need their approval.  You need their respect and need them to do their job.  

2.  Praise the employees that are doing well publically and often while talking to problematic employees in private (specifically mandatory meetings you set up with them.)

3.  Before making a decision regarding policy/procedure changes, strategy to complete a project, etc.  listen to everyone, take  their opinions into consideration.  Once you make your decision, the path is no longer up for debate.  You can straight up say this in whatever language you feel comfortable.  Just be sure that you are assertive with it.  If a supervisee questions your authority publically, either call them into your office or say something like ""That's not up for discussion now.  You and I can talk about that later."" 

4.  When you call a supervisee to meet with them about issues you are having with them, document it.  This is probably the most important take away I learned in my first few years of supervising.  Be very clear, concrete, and specific about what the employee said or did (or multiple things if applicable along with the corresponding dates) and if possible, how it either goes against a specific company policy or specific part of their job description.  Write on the document what areas you need to see specific concrete improvement by and a deadline for follow up.  Have him sign it.  If he refuses, schedule a meeting with your supervisor to discuss a plan of action.

This is what has worked for me.  It's not going to work for everyone in every situation but I think it may be helpful to you.  With a guy like this, you need to be the leader, or before long, your other co-workers will lose respect for you or this guy is going to end up being your boss.  

Best of luck!

soc_232634,socialskills,reddit_comment,244,"I'm sorry to hear that! I'm not gonna tell you it's easy starting out, because it's not, but it is *simple*.

The biggest thing I'd suggest to anyone in your situation is to start exercising a lot. Not to make you look better (though that aspect doesn't hurt), but to make you feel better. A really remarkable number of guys I talk to who improved their dating life a lot point to exercise as the biggest catalyst. Check out r/fitness, and get going as soon as possible-- don't get bogged down with information.

Beyond that, dive into things that interest you and stimulate your mind/body. Examples:

* hiking
* computer programming
* beer brewing
* painting
* building websites (I am doing this right now, it's been really fun and is super easy to get started with, hit me up if you want some advice with this)
* volunteering at an animal shelter

Bonus points if you start going to do these activities with other people/ talking to people who are also interested in them.

As soon as you're ready to, make a profile on several dating apps/ sites. Check out the articles I've written on this at http://datingappsdemystified.com for help on setting up profiles. These are super important, it's worth investing some effort into getting them right.

Once you get to that point, start asking out a lot of girls! You'll learn and get better at this like any other skill.

Good luck!"
soc_289616,socialskills,reddit_comment,191,"Well business investing isn't going to help you're emotional state. I'd keep searching for self-help literarure. It's hard to recommend any books because I'm not 100% what you're dealing with but there are general books that could help like anything by Brene Brown or Kristen Neff. Kristen Neff's Self-Compassion is pretty great.

As far as therapy, many people aren't lucky enough to connect with the first therapist they meet. I'd keep meeting with different therapists until you find the right one. This is probably your best most direct route.

At the end of they day, for change to occur we must be open with ourselves. We must be open to change. We must be willing to change. We must be honest with ourselves. We must be ready to talk or at least learn. 

If you look within yourself and feel as though youre sick of living the way you are and feeling how you feel, than it seems well worth it to keep searching and trying new things. Just my opinion. I wish you well on your journey. Peace to you. Hopefully you can stumble across something, or have an epiphany."

Idk man, being over-weight, acne ridden, broke, and short are unattractive qualities in men (those are the qualities of the guys I knew) but that doesn't mean they are excluded from anything. Sure, they might not have as large of a pool to select from like a movie star, but they aren't shit outta luck. It's up to them whether or not they are hopeless. I know what you see on the internet are girls having modol-tier boyfriends, but when you go outside in public like a city, you WILL SEE couples where the guy looks better than the girl or the girl looks better than the guy.

We actually had a little conversation AND he answered to my message from yesterday that he did not even read until my message this morning. Wasn't expecting that last bit.

A bit later I put in my status that i am watching the second part of the race. He answered to that with ""yeah with (insert his nickname) who is a bit under the weather (that is what google said the translation is. Like not feeling that well when you feel you get a cold)""

While i was typing to give himself until the race is on (as he told me it got pretty laye last night) to get better, he sent a selfie. He looked really tired, and I asked if he feels like that because it got late or in general. Answered ""we'll see"" to my first message and ""both"" on my second question. I proceeded to ask if he feels like that from the overall situation or his body as in ""do you feel like you're about to get a cold?"" which he read but did not answer to.

I guess as you mentioned he needs my support but it the same time is not entirely sure how far to open up? That conversation felt a bit like he needs a little pity and compassion/sympathy from me and kind of an opportunity/safe place to not be the strong man.

soc_1211600,socialskills,reddit_comment,212,"It depends on your friend dynamic. If you two are that close where you dont mind your friends taking your food without permission or vice versa then it might be something to not stress about. However it clearly is bothering you so that can’t be the case. 
I would let your friend know that even if you aren’t finishing your food you still plan on saving it for when you’re hungry later in the day (if that’s something you would like to do). If you plan on just throwing the food away then just give it to your friend. 
There may be a bigger issue here as to why your friend never buys food for themselves. Are they having financial issues or just being stingy and expects you to always leave your food? 
You are not responsible for providing your friend with a meal. 
Like I said, I would just begin to tell them you want to save your food for when you decide to eat it later. If they have a problem with that then maybe there’s another conversation you need to have with them or something else going on in their lives.
No one should feel that entitled especially if it’s bothering you. A simple conversation can fix it all."
soc_245249,socialskills,reddit_comment,189,"I hate most of this advice.

Here's two things I would do in your situation.
---
1.  Prepare BEFORE the gathering.  Have answers to the common questions you'll get -- what do you think about &lt;insert current event&gt;?  What's new in your life?  How's the job/gf/etc?  Having canned answers will help.   Practice is the difference between sustained success and luck.

---
2) Do a social skills ""workout"".

If you wanted to get stronger, what would you do?  You start lifting weights. You'd lift weights that were heavier than you needed to use in everyday life, so that when you were in a situation where you needed strength, you'd have it.

Well, you're trying to get better at being the in the spot light at family gatherings.  So go be the in the spotlight away from the family, by doing standup comedy or improv.  

You'll see results fast.  And, when you get become the center of attention at family gatherings, you'll be a lot more ready to handle it, smoothly.

Just my two cents -- but they're both action steps that you could start right now to see results.

But the way you have laid it out here comes off as snobbish. Because not all intelligent people are also socially inept. And also not all people who struggle socially are intelligent. These traits are not mutually exclusive. 

Perhaps that’s why people have a hard time relating. Maybe just post with your struggles socially and leave your “intelligence” out of it? If that makes sense?"

I agree with others that you would benefit from seeing a therapist regularly because they can give you that perspective in a safe environment.

soc_176525,socialskills,reddit_comment,667,"Okay, so your line sounds really cheesy at best, and I can easily imagine it coming off as creepy.  Basically, it would have to be one or the other — if you didn't deliver it as a cheesy line, then you delivered it as a creeper line.  So from the little I know, I would guess that your approach was clumsy and would not have been well-received by anyone.  But that doesn't mean the girls didn't overreact.  I had a girl explode on me like that once, and it wasn't my fault at all.  My friend and I were standing at the bar chatting with two girls who were sitting down, and my friend was doing pretty well. The girl I was talking to got really irritated and started yelling at me and then tried to tell the bartender I was creeping on her.  The bartender just rolled her eyes and walked away.  Her friend was pissed at her because her friend wanted to keep talking to my buddy.  I was pretty sure I hadn't crossed any lines, and I looked around and didn't see anybody except this girl who was pissed at me, everybody seemed irritated with her, so I just shrugged it off.  She was just being shitty, maybe because she wanted to get picked up on but didn't want to get picked up on by a guy like me.  It was still a pretty shocking and embarrassing experience, though, because it was a quiet and well-lit bar, so naturally everybody looked over and saw me getting shrieked at and called a creep.

In your case, her friend backed her up, but sometimes that's just what friends do.  I would say you should assume a reasonable person would have responded negatively to the way you approached them, but that their reaction was **way** out of proportion to your mistake.  

I have no idea what the girls on the other side of the bar were doing.  I assume they saw you get yelled at and were giving you a hard time about it, whether in a friendly or unfriendly way I don't know.  Keep in mind that after being publicly humiliated like that, you were probably not in the right state of mind to interpret their actions objectively.  I think you should just chalk it up to something you won't ever figure out because your experience and memory of it was warped by what happened immediately prior.  You should seriously consider the possibility that their original intention was just to tease you about it a little bit.  If so, it was a clumsy move on their part because they should have seen that you were not receptive to teasing, but at least it would mean they didn't wish you ill.

Also I agree 100% with /u/Flmir about you sounding angry and misogynistic, and about your choice of word to describe these girls.  Passing over the issue of whether the word ""whore"" really has a proper use as an insult, why would you apply it to these girls?  Let's say they were rude, unfair, thoughtless, and cruel.  Why use the word ""whore"" to express that?  Why automatically blame a woman's bad behavior on her sexuality?  It makes you sound like you have a problem with women's sexuality in general.  I know I'm probably not going to get anywhere by making an idealistic argument here, but look at it completely pragmatically:  how are you going to get women in bed if they can see that you feel uncomfortable with their sexual desires and sexual behavior?  They're going to choose a man who can handle it, who doesn't see it as an issue, who doesn't start calling women ""whores"" every time his ego takes a knock.

Realize that if you show up, be yourself, you've done your job. Everything after that - rejection, etc. is out of your hands. If she doesn't want to know you, then just move on, you've done nothing wrong.

Not a problem. Own it. 

&gt; Maybe there's a reason she's lonely (maybe she isn't a nice person?)

You'll find out pretty soon. Most likely she's has insecurities that can be difficult to deal with, but it can work if she feels she can open up to you (if you're open and sincere with her). 

&gt; What are some ways I could approach this girl?

Just a suggestion, but text her (e.g. through facebook), tell her you've noticed her and interested in meeting her for lunch. Otherwise try look for some kind of invitation, see if you can get eye contact with her first and then approach. Going in ""cold"" will always feel awkward, no way around that, just realize the awkwardness will be completely normal... be comfortable with that. Don't do any pickup lines or anything like that, I'd just ask her out, and then leave.

Finally, you're probably going to have the tendency to want to rush things forward... just take it slow and have patience. You'll learn to trust yourself in the process. "

These are all things that make up attractiveness, just as much as having the washboard abs or the perfectly chiseled jaw. For most women, they are far more interested in those factors that are under your control (how physically fit and well-kept you keep yourself, how confident and kind that you are) than the factors that aren’t."

I believe what you read has much more impact than you gave it credit for so actually enforcing this rule make life easier for the followers of the sub, especially those fighting with self confidence problems. Which, I imagine a lot here.


Now, is that censorship? Yeah, kind of. But this is not enforced in every subreddit, and if I want to see that kind of content, I can always subscribe to subreddits such as me_irl. So, this basically boils down to choice of moderators. Censoring it makes sense, but not censoring it makes sense as well. This is personal choice."

I mean, it seems that you broke up with him two years ago, yet you're having his baby now, way after the breakup.  You do know how he feels about you - he doesn't care about you nearly to the level you care about him.  He was your first, but he doesn't have to be all you know of love.  Better love will come if you don't shut yourself off from it by reliving the past.

soc_1410110,socialskills,reddit_comment,336,"Don’t give up. I was 22 when I met my future wife, I was in the Military: My duties were in the Infantry and I was a NCO. It was love at first sight. Then I found out she had a 5 year old son. Talk about hitting the brakes. 
We were friendly and acquaintances for the next 18 months because I didn’t believe I was ready to be a father. Specially after growing up in a toxic broken house and being used by both parents to hurt one another by send me to live with the other and then being sent back again at 11 &amp; 15, it destroyed my self esteem. I had to work really hard at being a man able to stand up for myself and lead men in a combat environment. 
Alas, there came a day when I realized I want a life with her and would take that responsibility of raising another man’s child as my own. 
Here is the kicker. I took her on one date with her son, to the State fair. I asked her to marry me at the end of the date, she said yes. We married two weeks later. She got her first kiss from me the day of our Wedding, an hour before our ceremony. We’ve been faithfully married for over 33+years. We had two more a son and a daughter and I adopted her son as my own. Like I said I waited and waited until I found someone I was willing to take a chance on. She took a chance on me too. If you are yourself and be honest with everyone life can take you places you never expected. 
It takes honesty with yourself to see your potential, we all have loads of potential, it’s up to you how you use it and how you wish to live. It’s your choice, choose well and have a vision for your life. Now go out there and make all your dreams come true"

One of my friends I've known since I was 12 and I'd say it wasn't until we were 16-17ish that we REALLY opened up to each other. At first there was a lot of judgment, jealousy, and general tension due to past situations we were in. But over time, we've grown to understand the situations and each other and gained a stronger bond through respect and friendship. So now, if he or I need to talk, we just do. 

Like some of the other comments say, they could simply be shitty listeners or don't know how to process emotional/supportive responses. But if my friend opened up with ""hey man, I really need help with this situation"", I'm not going to be an ass about it.

Again, like some of the other comments say, I'd just speak to my closest friend first. You respect their opinion the most anyway, that's why they're your best friend. "
soc_799856,socialskills,reddit_comment,165,"Self-reflection is problem solving and shouldn't stop at identifying the problem. Identify the problem, break it down to find the causes, brainstorm solutions to change your situation, and pursue the best solution. Self-Loathing happens when you care more that you have a problem than you care to fix it.

If you can't find the right path in life, analyze why the paths you tried didn't work out. Break it down to its characteristics. Define what you are looking for and pursue it. Even the worst paths provide useful information towards finding a better path in life.

There is nothing wrong with messing up or having issues you need to work out; however, the moment you tell yourself there's no point in trying is when you really need to get out of your head and find a reason to better yourself. In the end, you're responsible for the things that happen to you and it is up to you to carve out a future for yourself."
soc_993246,socialskills,reddit_comment,233,"There's a lot of good advice here on how to approach it, so instead I'd like to offer some insight on what to expect from the perspective of a white guy who was raised by an older father (50+ when I was born), who himself was raised before the Civil Rights Era.

There may be a tactful way of communicating what you hope, but hon... be prepared to lose their good graces for even pointing out their racist behaviors. Regardless of how you word it, the odds are that they will take it as an attack on their character rather than you opening a discussion. They may even attempt to redirect fault to you, saying you're ""too sensitive"", and """"it's just a joke"". 

This has been my experience dealing with many older whites when calling them out on racist behaviors, and believe me... It's not worth tiptoe-ing around. They know what they're doing even though they might deny it. They will try to explain away their behavior instead of accepting they're in error.

Coming from someone who disowned his own father over even more egregious behaviors, **don't trade your dignity for the sake of a relationship.** Make sure that the BF's values line up with yours, and prepare that he might not have your back. It's up to you to decide what that means for you. Sending hugs, and wishing you good luck."

If I see something I like or someone does something nice, I just say so. I find that when someone gives me a compliment it often makes my day, so if I have an appropriate opportunity to do this for someone else it makes me really happy. 

Things that work: 
- short and sweet, perhaps going into too much detail with someone you don’t know well can sometimes be a little too intimate but again really up to you and how you interact
- start off with cool, nice, or any descriptive term and then what you’re complimenting “cool shoes!” 

It can be hard to make the first few compliments but just be true to yourself, say what you mean, and it’ll be so rewarding. Feel like it has improved my confidence a lot too and I’m no longer afraid to say “girlll cool outfit!!” at another girl I see on the street even 😌😌"

For all you know, it may have absolutely nothing to do with you and the amazing person you are.

Yes, it's hard to believe that when this particular situation happened more than once, but there are so many wonderful (and sadly, completely crappy) people in this world to let a few dictate how interesting you are. I think it's so brave of you to approach new people openly and share yourself beyond face value. It's a lovely thing (that can be painful at times) to be able to do. The awful truth is that no one can make someone care or be genuine. It's up to them to decide what they what to project to the world and it's up to you to decide how you let that affect you.

soc_106533,socialskills,reddit_comment,218,"Congratulations, that sounds like it went really well! One thing I'd like to say-and I understand that you sort of regretted it afterwards- but new friends, dates, and significant others can be great opportunities to try new things or things you previously weren't totally open to. You say you don't like wine, and so it's for the best in that moment that you were honest and didn't just drink it down. But if you continue to date this girl and she's a fan of wine, tell her you're interested in learning to like it--only if you really are interested! If you aren't, then forget it. But new people in your life can always provide great opportunities to open yourself up to something you didn't previously enjoy, and in turn make you more open-minded (and potentially cultured, depending on what it is). Plus (of course this is all just my opinion) I personally really admire and sometimes am even attracted to seeing someone move out of their comfort zone to try something new; I think it can say a lot about someone and how adventurous or open they are to new things. 

Regardless of all that, congratulations! You did well and it sounds like you've got a charming catch who is very interested in you. Don't sweat a thing!"

Do you think maybe you're putting all your energy into something, and neglecting other aspects of your life?

To summarize: spread your effort, whether that's school, family, friends, a SO, a sport, is up to you. Get out of you ""flow"", force yourself to do different things.

1) Slouching
2) Keeping my arms and body folded inward and crossing my arms. Generally showing body language that is self protective rather than open.
3) Eyebrows that are shaped on such a way that I often look sad or afraid.
4) Furrowed brows.
5) Expressions of fear (raised eyebrows, slanting eyes, pained expression, wide open eyes).
6) Frowning.

This isn't to say that a person can't simply be themselves. It's just that people misinterpret stuff, and sometimes we do unconsciously show our fears in our expressions and body language. It's really ok.

I think that's more accurate than the ""Don't take things personally."" I used to take things personally and suffered from it. Then, I started not taking things personally and suffered from it too (the idea of keeping hurting yourself saying it's not personal, when it is). Ideally it's best to know clearly what the other person mean, but when this is not possible: whether you take it personally or not is about knowing the risks, outcomes and tradeoffs and make a choice.

Can I give you a piece of advise? This worked for me and hope may work for you too.

1) Gratitude is your best friend. I have read this in a book and somehow forgot about it until  l’ve watch Big Mouth in Netflix and reminded me to be grateful whatever you are going through.

2) Talk to your wife and tell her what is going on with you mentally and spiritually. Communication is key in marriage. 

3) I have read before in this sub about self negative talk. I too struggle with this, I felt that everyone is talking about me blah blah. But I learned that nobody gives a fuck about me and knowing this is liberating. My motto at work is I don’t give a fuck whatever you think of me. I am the master of my life and I can do whatever the fuck i want. 

4) Chill! Meditate and do the gratitude early in the morning or before going to bed. Practice your breathing. You are never alone. 

This is coming from a 31 year old who doesn’t have any close friends and told my wife over the weekend that i lost my will to live. I only have my wife and my kid and this is enough for me to still be here. Everyday is a struggle but here I am still breathing and slowly moving forward.

Hang in there bud you can get out of this."
soc_1405124,socialskills,reddit_comment,524,"I read your story, and well I don't say anything new, is sad. 

It was a time when I had some kind of suicidal thoughts to, but I didn't take any suicidal attempt, because I to affraid to do it.

One of the things that helped me, was to read the Bible. Since I was a kid, I went to church with my mom, but when I started to read the Bible, I somehow my perspective of life changed, and slowly my suicidal thoughts disappeared. 

I recommend you to start reading to. Maybe you heard it already, and you think that it wouldn't help, but at least try it. You don't have much to loose if you try I guess. But is your decision after all. 

And another tip, is to try to indentify what cause the suicidal thoughts. 

For me, one of the causes I was aware, it was my parents. They loved me and so on, but they did some things, that I hated. They didn't do it conciously. For exemple they were arguing so much some days, that I didn't want to stay home. They sweared,  howled, and some times even hit each other. 

But another cause of my thoughts was that I masturbated daily. I didn't realized this, just until I tried to stop. If you watch porn or masturbate, even if not daily, I suggest you to stop, is hard but is important. 
What is the connection between this and my suicidal thoughts. After you watched porn or masturbated you feel ashamed. When you are afraid you will have anxiety (in my case at least). When you have anxiety you can't communicate with others. If you realise this, you get angry on yourself. And you may watch some self-confidence bullshit on the internet. (Most of the videos are bullshit, and fake) . You realize that you can't do this things in real life, and you give up. But you are still angry on yourself, and with time you start to hate yourself. And combine this, with some family problems that you can't resolve, and you have it. And what you do to deal with your family problems, you masturbate and you watch porn, because it give you good feelings for the moment, just like a drug. 

After I started to read the Bible, I realized that there is someone, who always love me (God), and I understand what are the things I should and shouldn't do. And I stopped masturbating. After this my anxiety decreased, and I started to reconnect with the old friends, I socialised more, started to pray more (with time I prayed daily), I studied more seriously, and in  summer I went to gym (now I don't have enought time to go to gym) 

And the family problems, well there are bad days and good days,  and I deal with it. 

I tell my story, and I hope it will help you. Also still to this day,  I am doing some bad things time to time, but I try to be a good christian, but no I am not perfect.

Since he helicopter'd you, it's up to you to learn. From now on, when you see something that you think everyone knows or that you'd like to learn, make a note of it and try it. See if you're interested in it. If you are, start actively learning and applying it. If not, get a base knowledge and move on. You have to find out what you like. I don't think I knew what I liked until my mid-twenties. It takes experimenting. The more you learn and find what you like, the more confidence you'll get and the more inspired you'll be talk about it in social situations. I firmly believe that social skills improve the more you learn about things and yourself. Think about someone you think is likeable - chances are, they're self-aware, actively interested in things, and knowledgable about what they like and possibly what they don't like.    


I used to play League of Legends and remember loving to play it. Eventually though I felt like I was wasting my life, so I started trying other hobbies. If I practiced guitar for 30 minutes, exercised and tried other hobbies that were difficult at the beginning, then I'd reward myself with a game or two of LoL. It takes self-control at the beginning, but eventually, it becomes a habit and you won't be able to go a day without being productive.  


Last thing, you're not behind. As you get more confident, you'll see that the people you thought were competent aren't as competent as you originally thought. So be comfortable with the humiliation and laugh at yourself, it's the first step in learning."

It's nice to do it every now and then, it makes you look social and gains you respect. I suppose what I'm saying is that you shouldn't beat yourself up about choosing either option, both are valid, it's the kind of choice where you can be selfish and do what you feel, don't be a people pleaser.

soc_180182,socialskills,reddit_comment,486,"You should pause between each word. Not a big pause, but just long enough that each word gets its own separation. 

When it comes to being articulate, there are 2 things you need to work on... consonants and vowels. 

When working with consonants, you want to chew on them, over-emphasize them. We can do this with a few of the more obvious consonants: B, D, and P. 

Make the P sound. You should make a little explosion of air. Par. Point. Pass. Pail. Parable. Problem. Poppy. You feel the moment when your two lips come together, and then the P kind of implodes out, right? 

Now, do it to the extreme. Make the P pop! 

Do this with your main consonants. T, D, P, B. These all have full glottal stops which make them very noticeable in words.

Think about it this way, could you mumble through an M or an N? Mommy? Even if you mumble it... still sounds like Mommy.
 
Now mumble through Daddy. You can't do it. The mumbled version doesn't sound at all like the clear version. 

Now we work on the vowels. Vowels are also super important, and you need to elongate them. Probably more than you are used to. 

Day. Gray. Moon. Town. Apple. Sweet. 

Try saying all of these words and emphasizing the vowels, stretch them out just a little bit longer in your mouth than usual (heh heh) 

If you do a few of these things, you should at least be able to notice what some of these words sound like in your mouth and what they are making your mouth do. At this point, it's just up to you to keep working on them to make sure that you aren't mumbling, but going over every consonant and elongating every syllable. 

Now, here are some tongue twisters. These saying are specifically designed to be hard to say, because they make you move your tongue or mouth in a way that is hard and frustrating. You usually end up mumbling over these lines after a while. You just need to say them slowly so you understand every consonant and then try to say it faster and faster with the same emphasis on clarity. 

Here are some examples: 
Red Leather, Yellow Leather (just repeat) 

She sells sea shells by the sea shore. 

I slit a sheet, a sheet I slit, upon a slitted sheet I sit. 

You know I love unique New York. 

And my favorite: 

Hello! 

I am a pheasant plucker. 

I pluck mother pheasants. 

(now you say this last one as fast as you can) 

I am the most pleasant mother pheasant plucker that has ever plucked a mother pheasant. 

You work on all that, and within a few weeks no one will say you are mumbling anything.

soc_1826257,socialskills,reddit_comment,191,"&gt;it’s time for him to grow up

First of all you have to ditch this mindset. You are not his parent. It's really not up to you to decide how he should live his life and this judgmental attitude will only sabotage any requests you have (see the defensive part) because you come across as an asshole.

Focus purely on his actions and how those affect you, never on his mindset/mentality. 1) You want to live in a clean house, 2) which is made impossible by his mess, 3) therefore he needs to clean after himself in a reasonable time. Whether he's grown up or not is irrelevant as long as he performs the action.

What's the 3rd roommate's attitude in all of this? Do they also pressure the messy person or do they not care about the mess? If they also want the place to be cleaner but avoid confrontation, you should encourage them to speak up so it's clear to the messy person it's 2v1. In the second case you might be out of luck as it's 1v2 and it might be better to look for a different place."

I have a friend I barely speak with because she always tries guilting me to go out with her. Yet when she moved out of the country, I spoke with her constantly because I knew it would never lead to plans. 

Just keep in mind that everyone is different and not all people are as social as you. If you message someone and they reply (even if it takes days or weeks) then they WANT to talk to you. If they constantly turn down plans, that might just mean they don’t want to go out but it’s not personal to you. 

Again, if they reply and have a conversation with you, they like you. Keep that friendship alive by initiating contact and throw in plans to meet every once in a while. Group plans are the best since they won’t feel pressured to go but love that you invited."

I think that in a sense, since you don't interact or provide a means of interacting with you it makes them feel less secure because that's how normal people go about trusting people, feeling uncomfortable is a more general feeling than trust but trust is a part of it.

It's up to you to change that, and it's probably going to be hard right now since the first judgements have already cemented the image of you in their memory. Not impossible though.

Save things to do would include asking them for specific help with something that they are able to help you with, asking for an opinion that you know they are opinionated about and being interested in them or helping them with something when they need help, however for the last one only do it if they really struggle or it seems sollicited because you don't want them to wonder why you're helping them.
Humor is also a way to improve your situation but then you can fall in the trap of not being taken seriously ever again."
soc_128013,socialskills,reddit_comment,138,"It’s really up to you on how much info you provide. I’m a very private person, so I don’t really have any personal info on my profile at all, I only have 1 or 2 photos, and I never post anything whatsoever about my personal life. Only occasionally have I posted a few interesting tech articles, and that’s it. 
I mainly use if for chat/messaging to friends (which is a great tool!), browsing other people’s profiles, and the occasional event invite. 

You can also set up approvals for tagging, so posts or photos that people tag of you, will only go on your profile if you manually approve it. As well as other security settings to further lock down what people can see. With all that in mind, I don’t really see a reason ‘not’ to have one.

soc_1515638,socialskills,reddit_comment,469,"I don't have any social media. I only use WhatsApp... reddit and youtube. I don't really have a lot of friends. Maybe you're even true. But, before, I had a lot of online friends and it didn't really help me in feeling less lonely.
For me social media can go fuck itself. As dating apps can. And reddit can. (I'm a hypocrite).Maybe internet as a whole can. I hate being forced to always be connected with everyone and I hate the mentality that ""there's just an ocean full of fish"". I feel like it puts more pressure on you, it doesn't really contribute in connecting with people, and it's by far not the same thing as having a fisical relationship and it doesn't give you any social improvement. I hate, now, when people expect me to have a real conversation with them on WhatsApp, for example. An useless change of informations or jokes no one cares about in the form of ha ha s (not really laughing). If you want to talk, we go out and talk, and use our full spectrum of body language. Nothing is so important that can't wait. And I don't need to see your ugly face every single moment of the day. If I want to see it, I'll take you on a date and if I want to know what you've been doing, I'll just ask you, instead of seeing it in your feed. It takes from the exclusivness, uniqueness, authenticity, etc. of the relationships (I'm here, with you, I give you all of my attention and time and I don't have any other private conversation with anyone at the same time, as I'm also watching a movie and listening to music, alone, in my 6 square room.). I'm nostalgic for the times before all this shit. Social media by far just alienated people making them lonelier. 
I remember of this girl I could talk to only in text. It was so funny. I could not find anything to talk about with her in person, ever, but we'd talk for hours when talking in text. Guess what. We never really became real friends, lol. 
Idk. You always have to lose by not conforming, but it's stupid. It's like throwing yourself in a pit just because everyone is doing it. I feel like people don't really have strong, deep, relationships anymore. Personal space is as important as investment in a relationships and social media takes them both from you. It's at least how I feel. They can be useful when there's an emergency, but how often emergencies really happen? That's why there was no life on earth before social media. Oh, wait, there was. Even if they couldn't answer to emergencies in a time lapse of secondo. But idk. I can't say what's better."

Plenty of people your age and older just follow others social media accounts just because they go to the same school.

Be kind in person if you see her give a quick smile or a how are ya? If you have the opportunity to hold the door for her or anything in that region of politeness without coming off as obsessed you’ll be fine.

Tbh, you dont need to do much. Something small everyday would litteraly move mountains. I personally just try taking care of my body because fuck if i know how to take care of anything else.

Make sure you try experiencing the moment.  Sometimes i catch myself in downward spirals about how im a failure and i have no friends and how the world is gonna end sooj because global warming but then i think, ""wait a second,  what about right now, nothing particularly bad is happening to me currently, im just walking mindinh my own business. Lifes great""

Honestly im about to sound like a hippe but bare with me. Lifes uncertain and alot of the time you have litterally no idea whats going. Just these big large challenges in our faces. It could be a job we want to get, our personality we neee to impove, really all kinds of a shit.

A certian philosopher use to say that these challenges are like giant boulders in our path, we cant just use all our energy to push them because well wed die of exhaustion before they moved 1 inch. Instead we should be like water flowing around the bolder, not quite ignoring the problem but also not letting it get in your way.

It doesn’t sound like these people are providing positive value to your life and it isn’t worth your time, your energy or your sense of well-being to try to make them come around.

soc_1186874,socialskills,reddit_comment,173,"Well, online dating is pretty tough in that aspect because we are talking to strangers that is pretty much outside of our social circle. So, naturally, initial interactions would usually be dry because its the get to know phase. 

Also, it takes both parties to make it work, as in if either one of you are not into it, then, its gonna be awkward. This somewhat depends on luck and strategy to spark interesting interactions. It is true that if you guys dont vibe, you guys just dont.

There's also the case that some people are just like that. That is, they are dry texters. You could try asking if they'd like for a voice call instead.

On the other hand, some people can also be quite shallow, in which they may seem uninteresting to talk to if youre looking for deep conversations. But, this also means that they're interesting in a different manner which you would only know when you get to know them. 

Just my two cents but hope that helps!"

One day he asks me to hang out and I was baffled because her I am thinking this guy is someone who does more stuff, has more experience, and is in a completely different class of people than me. Then I realized that ""class"" isn't about how much money you make or where you work. Its about being able to respond to others appropriately. Then I learned how much money he makes and I was blown away. Not only does he make triple what I do but he has the tendency to e very casual about it, like money is just something that gets him what he wants but it isn't essential. I realized then that he considered me his equal as far personality goes and that money has nothing to do with who you really are, unless you let it get that way.

soc_885784,socialskills,reddit_comment,951,"&gt;Dude, don't get me wrong... but US is just the LAST place I would like to live or visit. Sure there are awesome innovation in the Silicon Valley and great universities... and things are cheap... but what else?

It is really a matter of preference. I don't blame you for preferring Canada.

People in the US are poor mostly by option. There are so many work opportunities, if you are minimally able to work. Only the really old people or sick people can't find jobs. Otherwise, some people like to go out and use drugs and commit crimes, then complain why no one wants to give them a six figure desk job.

Mass shootings are a very small number of the deaths here. You are from Brazil, right? There way more shooting there than in the US. I went to São Paulo for work once and everyone is afraid of getting robbed at gunpoint while here in the US people don't really bother at all. And most shootings that happen here are between druggies, so normal people don't have to worry for most part. Very few are school shootings, like many people believe to be the majority. There are still more deaths caused by drunk drivers than by guns yet, no one calls for more alcohol regulations or bans (it doesn't work anyway, and same goes for guns).

There many universities in the US for free for those without good income and the in-state tuition fees are not really that expensive. I won't be a fancy private university, however. These people who get absurd debits are mostly those who went to a fancy university to take a degree in lesbian dance studies and get surprised that there aren't six figures jobs aligned right after graduation. I feel bad for these people because they are led to believe that community college is the last resort choice only for the really stupid, but the reality is that most companies don't care where they graduated from, but what you can do for them. I know people did community college for free and even a small stipend and their families were not even that poor.

I don't know much about the food or drug safety here. I know people who buy food here to bring to other countries because it is perceived that food, specially baby formulas, are much safer here.

The older folks I met in São Paulo told me that at most a thousand people were killed by the military during that period. The city was much safer back then, otherwise. Today this is the number of people who are murdered every month! To be fair, it wasn't perfect either. There was corruption, it is just that nobody knew about it. Today they lament that corruption known to be widespread and little is done to combat it. The little that was done cracking down the communist regime from Lula, there are many people who believe that it had only political motivation, not that they were the bulk of corruption, if even any at all.

And, yeah, me being an aviation enthusiast, I celebrate Embraer being let go by Boeing. However, they had a good reason behind. The E2 series jets are a technological marvel, but they can't sell it for a good profit, because of the saturated market for regional jets. They need to focus on something that will bring them money, instead, like military. The main reason why Boeing was interested on them was because of the C-390 Millennium, built using E2-Jets technology, but for a much more profitable market. Boeing appears to be still cooperating with that program.

The reason why illegal immigrants are allow to stay here as long as they don't do nasty stuff is because the border with Mexico was very porous for very long time and now it is too late to send all them back, both in the economic perspective and also humanitarian ones. If Trump indeed manages to shut down the border for illegal crossings (probably he won't, but the intention is valid), then this issue will eventually disappear. Then there are states that cash on the illegal immigrants, like California, that promise them many social benefits, but then they have to work themselves down to be able to pay for their taxes. I'm pretty sure that Canada doesn't treat the illegal immigrants as good as that.

And yes, immigrate to Canada is quite easy, I looked at it before. You just need a decent degree, to be at a reasonable young age, speak a decent English and French and get an ok job offer. I don't know about the money in the bank, maybe enough to cover the moving expenses, but you can loan that and make it show on your bank statement, then pay back. All this is easy to get for most people that are able to move to a different country. If you can't have a college degree and get a reasonable job in your home country, chances are that you won't have any of that in Canada either, so don't bother moving there.

Again, I respect your preference for Canada, just refrain from spread fake or misleading statements about other countries that you don't know. I was anti-American before I came here, and came here against my own taste, but I swore that I wouldn't have any opinion on the US unless that I visited it first. I came and I was surprised on how I was brainwashed by the communists that ruled my home country. Today I hate communism. You can have it for you, if you like and choose so, but US shall never be any of that."
soc_25606,socialskills,reddit_comment,296,"&gt; Being a slave to my reproductive organs...

LOL well at least you're not starting off with this fantastic line.  Great job ;)

That's really tough if you have very little contact with her and can't make small talk to establish a relationship before asking the question.  Circumstances state that you HAVE to ask her directly without any extra ""padding"" to soften the question, and hopefully she'll realize that when you ask her.

What I like about your proposal is 1) you say you're interested in getting to know her, 2) you have a self-imposed timeline for immediate action ""I'll call you tonight,"" and 3) you're proposing a coffee date.  It shows that you're a man with a plan.

*Personally* I'm not a fan of you having her enter her own number into your phone.  I know that it's a thing people do, but that practice just never sat well with me.  My personal opinion is that if a guy wants a gal's number, he can ask for it, and write it down himself.  It also just requires her to say her number verbally, instead of having to take the extra step to enter it into your phone.  By writing it down yourself, you're making it easier for her to tell you her number.  And wouldn't you want to make it as easy as possible?  

That being said, that's an extremely personal preference on my part, and I don't know how others would feel about it.  My suggestion is ""Hey, I've noticed you around [if she doesn't already know who you are] and I'm interested in learning more about you.  If you're single, can I have your number, so I can call tonight and set up a coffee date?""  Your way should work, too, so YMMV."
soc_479150,socialskills,reddit_comment,133,"Instead of saying ""I can't come, but I really want to"", why don't we just tell them the really excuse, and if they're understanding enough, they'll understand. Instead of making excuses and vague promises? 

For example: A friend invited you to a party, but you weren't in the mood that day. You could say: ""Hey, sorry thanks for inviting me, but I'm not in the mood for party today. How about another time? \[Proceeding to offer a specific time when you want to hang out with them\]"". In this way, they will get the clear about you and also see that you're genuine with your words, not just trying to make some lame excuses and vague promises to get away with an invitation.

soc_39120,socialskills,reddit_comment,305,"So, before I begin, I'm a college student working part-time at the Apple Store.
Personally, I really enjoy my job. However, one of my coworkers sees it as ""just a job"" and is never in too great of a mood. So, sometimes I find it hard to talk to him.

Anyways, during my shift today, I saw him looking unhappy and stand-offish, as always, and decide to say hi to him. In an effort to lighten his mood I ask, ""you're graduating from college, soon, right? Must be real exciting.""

He says, ""I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I still need to get a real job, though.""

I put on my best smile and say, ""But, you can work here full-time maybe, you know? Work your way up to Apple corporate.""

Here's what I was trying to do: listening to my coworker made me think he needed some reassurance things were going to be okay. I tried to accomplish this by reminding him he has a job now and could try for a higher position once he has a college degree. I understand his situation so I tried to help him look on the bright side, and replied in a way that could keep the conversation going.

He responds, ""Dude, we've talked about this before. You still don't get it."" So, naturally, I let him be. If he didn't want to have a conversation, then I wasn't going to force it.

A few weeks prior we had a similar conversation in which he also acted like a complete cunt.

So, lesson is: If you want people to warm up to you, empathize with them, and understand that they might not share the same worldview that you have. No one wants to join your self-pity party. Be appreciative towards anyone who is trying to help."
soc_544110,socialskills,reddit_comment,121,"(IMO) In today's society a phone number is not as personalized as social media (ex. Your employer has your phone number but you wouldn't want them to have access to your snapchat). We all receive numerous calls from telemarketers on a daily basis, meaning our phone numbers are not as private or personal as we would like to think. You might have a crush on her but she's not into you. She accepted your request to follow her on Instagram (did she follow you back?), she spoke to you first when you saw her in public, she engaged you in small talk on the walk to your cars, but she doesn't give out phone numbers? That's just silly. (Just my opinion)"
soc_8862,socialskills,reddit_comment,1355,"Hey Obitual,
Here is my strategy for making conversation, not sure if it will be helpful (it is structured like this because I do philosophy...) but I find it effective in my conversations.

It's possible to carry a conversation on almost any topic by following a general structure of questions, without needing to understand anything specific about a topic (though it helps). The keys are asking questions and communicating to the other person/people that you are interested-if you seem bored people will disconnect.


*  My first step is to think of general questions I can ask that are different enough from the cliches that people don't switch off. At a wedding reception tonight it was ""What are you looking forwards to about the rest of the year."" This gives the person an opportunity to talk about something that is significant to them, without restricting the scope of possible topics. eg. asking ""what do you do?"" requires the person to talk about their work, but they may hate it and try to avoid talking about it. Some people won't have an answer, but most will and now you have a topic that engages them.


*  Now without knowing what their answer will be you can pretty much plan your next question; all it has to do is invite them to elaborate on the topic. eg. ""Why are you looking forwards to that?"" I like this strategy because it takes some of the pressure off me to drive the conversation, I have now given the other person permission to be the main contributor.


*  As the conversation continues I need to become more specific with my questions, but I can still predict some of the structure to them. So here are some types of questions: - content: get them to explain the nuts and bolts of the topic. eg. if they have said Christmas ask them what Christmas looks like for them, do they have traditions. If the topic is holidays ask them if they have already made plans. etc... What we want is for them to educate us about something they are interested in.

*  Here are some themes you can use in thinking of questions:  
  *  *attachment*: what is their place in relation to the topic. We want to find out why they are interested, or involved, or merely why they want to talk about this. If they say football then we want to know what about football interests them. Do they play football? Are they just a spectator? Is it their kids that play football? If they say Reddit then we can ask whether they like to lurk or do they like to comment heaps? Are they a daily reader or sporadic.  
*  *emotions*: we want to find out their emotional connection to a topic. Is it something that makes them happy or excited, or is it infuriating to them. This gives us an insight into how a person thinks and what they value, things that are very helpful for forming long-term friendships. In general you don't ask direct questions like ""How does that make you feel?"" (which I think is a weird question), but rather ""What do you like about Christmas?"" or ""Can Christmas be a stressful time for you?""

*  *history*: not always that interesting but it gives us context to the topic. eg. ""Has your family always celebrated Christmas?"" or ""How did you find out about Reddit?""

The next step is the harder part, but isn't a requirement when making friends. You now want to start relating to what the person is talking about, this shows that you are engaged in the conversation and also provides them the opportunity to learn about you. There are lots of different ways to do this, especially to stay appropriate to the topic.

*  Broadly speaking you can connect by sharing similarities (what you have in common or can relate to), differences (what you are unfamiliar with or approach differently), or questions (what puzzles you about something, or something you want to know. Even better is to ask them their advice). These three are the methods of connecting, to which we have to add content:

*  attitude: connect with the way they feel about a topic. You can probably relate to someone's passion for a topic, even if it's nuclear physics, or sympathize with their frustration, even if it's over the colour of nail polish, because you have attitudes towards stuff to; so you are engaging with the attitude regardless of your interest in the content. eg. So you love Reddit because of the cool AMAs, I love reading those too. Which ones have been your favorites. Or ""I find people's stupidity frustrating, I don't know anything about nail polish but I often feel that big companies can lose touch with what their customers really want.""

*  result: relate to their success/failure in an area. eg. ""I've never had a high karma comment, what do you recon is the secret to a good comment?"" - your understanding: tell them whether you understand what they are talking about or not as a means to continue the conversation. If you do understand give them a summary and ask whether that is a fair representation of what they were saying. eg. So you like Christmas because it brings your whole family together. If you don't understand ask them to explain it a different way (eg. ELI5), give a summary, or highlight a specific point they made for more information about it.

*  how does it effect me: (not for all topics) get them to explain why you should care about the topic. eg. I'm not a Christian, so do you think I can get excited about Christmas as well?

Edit: formatting


**Edit** On account of the discussion generated I wanted to clarify a few points.

1) Yes, this method is not natural. Yes, it can make you sound like a robot. However, *people who are natural and good at conversation don't need this advice.* This advice is for the people who are frustrated by their failures, often directly through trying to be natural. So your comments are true, but miss the purpose and the audience for the advice (I'm not trying to sell a cancer cure to the healthy).

2)  Yes, natural is better, so lets try to be more natural in conversation. Like in the movie Yes Man, if you are to extreme with this advice it will cause problems. But, hopefully through using the advice it will make you more comfortable with having conversations. Then you will converse more, get better at it and progress towards being more natural. IMHO I think that this kind of structure can help that progression.

3)  I am a nerd, in some ways. I can be awkward, at times. I don't have as many conversations as I would like. I often find it hard to practice what I preach. But I have improved in conversation in many ways as a result of thinking through structures like this.

4)  Use what you want, tweak it, ignore it. Your choice. Will it work for you? Maybe... I hope so. Everything is about context, who you are talking to, where, when... The structure I have formulated tries to capture some of that in a coherent way, give advice general enough to be useful. Conversation is fluid in most regards, some understand that and are comfortable with it, to others it's a dark and intimidating space to enter-I'm just trying to shed some light.


I am truly thankful for all the responses, it's exciting. Also, there have been lots of other great advice posted by others that is worth checking out, very thought provoking and helpful. Here are some of the great comments (I'll  have missed some-sorry).

One that you might have considered yourself and could have done straight away. That is clear-up  the confusion with honesty. In the situation where she found out that everyone knows that you asked her out and that you felt like you gave her an ultimatum, she confronted you with it. In that situation you said you ""made-up"" but did you tell her the reason why you sent a follow-up text a week after she did not reply to your request (which is more than reasonable to do after a week!). Did you also tell her that you felt ""trapped"", ""nervous"" or maybe even ""anxious"" about not getting a reply and that is why you talked to someone about it and that is how everyone probably knows that you asked her out. This might not have improved your relationship at that point but I can say with almost 100% certainty that your relationship would have healed way better afterwards and that you would not have felt the ""regret"" and/or other emtions about the situation as you are feeling now.  


But this is just my perspective, I would probably have done the same as you did now if I were a few years younger. But as I am now, I know that telling the truth, even if it hurts both parties, is always better as hiding your feeling and/or telling lies."
soc_931584,socialskills,reddit_comment,185,"This is probably gonna sounds horrible because you’re asking for advice to get over it but... the best way to get over something is honestly to accept it, which sounds like the opposite of getting over it but just hear me out!

The more you try to fight against being sad, the more you push yourself to swim upstream, the more ELEPHANT you’re gonna feel. When I tell myself, “it’s normal to be sad and grieve over relationships that were rewarding and fun and are now over” I honestly feel liberated. That is the turning point where I know I’m sad and because I’m not fighting against it, it’s not on the forefront of my mind anymore and I carry on with my day without constantly thinking about it or forcing myself to just get over something that my body and brain aren’t ready to get over. Acceptance allows me to heal. Acceptance gives me bliss. It’s kind of just another way of shrugging of your feelings like, “eh, of course I’m gonna be sad and I’m cool with that.” I hope that makes sense."

The puzzle? Don't try to solve it.
The codes? Don't try to decipher them.
The answers? Don't sit with them too long.
The possible regret? Don't let it become a possibility.
The future...don't try to read it.

Conventional advice would be to ask if she's available to 'hang out' (whatever this entails I'm not too sure). Personally, I tell ladies that I am old school and I like to go on walks and listen to the birds.

There is no non-weird way of asking. There are no cheat codes.

Snapchat is essentially texting anyway...

Also, who's to say she isn't thinking of asking you the same?

Possible approaches:

""Give me your number or I'll hurt you.""

""Give me your number or I'll hurt me.""

""Give me your number or I'll hurt you and that'll hurt me.""

soc_1113539,socialskills,reddit_comment,222,"I can relate to OP and elaborate his/her question more. I think some people got it wrong here. It's not mostly about we don't know what to talk at the surface level but we don't enjoy doing it. We may be good at small talk but we'll not have an emotional connection if we only talk at the surface level.

For example, I sometimes go on for hours talking fluff but in the end when I reflect on that conversation, there's nothing really deep that I could connect to and I feel the conversation was just empty. So, to answer OP's question, you can't do anything in deciding how and at what emotional level you can connect to others in your first interaction. Everyone is different and some people open up quickly and some people take a long time to connect and some people never open up. So, all you can do is, mix your conversation with surface level and deep topics equally over a number of interactions and some stage you'll realise where your connection is heading towards and you can decide whether you want to continue that relationship or not. In the past, I was too hasty to write off people when I didn't connect with them right away. But time has taught me to be patient the hard way"
soc_1650286,socialskills,reddit_comment,281,"There are two reactions you're going to get to someone with that kind of personality:

* Someone sees prey who is easy to take advantage of. If you have a wholesome personality like Mickey Mouse people will think ""this person assumes everyone is well-intentioned, and I can use that to encourage them to do things for me."" This can lead to being used as a ""henchman"" by predators and bullies, and it can lead also to being swindled or manipulated into compromising positions.
* It's assumed the ""nice"" thing is an act because you want something, whether it's money, sex, a relationship, social status or for other people to vouch for you when you engage in wrongdoing. A lot of people are very jaded and cynical because they've been around folks who act all buddy-like with the hopes that it will be ""rewarded"" with some specific type of payoff. This can make people feel a little bothered or uncomfortable if you present in that kind of way.

It's absolutely essential to be kind, but this is where a bit of acting is necessary. Being kind in a sort of Silas Marner way that shows that you're on your guard and have an edge is going to temper some of these assumptions a little bit. I'm not going to say this means you should act like a dickhead while offering to fix someone's bike tires or spot them a dollar, just that you need to demonstrate awareness. A lot of people who think of themselves as ""nice"" or ""kind"" lack the theory of mind to know how other people might perceive this and react accordingly, so that is something to work on."
soc_233223,socialskills,reddit_comment,242,"I think it depends on how things ended between you and your ex. And it depends on the person. I mean, even things ended bad, then offering help can be good. 

So at best, you should consider (or ask the mutual friend how would your ex react) if you contact him. You don't need to do much, offering help, a ear to listen to and yourself to be there if he needs someone is good enough and can be great. Don't force him, tell him that you care for him (because you actually do) and that you're asking because of that. You had a relationship and there were things which might be strong enough to overcome a break up. 

A bad case would be, if he just rejects you. A worst case could be him putting in a more worse situation (but I don't think that might happen and/or you should carefully listen to him, so you can avoid this). 

On the other hand: You could help someone to overcome a bad time. Also: What could you lose if you offer your help?

Personally I would try to reach him and offer help. I think I like more the idea to getting rejected and tried to help, instead of not trying meanwhile a person would have thankfully taken help. Even more: If I cared for a person I couldn't just sit there and not try to help this person. 

Wish you well! "

In this country they have 4 years mandatory prison for young adults.  However,  there are things you can do to reduce the horror.  The main thing is to be so involved with exciting shit that you are never bored.  And for me,  that is best done outside of school.  Join a voluntary organisation.  Hell,  being an election year,  get involved with the campaign of the candidate of your choice.  It would be a great way to meet people who are passionate about making the world a better place (they all feel this way,  even the supporters of the really wacko candidates) and make connections that lead to paid work.

Talk to people at work, while your out and about. Go and do activities and events around you that seem interesting. Take a chance.

I know this is going to sound like bullshit advice but the more encounters you have with people the better you will get. The only three things you need to do are always be appreciative of yourself and never judge yourself as well as remrbber that nobody has any right to judge you.

Think of yourself from an outside perspective. Someone comes up to you and tries to make small-talk, what do you think about that? Do you think, “wow this person is so pathetic and is so awkward yikes get me out of here?” No, I don’t think you do. I for one applaud anybody trying to get out of their comfort zone as long as their friendly. If you would think those thoughts like mentioned above and be hateful, you need to do some introspection.

Just have kind intentions and the rest will come. I used to be an introvert and slip up on everything I said.  Many people gave me awkward looks and treated me with disdain and confusion. All of those experiences made me better at socializing as well as to easier weed out the negative people who aren’t appreciative of me. Same to you.

Good luck!"
soc_211485,socialskills,reddit_comment,255,"I work with people that don't drink, and I went to university with people that didn't. It's tough with a vast majority of people that do drink, to be a non-drinker. However, you'll be respected if you don't. 

My advice would be to stick to your guns. A lot of times, an unpopular opinion is the better one, for your health or otherwise. You have very valid reasons why not to drink, and I applaud your decision. 

When you go on a date with a girl, what's the purpose of the date? Aren't you looking for a relationship? If so, then why waste your time with someone that immediately shuns your health decisions, or judges you for a trivial dietary choice. My girlfriend is vegetarian, I love bacon, but her diet isn't gonna keep me from dating her. 
Same goes for people you want to befriend. Don't you want to have friends that support your decision? 

Another thing, alcohol is an enslaving substance. Even people who drink recreationally regret their decisions at times, but you can't ""Ctrl-Z"" until after that time has been wasted (pun intended). You're at an advantage in your sobriety. Trust me. 
Also, you're a reliable DD, so you're actually a desirable asset to any group of friends going out (assuming there's driving involved). 

As you get older, people will care less and less whether or not you drink, so you have that to look forward to. You'll be fine!!! People have plenty of fun in sobriety. 
Best of luck my friend. "
soc_343793,socialskills,reddit_comment,279,"I can't really give you the answers because they will be unique to you. I know that in my own self-improvement, it was about overcoming a lot of fears holding me back. I'd see an event, but I'd tell myself some reason why the event wasn't for me or was too intimidating.  I gradually started pushing myself to go to events that scared me, and pushing past my excuses.  

It's up to you to pick events to go to.  I went to board game Meetups, religious/cultural events, joined folk dance communities, a random neighborhood poker group, and made more of an effort to invite people to hang out, even if it was just Netflix. 

Each new thing was a struggle for me, and each ended being way less intimidating when i actually showed up. I also made it a policy to go to anything I was invited to. I have zero interest in poker, but a friend invited me to their group, so I went and loved it and the group turned into some of my closest friends. The folkdancing group I got into because a coworker invited me to their group.  Showing up to that was terrifying, I really had to force myself to go, but once I went I immediately fell in love with it and made an instant group of friends. 

I bet if you went to Meetup.com, you would find events that appeal to you. There are beer-tasting groups, and groups that go to films and concerts together. You could also find a group that does something random that you've never done before, like sailing or something, and just show up and try it out.  "
soc_1705734,socialskills,reddit_comment,335,"I’m not going to ask you questions specifically because I feel weird/don’t want to be a creep, so I’ll just tell you about me. And maybe what I say isn’t relatable, and that’s okay. If you want to respond with your experience, that is up to you! Whenever I got my period, I became extremely depressed. Like really absolutely sad to the point where I just barely made it through the day. Everything made me cry, but I also didn’t want to continue (I also would fill an extra large pad and it would overflow while sleeping 🙄.) I am unofficially diagnosed with PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder) - I described my symptoms and the gynecologist was like, “Um, absolutely you do”. 

“Both PMDD and PMS may cause bloating, breast tenderness, fatigue, and changes in sleep and eating habits. In PMDD, however, at least one of these emotional and behavioral symptoms stands out:

Sadness or hopelessness
Anxiety or tension
Extreme moodiness
Marked irritability or anger
The cause of PMDD isn't clear. Underlying depression and anxiety are common in both PMS and PMDD, so it's possible that the hormonal changes that trigger a menstrual period worsen the symptoms of mood disorders.” From [here.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premenstrual-syndrome/expert-answers/pmdd/faq-20058315)

I use birth control to regulate my hormones. I use the Neuvaring and skip my periods because I just *can’t*. Except I decided 11 days ago to try not using birth control because I’m 29 and going to be 30 in January. 

If you are wondering if your hormones are affecting you similarly, 100% start a journal to track your feelings and when you get your period. In a chart like: date, feelings, and number of days since your last period. 

So to answer your question, to me, yeah that’s normal. But you shouldn’t have to tolerate it. **Im not a doctor, so talk with your doctors** (Gyno, PCP/primary care physician, and psychologist or psychiatrist if you have one) because again, you don’t deserve to feel so sad. And you deserve to be heard."
soc_173837,socialskills,reddit_comment,149,"I think it really depends on the person you are talking to, because I also find the same thing as you at times. Whenever I'm talking to someone who is naturally bubbly, confident and talkative it is very easy to talk one on one because there is always a point to feed off to keep the discussion moving. When you're talking to someone like this, pick up on certain details and expand on that.
Now, whenever I talk to someone who is a bit less talkative I find it hard to really take control of the conversation and lead the way, which can lead to awkward silences like you mention. Does it have to do with simply not having enough to talk about in detail? Probably, I guess that's something we need to work on when the other person in a one on one convo can't carry things themselves"
soc_54940,socialskills,reddit_comment,164,"I think the most important thing to realise is that changing things in your life is dependent on YOUR OWN INITIATIVE.

Next time you want to progress a relationship from acquaintance to friend, remember that its up to YOU. You have to shift the topic from work to movies, music and hobbies. You have to push the conversation till you find shared interests. Once you've identified these interests, the progression from acquaintance to friend will happen by itself.

However, this is the theoretical aspect of making connections. In terms of practical application you're gonna have to:

1. Learn how to maintain a conversation
2. Be outgoing, confident and engaging

Your ultimate goal is to practice this with your current acquaintances, so that when you move you'll be ready to make new connections (don't use the excuse that you can't practice because you have to study).

In the end, everything you want to change in your life is dependent on YOUR determination and YOUR initiative.

"
soc_1138844,socialskills,reddit_comment,774,"One of the biggest parts is learning to face things instead of putting them off.  Problems with people, bills, broken things, anything that sucks.  You have to take care of it, and sooner is waaay fuckin better than later.   

Another big part is developing your backbone and empathy at the same time.  There's a line between polite and firm that you should learn how to walk. A man isn't a man if he is able to be pushed around easily, nor is he a man if he doesn't care about anyone but himself.

Also, your gonna need to actually get to know yourself.  I highly recommend meditation, it has helped me immensely in paying attention to my thoughts and actions, but there are many ways to go about it.  What are your dreams, hopes, skills, weaknesses?  Which brings me to my next part,

You're gonna have to realize that you are a work in progress, always.  How far that progress goes is entirely up to you.  Do you want to learn how to cook?  Look up some recipes and put in some practice.  Pay attention to what flavors you like, and what smells good together.  Want to learn another language?  Do it, but you have to actually put the work in.  Are you small and scrawny and don't like it about yourself?  Start working out and eating right.  Almost anything about yourself that you don't like, you can change.  And literally anything that you don't like about yourself, you can overcome.  

Be more stubborn than any streak of bad luck.  Take breaks as needed, but if it's something even somewhat important, don't ever fuckin give up.  Perseverance, honed and used properly will be one of the most important tools you will develop.

Your self approval is more important than approval from everyone you'll ever meet combined.  Listen to that voice in the back of your head that says, ""this mother fucker shouldn't be talking to me like this."" ""I should stop and see if that lady is ok."" ""That clerk gave me an extra 20, I need to point it out and give it back."" Or whatever that voice might be telling you, you get what I mean (I hope.)

Learn to be self reliant.  In the end, the only person that can possibly cover you 100% of the time is you.  Learn to fix some shit, hone your skills and use them to get better paying jobs, learn how to build something, basically don't accept that you have to pay someone to do anything for you.  If someone else can make it work, so can you.  The only thing they have on you is practice and desire.

In the opposite direction of the last one, always help the people you care about when you can.  Your circle, your tribe, pack, etc, is one of the most important things in life, and honestly what makes it worth living.  Leave no one behind, and more often than not they will try to return the favor.  That being said, don't you even fuckin think about keeping score.  There are no favors owed, that shit is a gift.  If you want to help someone just so they have to help you, then help them by getting out of their life and getting your head straight, that shits toxic af.

Also, it's probably pretty apparent that I'm not a lady, but I'm my experience, they like men with a lot of the traits outlined above, plus they absolutely love to laugh, to have fun (who doesn't,) and when you treat them like people instead of alien creatures that you talk to differently.  They also like when you're genuine, caring, gentle, strong and a good listener.

soc_768108,socialskills,reddit_comment,459,"I mean, you shouldn't. If you're happy and leading a life you feel is fulfilled then by all means don't work on your social skills. I see from another post that you have a girlfriend, so clearly you do have *some* social skills. 

I think your read on people with social skills is not as objective and fact based as you'd like. Sure some highly social people are all of those negative things, but it sounds like you've got an emotional response to these people - they're morally in the wrong because they 'use' people, they're 'dishonest', it's automatically 'disingenuous' etc. And that's fine, you can have an emotional response to those people, clearly you've had bad experiences within social groups and that's bound to make you dislike the idea. But that doesn't make it **true** that having good social skills does make someone disingenuous, you feel it does, but that isn't the same as it de facto being the case.

Similarly since you are inclined to be less social as part of your authentic self, it makes sense that you would view social people as being inauthentic. But the important thing is to remember that just because being social is inauthentic *for you* doesn't make it so for other people. I am automatically quite social, it's just who I am as a person, not talking to people and not wanting to chat with people and get to know them would be intensely inauthentic *for me*. The whole point of authenticity is to be true to yourself, and since everyone is different it makes sense that different people would have different levels of authentic social wants. 

Finally, I have no desire to posses the ability to 'survive without the help of others'. I like other people. I don't think there's anything wrong with relying on others or having others rely on you. You have made complete independence some sort of virtue that you imply as being just 'true'. When actually it is something you clearly value, but that is not the same as it being some sort of objective goal all people should work towards.

Tl:dr - You're entitled to your opinion about not wanting to be social, you do you. But you don't actually have an 'objective' standpoint of facts and logic as your writing suggests there are lots of emotional reasons why you view being social as bad and you assume somethings about your experiences to be objective facts when they're not.   
You don't need to change anything about how you feel or act regarding social skills, but you probably should realise that you aren't in some way superior for not being into it, in the same way that people who are social aren't superior to you."

soc_1100962,socialskills,reddit_comment,271,"As an older person, I've struggled with group conversations my whole life. I am fine (and even can be a chatterbox) when there's just two or three of us, but each additional person makes it harder and harder. At about 6 people, it seems impossible. Even when someone asks me a question to bring me into the conversation, I struggle to say more than a few sentences, and I often feel like I kill the conversation.

It's a strange thing, because I have taught classes of 30+ people before with no problems, even ad-libbing a lot (not following a lesson plan).

Although I still have trouble in group conversations, I've realized it's okay and nothing to be ashamed about. I've learned to just sit back and enjoy what others have to say and not think that I should be ""holding my own"". There will be plenty of times when I am in a smaller group and can express myself. I might think I wish I could have said such-and-such to the larger group, but I've learned that's just not who I am and not stress out about it. That's not my time to shine. :)

I've also realized that no one gets offended about me being quiet in larger groups. They just think I am quiet, and it's true. Nothing to feel ashamed about.

Of course everyone is different, and you should explore how to improve your skills if that's what you want to do. Just know that for some of us (myself included), being comfortable and accepting our quietness is also an option worthy of consideration.

When I asked my best friend of 20 years for help and he wasn't there....it hurt. I spent months in bed alone, with nothing but my thoughts. Then one day I made a choice. To start. Start small. Today I'm going to make my bed, done, that enough for today. Today I'm going to make my bed and clean my room. Today I'm going to make my bed and clean my room and go for a walk...etc. I spent every moment reflecting and wondering how I can do better, how I can love myself and be the best person I can. Then I realized there is no way out. There is no magic door that when you walk through it you will never feel this again. Every experience that happened to me and every decision I've made didn't disappear, they were added to who I was and I grew from them. Each day I grow a little more. Remember that you are not alone.

soc_822621,socialskills,reddit_comment,385,"&gt;  I even more rarely want it from someone who isn't close enough to me to be able to give it to me straight. 

Because ego gets in the way. Which is why you do it indirectly. No one's forcing you to do anything. And no one's expecting anyone to change. I understand that your experiences might be leading you to have an adverse reaction to it, but there's no shaming, guilt, or coercion here. You're being shown a path, and you decide if you want to take it.

I think you misinterpreted what I've said. If someone is doing something that DIRECTLY impacts you, then you set a healthy boundary. If they don't respect it, you leave. I'm referring to advice that you think is beneficial for them. You present the idea in a packagable way. If they want it, cool. If they don't, then cool.

I'll do what you've suggested and show you how it can be offensive and put someone on the defensive. I'll be super honest in the way that you've suggested. The vibe I get from you is that you were codependent, learned about boundaries, and now anything that involves any sort of tactfulness, you get reactive to because it brings up past traumas. You need extreme honesty as an extreme opposite reaction to past trauma that you had to get over. The vibe I'm getting is that you're still in the calibrating process and that you still need to figure things out. 

You see how that comes off as offensive? Or maybe it didn't, but it could be. I wouldn't know, which is why tact is better. Instead, I'd ask you questions like ""Do you feel that how you deal with it is the best choice?"", then I'd ask ""why?"". If you give an answer that shows that you put thought into it and it makes sense, then I'll leave it at that and move on the convo. If there's signs of indecisiveness and rationalization, I might show an alternative indirectly, and then leave it at that and make it so that it's up to you to consider it. Yet, when done and not spoken of out in the open, it's in my opinion, the most considerate way of doing it. There's a difference in how to approach things."

Sometimes that's better at first because there's less room to be nervous, but it depends on the person. Other times it's better to go on a date where you interact more so things are less awkward between the two of you. (don't overthink it! ;) )

soc_1556055,socialskills,reddit_comment,178,"I appreciate this advice, especially your second paragraph. I think the toughest moments are the pink flags, early in a relationship, possibly before it's defined. When someone struggles with jealousy, it can go hand-in-hand with anxiety, which makes it hard to trust your gut. Sometimes, even with anxiety, your gut is right and the pink flag is actually mostly red.

I've fallen into the trap of trying to justify my feelings and behaviors before, especially when it doesn't work out and the other person's perspective is that my jealousy or anxiety contributed. While everyone has something they could probably improve on, we're entitled to our feelings and to make mistakes is only human.

I wish I had someone to tell this to me right now. Might as well start by telling myself. I hope things worked out for you, OP!

Id say even if you love her, it’s your life, and if she’s preventing you from fully living it I’ll warn you, that’ll lead to a miserable and unfulfilled life. Plenty of other girls who aren’t clingy can give you comfort and happiness, don’t feel like she’s the only person who can, hope this helps

Your limitations have work-arounds. Things are harder, but not impossible. You need to start from the viewpoint of ""what do I want to do"" and then figure out what needs to be done to get there. I get the impression that you have some self-imposed limitations going on. This is not uncommon for people with disabilities--you've built up this mindset that you just can't do it because people have treated you like that your whole life. But you're more capable than you think.

It's up to you to come up with solutions to areas where you struggle. It's just about how much energy you're willing to invest."
soc_791875,socialskills,reddit_comment,378,"I empathize a lot with what you said about enjoying being alone. Left to my own devices, I will spend most of my time in my room/doing my own thing. Now that I am in my last semester of college, though, I am making a decided effort to push myself outside of my comfort zone and spend more time with people, even if I don’t know them all that well. 

You are absolutely right to focus on confidence. It makes me happy to know that you are aware that that is the underlying issue and are not pushing the blame onto something else. That, to me, shows a level of self-awareness that I think a lot of people lack. Props to you!

To improve my confidence, I keep up a number of habits that bring me joy, such as exercise and playing music. I don’t know your hobbies, but keep them up and find ways to push yourself in them. Giving yourself small accomplishments on a regular basis (e.g. I’m going to run a little farther today, or I’m gonna play this whole passage memorized, etc.) really helps give you a confidence boost when you need it. It’s hard work, but once you get through it, it’s very rewarding.

Similarly, if your current relationships aren’t satisfying enough for you, find new ones. Reach out to people, introduce yourself to someone new every day, find groups of people with common interests that you share, join a club you’ve never been a part of before, shake things up! Last semester, I joined a dance group at my school. I had no dance experience going into it and I just put myself out there and it was so worth it.

I would also encourage you to open up to people more and give them the opportunity to know you better. You have already started that by posting here and letting this community know what you’re dealing with. I have often found people are very willing to support you and spend time with you if you put yourself out there and open up to them. However you choose to do that is up to you.

I’m rooting for you!! I’m on a similar journey myself. Let us know how things go. :)"

Go out when you want to, stay in if you feel like it. Don't over complicate it. You are also totally allowed to just ""not feel like it"" you don't need a convoluted reason for why.

soc_1828092,socialskills,reddit_comment,297,"congrats and props to you! for being honest with not only yourself, but also your not-so-close friends. I think the therapist gave great advice this time, and sadly more people don't see it that way (hence why your friends got angry). Personally I require a lot out of a friendship, and if they don't provide those, I don't really call them my friends and I unfortunately have to contend with the fact that I just don't have any. Kind of a similar boat.   


One thing that has helped me a lot when balancing expectations between friends, and who does what, and who has done more etc, is to just stop comparing those things. You should not expect anybody to do those things for you because as Americans, we believe in individuality and freedom (consequently, makes it worse for close friendships). Instead, just let them do w/e because the biggest thing I realized is that: **everyone has a different definition of friendship than you do**. So in that case, they won't reciprocate exactly when you did for them, and/or they'll do more or less or more importantly, different things to show their friendship. It's up to you whether you agree or not. If you don't agree, then they're just acquaintances, and if they happen to do everything you would've expected, well that person is a close friend, and it's important to take up the responsibility to treat them the same back and foster that relationship. 

But good on you for sticking up for your own values. I also rate my friends, and organize them by how good/close of a friend they are to me. People are always turned off when I say this, but if they were good friends, then honestly they wouldn't have to worry about it."

soc_1379541,socialskills,reddit_comment,148,"It really depends on how you ask the questions. If someone asks a teacher a stupid question during class, then I'd imagine everyone would be fine with it. People get annoyed if they feel that they are being used or disrespected. So if we ask them questions to try to get some quick information then yes, some people would get annoyed. On the other hand, if we ask them questions because we are trying to start a conversation and be friendly, then I think most people would tolerate it even if the question is stupid.  

Regarding how to stop asking stupid questions, if you are like me, then sometimes our brain just isn't working at its optimal level. It helps to wake up early and exercise. Being extra prepared also helps a lot, i.e: doing a lot of research beforehand or asking people who already have the experience."

But right now, for so many of us, it's like a huge weight taken off our back. 

While I think it's great to allow ourselves to feel this relief (which may be a new sensation) I think it's important... just my opinion... that we enjoy it now with the realization that at the right moment we will strive to be able to feel the same or some of the level of comfort we feel alone, with other people.

It all depends, I think friends going through abuse or troubles should def be given leeway and support to better their situation. But if someone’s natural character shows they have little care for your well-being by not respecting you, you’re absolved if responsibility.

soc_14411,socialskills,reddit_comment,171,"Get thee out of the house and off the Internet! You just need to find any excuse to talk to anyone - my ideal would be some kind of group activity where you can join or encourage socialising at a pub (or drinkery of your choice)

For example:
- A sports team... pub anyone?
- A choir ... pub anyone? 
- Language classes... pub anyone?
- Meetup groups are often already IN the pub so your hard work is already done!
- If you're at university still then just pick any club that looks interesting and rock up.

Also if I may suggest modifying your expectations... don't go out to anything with the expectation that you'll make a load of new lifelong friends. That's not how it works.

soc_1558780,socialskills,reddit_comment,642,"Hmm. I'm sorry they're saying this in their 20s no less. When I was in junior high and high school I wad bullied in a number of extreme ways, left me with PTSD. I was always shy growing up, but that turned into social phobia from my experiences. And I'm 36 now, still trying to fight to get out of those abuses and trauma.
So I totally understand where you're coming from and how much that must hurt or bother you. And how it upsets the apple cart.

I have much the same fear of judgement and rejection.

My mom and many teachers told me when you go to college everyone is less focused on what you're doing and more mature or actively all going toward the same or similar goal or career etc.

But the 2 years I was able to get through there were still assholes like that who want to step on you for their own ""entertainment"".

I can tell your that your books are not entirely wrong. Your self confidence might be low-ish, which is part of how you might see yourself. Don't dismiss the books, because of these few assholes or the person that's particularly they head of the problem. There's always going to be these negative toxic people that are not ""in your head"" that want to be cruel unfortunately... :/

They might want to see you screw up, but you seem pretty clever, I mean you're reading these self help books, putting them into practice best you can. You're going to school, doing a class presentation. I couldn't even do that, I was having massive panic attacks and would just quit the class.

So they might read you as shy or introverted, some micro expressions we all kind of pick up on our radar. And Maybe they see you are clever from other things you've done in class. That little clique might want to see you fail, but just from the tiny bits of personality you put out here in your post tells me you won't. 

But I know hearing that would shake your confidence, and make you feel off giving this presentation and possibility those jerkoff is gonna question you to be an asshole in hopes of making you look bad. 

It depends on how you want to address it.

You could tell the professor or teacher privately, what you overheard. If they're a sympathetic type teacher. I had one that told me, *""this is college now get over it""* - yeah real understanding, right? 🙄.

If you feel confident and brash enough, if this person does ask questions at the end to make you look bad, you can say in front of the class *""oh yeah, [person name] was this part of your plan like you said to make me look bad and see me fail?, okay go ahead what's your question""* that would reverse it and throw them off their game of hurting you. It would be funny to see them be speechless. 🤞

But I know that's a hard one to do. I know I couldn't have done it in my 20s with my terrible self confidence.

And the neutral option, I think would be, to do your presentation, and if they put in their 2 cents, answer them the best you can, which I think will be fine. It's not going to make you fail, that's just how that asshole thinks or hopes, but you won't.

Afterwards you can build up courage to tell them off at some point as well if wanted.

But whatever the outcome, you're already Better than them because you wouldn't do that to another person. So be confident in that asst least.

I wish you luck whatever you do in this situation, but don't lose what confidence you've built up based on a toxic element."

soc_1211941,socialskills,reddit_comment,245,"If you ever catch her eye, smile! But that’s probably an obvious.

Try sit in places close to her and socialise with the people around her. If she seems like an outgoing person if she’s in a big group so she may be join the conversation if something that interests her pops up. 

Try avoid crossing you arms and looking down, I know personally that makes me nervous or scared. 

If you’re having banter with one of your friends and she happens to walk past, maybe laugh a little more loudly (not obnoxiously tho) and move around a bit (e.g step back, put your head back, touch your friends shoulder). She’ll more likely notice you and see that you are a fun and open person to be around!

Honestly, instead of waiting just go up to her. Ask her small things if your nervous like ‘sorry what’s your next class?’ or ‘hey do we have homework’. Trival things like that will make her comfortable going up to you and asking that aswell, which will eventually lead to conversations. If you’re not ready to go and do that with her, do it with others you don’t really talk to. If you see someone quiet in the class, go try start up small talk. If it fails, oh well it’s not them your pinning after, if it succeeds you get confidence and possibly start a new friendship.

You think about something that makes you happy, or a person you like, and smile at yourself until you like what you see. Then you feel your face from inside, so you know what a good smile feels like. After a bit of practice, you are able to smile „on command“, i.e. whenever you see someone coming up to you, or looking at you, you can give them your best smile. So they know that when they get to see your RBF at some point, that’s not about them, because you always smile to their face.

soc_1184266,socialskills,reddit_comment,239,"I’d avoid statements for a start. You could try asking more questions rather than making statements. When the conversation progresses, you can descretly guide the conversation to the topic of your choice. For example, if you wanted to talk about how you climbed a mountain, it could go something like:

“You look like the type of guy that would climb a mountain, how often do you hike?”

The beauty of that kind of question is it is an assumption that would get the other person curious on what about him made you think he likes climbing mountains. In that case, it doesnt matter if your assumption is right or wrong, as long it creates a conversation.

It’s also important to ask questions that puts the attention on the other person (relative to who youre speaking to, other people hate being talked about), that way they’ll be more eager to talk.

Its also important to create “openings” that the person youre speaking with could easily chime in and input something, and avoid long continuous speeches. E.g

“ Snyder’s cut Justice League really should have been the main release, I dont know about you, but are you huge on super heroes at all?”

Overall, it helps not to just jump on the topic of conversation but gradually progress from small talk, medium talk and finally the meaningful conversations youre hoping to have.

It is just my perspective and a valuable framework for improving confidence!*

Basically more or less, you realize that you're using drinking as a crutch to feel confident. So do most of us, including problem drinkers like myself. That's why I drank more or less. So the first piece of advice is to stop doing that.

Once we stop drinking, we realize we have no confidence. This hurts and frustrates us. Now if you were in recovery (never drinking again for the rest of your life), you would be force to overcome these problems, and that requires work. 

Basically these are the things we do when we enter and really work a ""recovery program"" - notice how these things target the underlying social problems most of us heavy users have.

* Become part of a community of people that you can share yourself with, face to face.
* Regularly attend group events with your community (doesnt matter what they do, could be a movie watchers meetup)
* Regularly talk to a variety of people outside of your group events (phone calls or texting!) to ask them about their lives and share your life with.
* Open yourself up to them, just like you're doing on reddit.
* Learn to be honest in all situations
* Look back on your life and see where your issues have caused damage to others (like emotional damage)
* Do your best to repair those relationships
* Live the rest of your life with an ethical underpinning
* Start helping people with their lives.

When you do this kind of stuff, it really just starts to make you feel fundamentally more comfortable in the world of humans.

* Because you open yourself up, you start feeling like there's nothing to hide.
* Because you help people, you feel like you have a fundamental value
* Because you repaired your past, you don't feel that nagging dread feeling.
* Because you live ethically, you feel good about your life.

At this point, over time, you begin to feel more comfortable and even confident in social situations."

Specifically, I will never pinch her because I want her to understand that only pleasure will derive from my physical interactions with her. If we're close or in a relationship though I'll pinch the shit out of somebody idc but at the point where I'm just lightly flirting or getting to know a girl, I never pinch or play punch or even hint at it.

She touches your back, elbows you, etc. That's fair game to me. But I wouldn't elbow her or touch her back in response. I would pull my Shoulder Touch move.

What you gotta do is find a moment to lay down a shoulder touch. One of those ""Hey, things are gonna be OK"" shoulder touches. Where your (singular) hand rests on her (singular) shoulder a moment as you console her.

The secret is that this will happen in a comical manner. It will be just you and her and you're chatting and she will say something like ""Yeah, so I stopped by Walgreen's but they were out of the mint chocolate chip ice cream"". After she says this, you will stop everything you're doing, give her a super concerned look, put your one hand on her shoulder, and tell her ""Hey... it's gonna be OK"" and then squeeze her shoulder a little. Not too rough. Just enough that says ""I got some manly ass hands"".

If it all goes down well, what will go through her head is the following:

FIRST, and most importantly, she will find this moment absolutely hilarious. It is up to you to deliver this move in an effective manner that results in laughter.

UNDERNEATH that moment of hilarity, she will also notice how sincere and supportive you were before she realized you were jk. She will have gotten a tiny glimpse into what an interaction with you WOULD be like if she ever needed that kind of emotional support.

And for the aftertaste? She gets a little bit of know-so on how fucking manly your hands are.

A little bit of laughter, a little bit of a connection, and a little bit of sexy. That's how you make a cocktail."
soc_1702550,socialskills,reddit_comment,198,"Happy birthday!!!

If I were you, I would **shift the frame of reference**. 

Meaning that: instead of caring too much if people care about my birthday, I would care less about what other people think of me and more about what I think about myself.

Things like: Another year has passed for me: 

* How I improved myself? 
* Is my health better or worse than last year? 
* Are my finances better or worse? 
* Are my relationships better or worse?

You see, our minds can focus on very few things at any given moment so if you focus on what matters, you don't have to spend mental energy on things that don't matter (again this is just my opinion but honestly, it couldn't matter less to me if people even know I have a birthday).

The paradox of that is that if you do just that, you will increase your worth in society as a healthier, richer, happier person. **And more people will start being attracted to you**. People that matter, people that want the best for you and will contribute to your well-being for many more happy birthdays :)

Right. When you stroke your own ego do you use lube or just like the feeling of a raw hand?

**You are policing language based on a minorty and a stereotype for that matter acting like you, some random person on fucking reddit know how people should speak and behave IRL based on YOUR fucking preferences. To the point anyone who disagrees is just ""sad men having fun being lonely and never finding anyone"" being the EXACT insulting reductionist you claim them to be. Because people like you are shortsighted hypocrites**

""WhY aRe PeOpLe uPsEt""

You seem like the type of person to tell a guy not to buy anime figures or merch because its ""women repellent"" despite a very large demographic of said merch are also women. Despite women making entertainment like that. songs. Vtubers. adult audios. fan fictions. But a guy? A guy into that stuff? Awful? am i right to think you believe a guy indulging that merch to be a sexist or mysoginist? 

I see it in TwoX all the time too. ""Only abusers indulge porn"" ""only sexists like porn"" ""porn isnt normal for men and normal men dont like porn""

Well as a feminist, a female and a mental health professional. shut the fuck up. Stop demonizing every. fucking. thing. men. do.

Sex is healthy. Porn is okay. Female is not an offensive word. Social media, because of people like you, is increasing depression and lessening social interaction. people are afraid to talk to others. Here you are, faceless, on the internet telling others how to talk and act IRL. If you this petty about this topic I can only imagine how far your toxicity goes. people like you aid misinformation and enhance mental health problems. please. fucking stop.

**You just want to control other based on shitty stereotypes and act like the messaih of language. You know woman was and has been used negatively just as female has and can be right? Like, no word is protected from being used negatively and cherry picking the use from a minorty of ""incels"" (which is a legitimate mental health problem andbsocial issue inbsociety andbi dont mean the toxic incels. I mean people genuinely unable to socialize and find partners) is a piss poor argument to suggest someone is speaking incorrectly**

&gt; It's just out crazying the crazy.

Imagine being this stupid or being like OP you people are the ones fucked in the head.

You know women call themselves females as an identity right?

Look at r mildlyinfuriating right now. ""female here on a flight""

A week or ago there was ""Female escort ask me anyhing"" in r iama or whatever it was.

Many women say ""I like this female character""

**Go on twitch and look at the female tags**

Fuck people like you lot policing langauge bases on your own hateful and limited perceptions and interpretarions of how and who uses it.

""Oh its obviously incels reducing women to a gender""

First. you are applying a negative stereotype and applying it to everyone and being the same exact reductionist you claim others to be.

Second. You use the worst connotations to justify this irrational language policing as if there is no other context.

Third. you lot pretend like people will only say female but never male when they often will.

Fourth. Female and women are now considered different so it helps narrow down gender and sex based identity with one word rather than ""I am a cishet woman"" so its faster to type and convey identity in a much simpler and comfortable way for people.

Fifth. Saying women is literally and can literally be just as negative in use. ""Get me a sandwich women"" or ""you talked to the woman about this?""

So dont pretend like ""woman"" cant have as many and has been used just as negatively by mysoginists or sexists. If you want to play the incel card with ""female"" anyone with a functioning brain can prove the same with the word woman being used just as negatively.

Never mind extreme feminsists who find ""woman"" offensive or do we igbore their language policing because they are irrstional? But not like you people right? How could YOU be irrational when its YOU offended by language right?

Now, making fun of assholes like you is fun but lets move back to ""self identifying females"" or ""women who call themselves females"" or ""women who call others females"" 

**Let me guess, you gaslight them by saying something like ""you have no respect for yourself"" right? I hear it all the fucking time from people like you**

Lets be clear. You people, the ones like OP, yourself and that fool with the ""WhAt SpEcIes"" quip like they are one upping someone are not heroes you think you are. The fact is you are comfortable, petty and sad individuals making a problem out of nothing because you cant see past your own god damn personal preference and with what little, tiny outrage you can muster online want to control how others speak based on a small subset ofbtr population and their stereo types.

**Grow. the. fuck. up.**

Because emulating fiction to ""one up"" a circle jerk created strawman makes you a hero. Keep patting eachother on back.

Its not like studies show more depression and less social interaction between people IRL due to anxiety for how they may be percieved right? Oh wait... that is the case. especially in youths......**

But keep up the gate keeping.

keep up the stereo types.

soc_608065,socialskills,reddit_comment,302,"In person, I look for social cues so it depends on your delivery. Wrong kind of delivery makes me think you’re secretly SOS-ing and I start basically wondering if your suicidal tendencies are my problem and stuff (I’m relatively detached and don’t have many friends).

Also despite my detachment and natural pessimism I try to focus on being positive and self-improving, so self-depreciating humour can quickly go from “haha same”/s to “you are insanely depressing”.
I’m also a strong believer in the power of words because when I was in high school, simply telling myself that [a language I hated] was easier was enough to make learning it easier too. Prior to this, I was adamant and stubborn about learning (I am still basically stubborn but not about this anymore) That comes with the subconscious/conscious process of making yourself more open-minded to possibilities of success. It doesn’t work for everything all the time, and it’s not as easy as succeeding just because you say it, but it’s a big process step to say “I can”.
The Japanese term for this is “kotodama” (言霊), which is “word soul” aka the power of words.

Related*: I hate the toxic spread on Facebook and instagram of ‘public depressioners’(“Hi my name is Clara and I’m 19 years old female and depressed”) and depression normalisers (“#feel like killing myself on a Monday” “omg same” “slit my throat please”).  I am happy that mental illness is less stigmatised, and less happy that it’s being treated as “it’s normal to have it and you’re lying if you’re not” by some of my peers.

* I suppose I can expand more if asked

Conclusively, you attract different people with your words. Self-depreciating “kill me everyday” humour won’t get you anywhere with someone who’s consciously trying hard to see life better."
soc_1170245,socialskills,reddit_comment,415,"Hey there!

I think understanding and getting to the root of the cause of why you people please is the best way to start. Because lack of self esteem, self confidence, and people pleasing are symptoms of a bigger issue. Until you work out that then you will often fall into old habits.

I’ll give you an example as we kinda sound similar in terms of what I used to do allllll the time. Growing up I was the younger sibling. My brother often got the majority of attention and often I became the scapegoat. In many ways it felt like I was the least important person in the house and it didn’t matter what I did while my brother was the golden child and did nothing wrong.Regardless I turned to academic study and excelled even though my parents never acknowledged it. Basically I did everything I could to get that validation that I was doing something good and right. This is all steeped in neglect from my parents. 

This meant that I would often push myself to excel. Getting validation and told I was doing a good job pushed me harder. It also meant filling my life with people who would take that for granted as they knew I would do anything to feel validated (obviously not vindictively but you know). This meant that not only was my past filled with those traumas and poor coping mechanisms but my present was reinforcing them.

As for feeling confident in your decision and not wanting to harm anybody else. Every decision in your life is going to be the wrong decision for somebody. Every feeling you have is going to contradict the feeling another person has. 

What you need to consider is what the harm of that decision has on both the main parties involved and on yourself. For example those people singing poorly on shows doesn’t harm anybody. Maybe they are blind to their lack of talent but it doesn’t harm anybody in them trying. It sounds like you are super empathetic which means that you probably are not the kind of person to make rash and significantly harmful decisions without considering the consequences. 

Forget right and wrong. The concept is completely black and white. Decisions in the real world are more like shades of grey. There isn’t a way to be perfect and please everyone. There is a big difference in being self confident and self aware to being self confident and self absorbed."
soc_176876,socialskills,reddit_comment,857,"Guideline assumption: Everyone is interesting.

The question you're asking in my experience is the rational start to begin finding better ways to make connections. Like learning how to walk or toss a ball, the desire is there while the skill is missing.

Walking takes practice to strengthen the muscle and changes in mindset  (mostly moving work to being unconscious) as the muscles come in, so does conversation. The first change you might find is your question comes from an odd point of focus. It's like asking ""how do I keep myself standing up without strength?"" The answer is you cannot, you will fall but to get strong enough to stand you'll fall as a natural path to gain strength. Very much the model of ""Fake it till you become it.""

So here's my two cents. Most people will tell you the actions you'll make, ""focus on key words, build a statement and a question from them, ask questions."" They are the practice, the workout, the regimen.

I'll answer your question straight. ""How do I sustain a conversation without having a common interest?"" You do not, will not sustain it without *interest*. Interest is what keeps a conversation alive.

There are two sides on a conversation, sometimes the roles flip but at any given point there is a listener and a speaker. A speaker does exactly what you think, they speak. You know how to be a speaker. If someone comes up to you and asks about something you love, you will gush, singing its praises and complexity. You have deep knowledge on what you love, if not details of how it works or what it is then in details of how it feels, your experiences, how it changes your life. Speaking is easy, when not crippled by anxiety.

So... is listening easy? It's a problem that comes up with what listening implies, it sounds like the role of listener is ""hearing"" someone. You do hear someone when listening, you do understand someone when listening but that is not what you do specifically when being a listener. You provide *interest* when conversing as a listener. You *are* interested. Remember times when talking with someone was easy, you knew enough about them, their day, their hobbies to be interested in them. So asking questions was a natural extension of your interest in their well-being, their day, their hobby.

So back to the guideline, everyone is interesting. If you want a conversation to stay rolling, you must communicate your interest. The passion, that powerful emotion of being interested is what makes a conversation move, live, and thrive.

So if you're going up to a person to be friends you do have a common interest. Them. That's what the conversation is always about, the speaker. As a listener you're only job is to convey how much you want to listen, how valuable each moment shared is going to be.

If you were brash, it would boil down to:
""You are interesting. Why?"" because you don't know why they're interesting yet. Is it their friend's circle, what they do, how attractive they are, their body language? If they were boring you wouldn't want to talk with them, the interaction would be worthless to you.

So with that in mind, rather than focusing on what to say at each juncture, juggling sentences like a wordsmith, instead focus on your motivation. That inquisitive fire, that thing that wants you to be friends with them. That thing that makes them interesting to you, figure out what that thing is, be honest with yourself. ""Why are they interesting?"" If you dig, dig, and dig and can't find it. Sometimes we don't know where to look but the more conversations you have the better you'll learn what interests you in a person.

Just remember you can love a hobby, you might love DOTA 2 or League of Legends, you might be a fan of anime and not know it. So if you want to find out, a person already in the hobby is more ready to show you the way even if it's just a point in the direction instead of a hand hold down the road. Are their hobbies what you really want to talk about? Or is it because they're doing it, how they interact with the hobby that's interesting? If you go in with the intent to be friends, then you're asking ""why is this person interesting enough to be around them, why is this person fun?"" If you find out why, then you've found out why they are friend material. In return they get to find out what in you is interesting to them.

In closing, everyone has a common interest, themselves. You can talk about yourself forever, so can they. People love to talk about themselves. So genuinely show you are interested and open them up as a speaker. Remember a child may know nothing about an object or subject other than furiously pointing at it but they are intensely interested in what it is. When you know absolutely nothing about something you start at the bottom. Just keep that passion burning."
soc_1328475,socialskills,reddit_comment,349,"I think it depends on how you’d confront them.

I’ve ghosted people before and it sucked. I’ve been ghosted before and it really sucked. 

The first time I didn’t know why it happened. My friends simply stopped answering my texts. The second time I knew because one person out of all my friends had the curtesy of informing me of what was going on (lot of shit talking from someone who didn’t know me that hurt all of what I had thought were friendships). I didn’t confront any of them because I had no way to contact them and figure out what was going on.

In the situation above. The few people who still wanted to talk to me I ghosted. Why did I ghost them? As it turns out it was because I have trauma responses (such as Avoidant tendencies and social anxiety) that caused me to break off my relationship (didn't know this until I sought therapy afterwards). This is also coupled with the fact that they already knew of the situation and were trying to make me make amends with someone who has had their friends and family tell me to kill myself and that I’m not worthy of friendship or love since I was 11-years old. Was it the best way to handle the situation? No, and I regret that a lot but at the same time I don’t see how I would have been able to stay friends with them through my panic attacks, flashbacks, and nightmares that plagued me after I ghosted and was ghosted.

As a result of the situation above, they confronted me by posting pictures on FaceBook of me out of context that showed me in a bad light and insinuated that nobody liked me and that I was a problem which made my mental health get even worse than it was.

If you understand why it’s happening, then I suggest letting it go.

If you don’t understand then talk to them and ask why. Confront them in person and, in some cases, by phone if they’ll answer.

Edit: Format"
soc_619676,socialskills,reddit_comment,1033,"Okay first of all the answer to all is incredibly situational. My first piece of advice is learn how to read body language and non verbal ques. This might be really hard for some people but timing and reading someone's energy as to whether they're even receptive to initiating conversation is huge. 

Timing in a conversation is also really important. As is receptivity. If the person you're talking to is in a rush or seems unenthusiastic about continuing (try to leave, backing up, doesn't offer conversation back) let them go. They might be into it another day or they might just not like you. 

Not everyone is going to like you. A lot of people literally hate me because I project authentic self -confidence that they are trying to project. It's very much a narcissist/empath dynamic that I've fallen into in many situations. Don't sweat it. They probably suck. Not everyone is good people. 

Listen in a conversation. Don't be planning what you're going to say while the other person is speaking. People LOVE to talk about themselves...LET THEM. I passed my drivers license because I asked the exam lady questions about her son and her experience in her job and she happily talked the whole time. I passed with flying colours. People will get turned off if you start with a lot of I statements and only seem interested in yourself. 

Start slow. You can't become friends with everyone and nothing happens all at once. I'm a social butterfly and there have been times in my life when I had no friends. Get to be your own best friend. Yes I went to movies and got food and even went travelling and to plays alone. If you have an authentic relationship with yourself you'll attract similar people. Find something you're interested in and participate in that community. It's the most organic way to meet people. And you're more likely to find people with the same personality types as you. I made the most friends with people who shared my passions and interests. 

I've joined many clubs and taken classes. Sometimes I don't click with anyone and that's cool. Sometimes I meet an acquaintance and a few times I've met a best friend. It's not the number but the quality. If you have one or two friends work on those relationships and learn from them. 

Not everything is easy. There have been many times I'm shy or insecure or have been young and anxious socially. It's normal. Most people feel some degree of social anxiety and nobody feels that relaxed. That's why people like me often become the joiner of people at parties or the entertainer. 

ALWAYS INTRODUCE YOURSELF WITH A HANDSHAKE. Don't make it wimpy or too aggressive. Short and sweet. Physical contact immediately reduces people's defensiveness and opens them up to you. 

Approaching a group. Make your way into the group and hold space by slowly making your full body facing with everyone else. Most groups naturally gather in circles so everyone can see each other's mouths. Don't lurk outside or to the side it's weird. Don't charge in either. Remember timing and reception. If you don't know anyone when there's a gap in the conversation introduce yourself to the person next to you. Say how you're affiliated to the group ""I know So and so from such place"". Often times someone else will be watching you two shake hands and if you catch their eye you can open up to more handshakes and introductions. 

Ask a relevant question. How do you guys know so and so? Or how do you like that class you're all in? 

Asking questions, listening, adding more, allowing them to add something, listening and responding. 

Give non creepy compliments. Nothing opens someone up faster than a well-placed NONSEXUAL compliment. 

Example: hey that was a really good question you asked it really helped me. Don't expect anything in return or even a conversation. Give it as an offering. The next time you meet they will likely be more open to talking with you. 

I love your outfit. This looks amazing on you. Can I just say that haircut suits you so well. 

Or. I just wanted to say that you did a really good presentation. I thought you were really confident while public speaking. 

Be specific not creepy. 

A well timed joke is a great way in. If you're not the joke type then laugh appropriately when others make jokes. People look to see who approves of their humour and will be more open joking with you. 

Have a pleasant look on your face. Smile. Laugh. 

Fake it til you make it. I don't always feel confident. But in situations that demand confidence I make sure to stand or sit up straight and project confidence. The energy your project is really important. If you're freaking out people can feel it and it doesn't feel good does it? Everyone likes someone who has a relaxed and self assured way about them. Even if you don't feel it, look and be the part. Wear fitting clothes and decent shoes. Smell good. If someone is close enough to smell you make sure it smells good. Scent and memory are super tied together and a good scent will linger longer in the memory than you think. 

Shoulder back. Back straight. Head up. Wear sunglasses if you don't like to look people in the eyes but at normal times and not indoors obviously. Nobody is perfect looking but if you're put together neatly then you won't stand out or set off alarm bells. 

Most people are as scared of you as you are of them. Like spiders. Be friendly. Receive friendliness.

Be yourself even if you're weird. Be your weird self and find fellow weirdos. If someone doesn't like you fuck them seriously. Just move on. Cultivate good people by being good people. Be helpful and honest and yourself. Put effort into your relationships. And put effort into your relationship with yourself.

Edit: Thank you for the silver! I wrote this massive essay last night not thinking it would help anyone but I'm really glad people found some valuable advice in it."

I am sorry you have struck out with meds and therapists. If it helps, think of therapists and meds like trying on shoes or clothes. You may think, “this outfit is really cute,” but then it is too short when you try it on. Dialectical behavioral therapy might be beneficial if you haven’t tried it yet. Be sure to get a therapist that specializes in it. Or, you could even try group therapy. Another thing you might be able to try is getting lab work done (getting thyroid, hormone, etc. levels checked). All that being said, it is understandable why you feel frustrated and discouraged. Making connections with people can be extremely difficult, especially if you have experienced trauma in childhood. Trauma can stunt emotional growth during childhood, so the way you are feeling now is almost certainly not your fault (I can’t say for certain because I don’t know you).

I don't know man, I guess from what I learned from your experiences, maybe we should...huh.

Maybe there is no clear answer. Maybe be yourself when it comes to your good qualities or things that you know are acceptable, and try to hide your less qualities from others and work on them in private.

If one thing IS clear, however, (this is something you addressed) it's that we need to consider the feelings of ourselves and others. It sounds simple, but from someone who sadly is your ""average Redditor,"" I struggle with it a lot because I tend to act impulsively and I get overly sensitive sometimes.

Idk bro. Maybe there's a way to be charismatic and have social skills without trading yourself away. Perhaps Carl Jung has the answer. Integrating your persona (the face you show to the rest of the world) and your shadow (the real you you lock away). Ideally, you want to work on your flaws in private and adopt traits of the person you want to be seen as in public. Again, way easier said than done. But perhaps it's something to aspire to.

Eh, just my two cents. I'm not gonna dig into your opinion about social skills. The way I see it, I think that's a fair opinion to have and it's understandable to be frustrated, based on the experiences you shared with us.

soc_1335299,socialskills,reddit_comment,417,"Something I’ve learned after many disappointing birthdays is it is really up to you to make the day special for yourself.  I always take off work, get my free Starbucks drink, take myself out for a meal, go do something fun I’ve been meaning to do like visit a park or new city.  I let people know my birthday is coming up and if they ask what I’m doing I tell them and offer to include them, but I don’t get upset if they can’t.  I make a big point to make other people’s birthdays special because it is fun for me and something I enjoy doing, I don’t expect reciprocity because, frankly, they don’t owe it to me and not many people seem to love birthdays as much as I do.  

My birthday was yesterday, so I think we have the same birthday, and I spent the majority of the day alone.  My mom met me for coffee around 11 and I played poker with some friends late at night, and I don’t think most of them knew it was my birthday.  I had one of the best days I’ve had in a while though.  Life has the value that you give to it. It’s not the responsibility of others to add value to your life.  It’s just a bonus when they do.  

I know how hard it is seeing “popular” people get a bunch of birthday shout outs and sweet pictures and stuff on socials, knowing that it isn’t going to happen for me—it sucks.  One of my best friends growing up is such a genuine, pure hearted, beautiful human and has so many more friends than I do, her birthday is the day after mine and I used to feel really outshined by her every year.  I don’t really know how to make that better for you, once again, I have just stopped expecting it.  I know it isn’t going to happen.  I am really grateful when my grandparents and aunts and uncles call or post on my Facebook.  Sometimes you have to appreciate what you have instead of focusing on what you don’t. 

Last: I’m not sure about your friends, but just because my friends can’t hang w me on my birthday doesn’t make them bad friends.  Life happens, people have jobs and families and plans and things going on.  They can love you and be unavailable on your birthday, they are not mutually exclusive.

You know I'm actually happy that I got abused, makes me realize I just don't fit in and people aren't worth being too acquainted with. I'm fine, I have my movies and my photography's going well, hope to get my business going this year, I'm going to make 2019 my bitch, this is the year I finally get out of this depressed slim, nobody's going to bring me down anymore, fuck them they can't get to me anymore, I'm the king of my mind, master of my fate and captain of my Soul. There's a saying, ""whatever you think about the most is your god"" well if that's true, I'm not going to let them be my god, they mean nothing to me, movies, photography, my writing, poetry, and philosophy are my interests, they are my gods, no, I am my god, I won't get anywhere dwelling on my past I just need to concentrate on my future, hell I have so many more things to worry about than them, they're small, and every time I get closer to my dreams they become smaller, soon they'll become tiny, they'll always be there but everything else in my life will becomes so much bigger than them. Thinking about them will just take my mind off of other more important things which only postpones me from reaching my goals, I'm going to stop thinking about the little things. No more thinking about the past, I will live in the present and walk towards the future.

Thanks so fucking much OP!!! Writing that shit really helped, I wish you a great fucking year, anyway take my advice, those people who made fun of you only did it to make themselves feel better than you, which means if they feel the need to do so they're clearly not, they're little, so make them little, if you keep on thinking about them they'll become bigger, stop thinking about them, think about your dreams, your passions, all the things you love make them big  and make those people smaller, don't let them become big, don't let them be your god, be the king of your mind, the captain of your soul and the master of your life.

When you get reminded of them or any other bad thoughts, acknowledge them as nothing more than a a negative thought in your mind then deal with them by doing something productive, do something your passionate about, if you haven't then find those passions try new hobbies, focus on becoming good at those and soon you'll forget the bad thoughts.

soc_1240399,socialskills,reddit_comment,160,"You have to decide your personal boundaries in advance and voice them early on if you can. the moment someone crosses or begins to cross a boundary, be firm but kind and tell them your not cool with whatever is happening. If they continue just ask them if they didn’t understand what you said. Then they are given a choice to explain if maybe they didn’t get it or they respond in some way that makes it clear they heard you and didn’t care. Then you have the evidence to respond and point out they blatantly disregarded what you said. 

How they respond at this point will show you the person isn’t considerate of others and sometimes you can’t change people and it’s not how your acting. Or it can make them see that they are being dismissive and opens the possibility to improve the situation. 

I’ve struggled with this too and I hope this made sense and maybe helps!"
soc_1512999,socialskills,reddit_comment,120,"Stick to dating apps but also make your profile ""girl-next-door""-y which usually attracts guys who are looking for gfs. Also helps if you make romantic gestures like making a playlist. Could be that you are simply in an area where the ratio is skewed. And this one might come off as too cynical, but I'd try to see if you have unrealistic standards for guys. That definitely prevented a lot of my female friends from getting with dudes who would have been great for them but they just didn't know what they wanted and went off of other people's standards.

soc_1084523,socialskills,reddit_comment,149,"I feel you on this one. There comes a time when you gotta not care about what others think in order for you to grow. In this case you’ll gain the ability to control who really is in your life. Everything you just told Reddit should be told to him. In person so he sees how serious you are. Or through text but you said regardless he’d come see u in person. And do not, I repeat do not let any attempts of persuasion get to you. Or guilt. Stand firm on your decision. Tell that person it’s best for yourself to dissociate yourself from him as you feel he is holding you back or bringing you down with the character he carries on a daily basis. It’ll be bad for your health if you don’t. Stop thinking and just do. You are your own restraint I’m this case."
soc_1478645,socialskills,reddit_comment,260,"Depending on how close you are with the person, I'd maybe gently bring it up. As someone with pretty bad depression who also is bad at getting back with people, something like a ""Hey, just checking in...you haven't responded for a while, is everything okay?"" might just mean a lot depending on what they're going through. Even if their only response is a blanket ""Yes, sorry for not responding."", that's at least something. 

I tend to withdraw from social situations, and I have a hard time responding to texts. Then when enough time has passed and I do have a response in mind, I feel anxious about sending it so late. It's a cycle, in my case, and I haven't found a great fix for it yet unfortunately.

But honestly there's not much else besides that that can be done. If they haven't responded in so long, what harm could it do to gently ask them why? Just know that it may be something personal that they're working through, or they may have trouble articulating their thoughts. 

The important thing to note for you is that your feelings are also valid. I would completely understand someone's anger and frustration toward me for not responding to even simple texts. They may have stuff going on, but that also doesn't invalidate your feelings about it. You have to decide if you want to continue to have that person im your life, because you are responsible foe your mental health and yours alone. Life's too short to keep pouring energy into one-sided relationships."

But I don't know if you feel bad if that happened. If you would, then maybe you could try to figure out why.

soc_724993,socialskills,reddit_comment,309,"I don't know that you two are compatible. If she's asked you to do drugs with her, and you've declined but have let her know that you are not uncomfortable with her doing drugs, and she still determines that doing drugs with her partner is something she wants in a relationship, then the relationship isn't going to work out. It doesn't make either of you bad or boring...just...not compatible. Know your limits and boundaries and talk to her. Maybe think up some fun experiences that you would really love to share with her. 

""I like you. I am comfortable with you experimenting with drugs. It is your choice and I respect that. I am (ok/not ok) if you do drugs around me. I am choosing to not do drugs. I don't expect to change my mind, and ask that you respect my choice. Please know that regardless of my choice not matching your choice, I care about you and want you to know that you can always call if you need to. Even though I don't want to do drugs, I would really love to experience these things with you. Is there anything in this list that would interest you?""

....maybe a bit less robotic, but you get the idea. You are welcome to explain why you do not want to do them, but I think it's important that you don't turn the conversation into trying to convince her to not do them. If she leaves you for this choice, then it might suck for a bit, but it would be better than a lot of paths the relationship could potentially take at that point.

Edit: also, if you aren't comfortable with her doing drugs, then you should let her know that it's a deal breaker for you and then stand by that. Be ruthless for your own well-being."
soc_510528,socialskills,reddit_comment,389,"Late, but I wanted to contribute. You seem kind. This may just be my personal preference but...

### Be patient, and be chill.

I get that you are keen to show that you're really friendly and smiley and interested in me, but just be a bit chill. You have to meet me where I'm at. 

E.g. when a guy who became a close friend for a while strolled up to me in a school car park and asked me advice about his hair.

E.g. When I worked on tills in retail the customers that I felt comfortable with were those who were genuine and chill, almost mellow. Just asking genuine questions (not super personal of course) or sharing their thoughts. This particular girl was really good with this, so much so that I wrote about her in my journal. She just quietly ramble, and then she would smile and look at me like she really wanted to know what I thought about it. And if I didnt kmow what to say it wouldn't phase her, she'd just go back to rambling some more. 

I'm not sure I can give you specific topics. Do avoid the dreaded ""how are you?"" which puts undue pressure on him to open him, and to calculate what type of answer is appropriate. Do ask anything else to comes to mind. If you get a short answer he might not have anything to say on the topic. He also may be slow to get his thoughts out, so watch his face and maybe stay silent for a while to give him space to say something. I stress, just be chill. If you can show that you arent impatient or bored or phased by his quietness/awkwardness he will grow comfortable around you. (I also really like a dose of unexpected bluntness, it's just honest, but that might not be appreciated by everyone!)

And scrolling down I'd have to agree with the others about one-on-one settings being by far more comfortable. 

EDIT: I'd also be careful with laughing at my bad jokes (not that any of my jokes are bad, of course...). Because one of my biggest turn offs is fakeness, and the feeling that everyone is being a bit fake in social situations is a big part of the awkwardness and frustration that comes with socialising."

Then there are the people that really take it personally and assume you don't like them anymore or something crazy.

If you don’t feel strongly that she wants you, it might be best not to bother asking. Just keep it fun and casual, keep flirting, it’s good practice.

Why are you posting in spaces like this, probably to say you ""reached out"" and pat yourself on the back.

You are the one hosting and planning this event.  You get to make the rules.

As u/DerangedPoetess points out, if your mom lives with you then that complicates things a little but does not change the underlying bottom line.   

Obviously, if your mom is dead set against it, then it will create friction and we generally try not to have friction with family.  Only you know your specific situation but some battles are worth fighting.

If you have to include your mom, then maybe you can think of a way to get her to buy in and to want to include the co-worker.

Try to connect at a deeper level with your ""fake"" friends. See if you can get them to connect with you at a deep level as well. I've done my best to connect personally with others and this has allowed me to weed out those who are not true friends from those who are. Also, once you can connect better to people, they will include you more. I wish you the best!

Here are some ways that I attempt to connect with others:
- Ask for help with something they are good at (and you need help with)
- Ask about something that both of you could be interested in (if it turns out that they aren't, no problem! Try again.)
- Compliment them on something that they are **passionate** about; this is a very good one because by complimenting them, you are creating a lot of connections
- whatever you think of!

soc_1064775,socialskills,reddit_comment,361,"Downvote my other comment if you want, but I'm talking from experience. I grew up with adhd. Best part is, I never even knew I had it. I never took action to control it. It caused me to be an annoying ass kid. I was outcasted and bullied a lot. I was in your place at one point, hating the phrase ""just be yourself"" and cursing anyone who used it.

But the thing you have to realize is that you're not defined by your shortcomings. Being yourself doesn't mean doing nothing about your flaws. You're annoying? Fix it. You have a shit personality? Fix it. You are still being yourself, you are simply trying to become the best version of yourself.

It's when you start trying to act cool and mimic what others are doing for the sake of fitting in that you are no longer being yourself. Bullying a kid because others are bullying them, even though I myself hated bullies. Playing a sport I had no interest in because family and friends wanted me to. And then there are some darker things I'd rather not talk about that I did, all for the sake of fitting in. It all led to more self-loathing and embarrassment. The bullying slowly stopped but now I fucking hated life.

Quit identifying yourself based off your flaws. Who you are is defined by your core beliefs. When you aren't being yourself is when you start going against what you believe in. You can change for the better and still remain yourself. It's when people lose themselves that they start going down a darker path.

If you want to ignore my advice though, I won't discourage it. I learned a lot about who I was because of the decisions I've made in the past. You likely will too. But I'm trying to clear things up for you now so that maybe you won't have to learn the hard way and go through that pain. But that's your decision to make. I know I would've been stubborn and probably wouldn't be listening to myself right now. Let me know if you come to a different conclusion"

You will need to set boundaries with people like this who don't understand social cues very well, you may have to set boundaries with your parents if they have no regard for your schedule or what you want, and your employer who will try to make you work on weekends. 

There are so many scenarios in which setting boundaries will be important. So I'm not going to tell you exactly how to do it because this is something you will need to get better at as well, so even if you hurt his feelings, that's fine. You'll learn from it.

soc_50830,socialskills,reddit_comment,281,"Something that hasn't been suggested here yet is to see a competent hypnotherapist. From what I've read, oftentimes a stammer can be traced back to a particular incident during childhood, which a hypnotherapist can help you revisit and (in theory) help you change your perspective on it.

For example, the book ""Hypnotherapy"" by Dave Elman quotes several examples of patients who stammered. One of them (off the top of my head) started because when he was young, there was a traumatic incident, which when he was questioned about it, made him stutter because he didn't know what to say at the time. This translated to a problem throughout the rest of his life with stuttering when nervous or even in casual conversation. The therapist was able to ""talk"" his ""subconscious"" into believing that this event was just a one-off and shouldn't have any bearing on his life, and lo and behold, the patient stopped stuttering.

There will be some who say that there's no evidence base for hyponosis, apart from anecdotal evidence, but tbh if you're a stammerer, you might as well try it. I stammered from a young age (and still do, a little bit) - it improved throughout high school but was still annoying with certain letters and words (Ns, Gs, Ds in particular). After reading about hypnotherapy and learning the theory behind it, I saw a hypnotherapist and I THINK it may have helped. Ofc, it could be the placebo effect talking, but since that one session, I have stammered far less (if at all) on N and G words, which was what I had told the hypnotist about.

Just my two cents - it's worth a try."
soc_431401,socialskills,reddit_comment,177,"
I have the same problem, and for me it think it is because i subconsciously want to be underestimated or to just not be perceived as i truly am maybe out of shyness or fear of judgment. silliness is a mask that blocks negativity and harsh comments because you can just use the excuse that ""you were being silly"" on purpose (for the others but more importantly for yourself). i am on a path to try to correct this by practicing my interactions with smaller groups and trying my best to filter out all that would be considered too silly or unfunny. i rate my jokes in my head and think about all the people who would disapprove of this joke before telling it. the percentage of approval and intensity of approval needed are up to you, but i aim for approximately 75% laughs and maximum 5% disapproval or else you could get yourself in an unwanted debate. choose your words carefully when you know you dont share much common values with the people you are with."

Other days we barely talk alllll day. I used to think this reflected some deeper meaning about the nature of our relationship. I know now that it's over-thinking it. Some days we feel like being social; other days we feel less like it. It's normal and it's ok to be quiet some days. I know for a fact that I'm on the lower-end of the ""social"" spectrum and that's fine.

soc_10020,socialskills,reddit_comment,322,"The following advice will likely give you a panic attack even as you read it:  Don't say anything, but do something that shows you have romantic interest.  Flirt with the girl, touch her, tease her.  You will know very quickly how she feels, whether she is comfortable with that behavior or not.

This gives you the benefit of getting the information you need, how she feels, without putting either of you in an awkward spot.  You say something, no matter how it is framed, you are never going back to where you were.  You get a little flirty and it doesn't go, nothing has ""officially"" changed.

Second, you want to engage her emotionally, not logically.  Saying, in any method ""do you have romantic feelings for me"" creates a ton of pressure on her to say ""no.""  It puts her on the spot, makes her anxious, and she might not know herself.  However, if your behavior starts to change, she can feel it out with you.  

The thing is, and keep this in mind, you aren't really sure you want a romantic relationship with this girl.  I'm sure you know her pretty well, but there is a lot to anyone else that we don't, and can't ever, know, and you have no doubt filled in the blanks with optimistic assumptions (we all do that).  There is no harm in taking your time.

If things go really south, you can always write off your actions as you being in a silly or playful mood or whatever works for you without doing massive harm to the relationship.

Before I finish, let me put this another way to help out with your next question:  Right now you probably have instinctual reactions to her, things you want to say or do that you suppress out of fear of rejection.  Let those out a little.  That's the real you.  Let her react to that and see what happens."
soc_22369,socialskills,reddit_comment,347,"College is a funny time of life for a majority of people. You meet so many new people in a short amount of time and people tend to come and go at the drop of a hat. People in college tend to move around to different circles of friends simply because of the type of lifestyle it is. People flunk or drop out, some graduate, some transfer colleges, some let their social circle get so big that sometimes it's hard to fit everyone in while studying.  

It sounds like you're a nice enough person but ask yourself if people only come to you when they want you to do them a favor or do they hang out with you for the hell of it and you occasionally do them favors? It could be that you need to evaluate who you call a friend because they may be using you. I don't know you and don't know your situation so that's your call to make. 

Lots of people are also fair weathered friends which are some of the worst friends to have. They want to be around you when everything in your life is wonderful but they leave at the first sign of you needing a helping hand. Save yourself the headache and avoid these at all costs.

As you get older and graduate you will find that those 20 or 30 people you thought were really good friends drift away. You will always have the memories and good times but a true, lifelong friend is really hard to come by. Count yourself lucky if you can find 1 or 2 really good friends who stick by you through thick and thin and who keep in contact with you long term.

As the person above stated, joining a club or extra curricular activity is a great way to meet people. Talking to people about homework and other school assignments or having study partners is another good way to meet people. Getting an on campus job or even off campus is another good one as well.  And good luck!!"
soc_398398,socialskills,reddit_comment,188,"All these suggestions are excellent.  I just want to add that in the future, maybe you don't really need the ""act"" to begin with.  Just be authentic rather than ""over\-generous"".  

If you are talking financially, and you are dating someone that expects you to pay every time you go out, that's not cool \- it's good to surround yourself with people who are inspired to contribute fairly, or are at least honest about their inability to do so beforehand and then it's up to you to support your entertainment habits.  

If you are talking about having an unnaturally pleasant attitude, you can clearly see that doesn't help you in the long run \(LOL\) because it creates an artificial precedent that must either be maintained or negated at some point.  

Agree with everyone, humor is important, but to me movie quotes are pretty telling, too.  Throw some quotes out from your favorite shows or movies to see if they are into the same genres and vibe, and that can open up a natural mode of inspired conversation that allows you both to drop your facades.  Best wishes to you!"
soc_1433236,socialskills,reddit_comment,1359,"That sounds hard, I'm sorry.  I hope your health improves.

One thing I'd say is that age does help.  The younger you are, for the most part, the more people will just be assholes for no reason.  Also, on more of a bell curve that you're near the top of (unfortunately), young people will connect your importance to your physical appearance, rather than your personality or anything like that.

Social anxiety and having few friends kind of feed into each other in a loop.  So not having friends might be caused by the social anxiety, and the social anxiety is probably at least in part caused by not having friends.

Part of what helped me to break the cycle was just trying and failing a lot.  I wanted friends more than I wanted to avoid the pain of trying.  On that journey I realized that rejection hurt way less than the fear I sat in while not trying to meet people.  It's tough and it's never so simple as ""just do it,"" but I'll try to give some more details on some things you could try.

Your circumstances probably aren't very fair, but changing them can only really come from someone in your life choosing to help, or from you.  It's hard, but it's possible, to learn how people tick well enough to make yourself so likable that making friends is something you can do in any context.  Sometimes you're blessed with friends, and sometimes you figuratively claw and scrape your way to social aptitude to acquire them.  That's kind of what I did.  It took a few years to really get decent at it, but I was always improving from my effort even though it hardly felt like it.

So how do you get better at people?  Practice is one way.  Think about what kind of relationships you want, what kind of things you want to do, then try.  

It's hard to overcome the fear of rejection, but what helps me is to think of the risks.  Are you losing anything trying to make a friend?  Not really.  If this person is already not-your-friend, then if you get rejected, nothing changed.  Sometimes the fear feels like you're afraid of losing this person as a friend if you get rejected, but that's a type of self-delusion, because it assumes that this person *is* your friend if you don't say anything.  Try not to let your emotions trick themselves into believing that ""not being rejected"" is the same as ""being accepted.""  Really, you just rejected yourself if you don't try, and the result is the same.  As for negative consequences, you might even be ridiculed in the worst of scenarios, but for me at least that still hurts less and for a shorter time than the anxiety and the loneliness, so it's worth the risk.

Reading is another way, that's less anxiety-inducing.  You *can* learn social skills from books, but you'll never be a complete social adept from just reading, so you'll need to practice on real people eventually.  Something like Carnegie's *How to Win Friends and Influence People* might be good material.

Confidence is really effective, but it's hard to have it without a good basis unless you're really dumb.  So build a basis for it.  What I like to do is to focus on having good intentions toward other people, and then act according to those benevolent intentions.  That way, even if I make a mistake, I can do so with some confidence, and look back on it without self-loathing, because I remember that I was trying my best and had the other person or people's best interests in mind.  More recently that's backed up by my actual social skills that I've developed, but in situations where I have little experience, I can still move forward when I check myself, make sure I have good intentions, and acknowledge that I don't know what I'm doing yet, so it's ok to make mistakes.  When I do make a mistake, I look back and think, ""did I know better before doing that?"" and the answer is almost always ""no, I couldn't have known.""  It's easy to forget that with the curse of knowledge.  Now, you know it's a mistake, so you feel like you were stupid before.  But when you made the mistake, you had no way of knowing what would happen.  So give that version of you some credit.  She gave things a try with the tools at her disposal, and then learned a new thing when it didn't work.  That's a job well done.  And it's ok to be critical there too.  If you had a tool or a knowledge that could have informed you to not make the mintake, you can say ""oh, I should have been more careful, or thought about it a bit more, before making an attempt"" and maybe you can be more mindful next time.  So those are some of my thought processes that help me have some confidence and avoid being way too ashamed over small things.

Learning about people in practice is kind of a process of observation.  You say something, or do something, then pay close attention to how people react.  Try to think of *why* people react a certain way too.   A lot of times you get the reaction, or part of it, but you don't know what caused it.  You can theorize, but often early on your theories will be wrong and you might just put yourself down while doing that.  This is where it helps to ask other people who are more experienced.  Do you trust your family enough to ask them?  Or maybe is there a teacher who cares about you, that you could ask some social questions to?  Most people are just OK at best at giving social advice, but if you can provide specific and detailed context and targeted questions about a situation you were in that you didn't understand, often people can understand what happened, or at worst, give you some advice that's not necessarily accurate but is good for your self-esteem.  (""that's not your fault, she's just being a bitch"" fare—maybe there was something you could have done better, but your advisor here can't figure it out from the provided context.  But they do think you're a good person so they'll give you the benefit of the doubt in sour interactions)

Try not to implicitly trust the opinions and declarations of your peers.  When you're anxious and/or have poor self-esteem, it's common to feel like other people all speak the truth because they say things with confidence.  You don't feel confident, so that means you must be wrong, because if you knew things, you would say them confidently too, right?  Not so.  You can almost always learn from what other people say, but that doesn't mean you have to believe them.  Start with a neutral profile for people you don't understand well.  Anything they say might be true or a lie.  Don't question them to their face about everything, but be prepared to defend your thoughts if they attack with words.  If someone is rude to you in your first interaction, that should go to your profile of that person, not to your profile of yourself.  You will remember them as a rude person, not remember yourself as whatever they called you.  Sometimes people are right even when they're mean, but it's best if you decide for yourself using multiple sources.  If 30 different people tell you your shirt is offensive, there's something there, and you have to decide to say ""screw them, I'm sticking to my guns on liking/wearing this shirt"" or ""wow, this shirt gives a bad impression, maybe I should rethink why I like it so much.""  But one person shouldn't tear your self-image apart.  If one person is angry with you and says your elbow is ugly, it's ok to assume it was just meant to hurt and there's not really something you should self-analyze there.

Anyway, I've burned out of ideas on this.  But hopefully there's a few ideas in here that you can make use of."
soc_1301752,socialskills,reddit_comment,154,"Maybe I’m not understanding correctly, but it sounds like you want some magic words to make customers not annoyed that they can’t get their products. The biggest rule of customer service is to set expectations lower than what you can deliver. If you can’t promise any delivery date, people are going to be mad when you took their money with the promise they would receive it in a certain time frame. If you don’t live up to your end of the bargain you can expect to have angry customers to deal with. No words will change this. 

So it’s up to you, do you want to be totally honest and lose orders, or be dishonest and deal with angry customers?

Most businesses fail. It’s definitely a possibility you should be prepared to face as a business owner. Starting a business is very difficult and you can’t always figure out everything on your first try."
soc_676461,socialskills,reddit_comment,270,"Oof. In my experience, suffering through a friendship when you have romantic feelings isn't worth it, or even fair to the other person. That's of course such a personal decision, there isn't a right answer. 

At two different times in my life I developed crushes on good friends, and in both cases I decided to risk losing them by telling them. Both times their feelings weren't mutual, so I ended up losing them as friends. That sucked, but losing them sucked less than the heartbreak I felt being just friends. Plus, I think I had ulterior motives for remaining their close friends -- I hoped it would lead to something more. So it didn't feel fair that they were opening up to me and getting closer with very different intentions than mine. Both times I was able to get over them relatively quickly, more quickly than crushes that I kept secret. 

I'm glad they were part of my life, I don't regret telling them, and after both times I was able to move forward and start dating. I ended up finding my long-term boyfriend shortly after telling the most recent example. I'm so glad I told that friend, because that let me get over him and led me to my current SO! If I hadn't said anything I would have either kept crushing or kept wondering about ""what could have been.""

TLDR in my experience telling them is worth it because it lets you stop wondering and move forward. I think it's fair to the other person because it lets them know an aspect of your motives in the friendship."

soc_1269807,socialskills,reddit_comment,333,"&gt; Imagine if you and your friends were out and some weirdo came up to you guys and started talking. You’d want them to lowkey go away, right?

Nope. You know how when you want to go talk to your crush but you're afraid that as soon as you say hi she'll laugh at you, call you out in front of the whole crowd, and then they'll all laugh at you? You're doing the same thing here. You're envisioning the worst case scenario and then not acting on it because you're sure that's going to happen. 

The truth is, maybe they might be out for a night to enjoy themselves. But also maybe they're a fun loving bunch that would totally include you in their group. 

How do you know which it is? You dont. That's the hard part. That's why our brains try to protect us because we know bad results could come of putting yourself out there. But even though you cant guarantee a good outcome, there's a skill you can develop that helps you read the situation and intuitively know if your odds look better or worse. Kinda like card counting.

How do you develop this skill? The same way you do any other skill: Practice, explore, experience, fail, learn, succeed. I'm also going to offer up (with the possibility if getting downvoted) looking into various pickup artist books and video. No no, not the (saddle up next to her, immediately put your hand on her hip, and in your most manly voice say) ""Hey baby, I noticed you're lonely."" But instead things like where youre sitting in the room. How you present yourself. Looking for signs of interest. How long you stick around after an introduction. Being able to walk away and handle failure. Theres a large amount if social knowledge that's available in resources like that, unfortunately buried in with along with all the mysgynistic junk, that you can prime yourself with before you put yourself out there."
soc_1666073,socialskills,reddit_comment,347,"I'm 26F and I had a very similar experience to yours. Spent most of my time in college depressed and barely socializing. Actually now that I think about it, I don't have any friends from college lol. Didn't date either. I'm doing a lot better now. Here's some advice:

**First and foremost, you need to address the depression.** 

I say this because depression clouds your judgement. You could've went through college getting to experience all the things you missed out on, but still felt like shit at the end of the day because you're depressed. 

You could've gotten invited to the best parties but your depressed mind would be telling you shit like ""So what? Those people don't like you anyways!"" You see what I mean? So you gotta get this under control first so you have a clear picture of your situation, the obstacles (often times they're not as high or daunting as our depressed minds make us feel they are), etc.

If you're open to taking medication: Have you talked to your doctor? Have you tried anti-depressants? Everyone is different but I had good experiences with bupropion personally. Stopped taking it about 3 years ago.  

\- Don't dwell on the past or over what could've been. Acceptance is key to moving forward. You have to accept that you didn't have a typical college experience and then let it go. 

\- It sounds like you need to do some soul searching. What are your hobbies? What do you do for fun? What kind of person do you want to be? Why are you ""not good at friendships""? Etc. 

\- Your financial situation: What is your degree in? What job do you currently have? It also might be worthwhile to try asking career centric subs for advice. 

\- If you think it might be worth trying to reconnect with old friends, I say give it a shot. Ask if they'd be down to hang out or meetup to do something. If you don't want to reconnect with old friends, it's time to try to make new ones."
soc_102655,socialskills,reddit_comment,152,"It depends on how you feel about her.  Some of my female friends are just women I tried to hit on, failed because of whatever reasons, got friendzoned, and became friends with.  If you're really into a girl and it really tears you up that you're not seeing her, then you should probably phase her out of your life or else you're going to continue to be miserable.  Don't let her vent all her personal problems to you over the phone everyday and keep listening hoping that one day she'll develop feelings for you.  If you enjoy talking to her and you've accepted the fact that you're never going to be with her, then it's not always bad especially if she's just a cool person.  Maybe she even has a friend that she can introduce you to.  I find though most of the times it's better to just move on.

E: grammar"
soc_1304036,socialskills,reddit_comment,133,"I'd consider that as a friend but its entirely up to you. I feel like understanding that both people see eachother as friends is a thing you just get by body language like do they interact with you and are interested in your input? Then thats friends. 

Personally to me most people are friends no need for any special deep connection. Just positive interactions and chemistry.

For some people the word friend has a more deeper meaning where its a complex relationship where you can be your truest self the bad and the ugly. 

How would you describe a friend? 

And it should be fine to just ask or even if you see that person has a friend just nonchalant say "" I think you are great friend"" and see that person's reaction."
soc_443954,socialskills,reddit_comment,323,"Well, maybe some people could consider this weird and probably it depends on your culture. I mean, once happened that a friend did that when it was near my home and I still think it has been a very nice thing to do, in fact I still remember that day and liked it, but probably for some people is different.

It depends on the people I think, because it would like invite yourself to somebody else home.

I think it's human to consider self-inviting a bad thing to do, but I also think it's very social to consider self-inviting a good thing. It's a way to open yourself to other people. If you are in a group of friends who are used to self-invite themselves to other people's houses, well, this could be good because this mean they feel so confident with you to feel they can ask you to go to your home. It's that kind of thing who if exists makes a friendship stronger in my opinion.

But this is my mindset, I cannot pretend everybody to have it, some friends have it and some do not, I think the best friends usually are the ones who have this kind of mindset, because when you have this mindset and you meet another person with this mindset it's awesome. Never happened to me so far to meet people with the same mindset, so the best thing I can do is trying to get my friends into this, but the nearest people to this mindset are my favorite haha

So, to answer totally, probably it could be seen as self-inviting, so if your friends tell you this is a nice thing to do, probably they're not lying. They could simply tell you nothing, but they think you deserved to be told, so probably as said they're not lying, so keep on doing this, makes the world a better place with this mindset, brother"
soc_1170712,socialskills,reddit_comment,223,"Sad to see all the hate here. I think what this really boils down to is a lack of communication between both parties. Everyones quick to say that no one is entitled to any explanation or criticism which sure may be true, but what ever happened to human decency? What happened to treating others the same way you’d like to be treated? Would you enjoy constantly being treated as a second option? Would you enjoy someone giving you hope that feelings could change down the line when they know full well that they don’t plan on putting in the effort to try? In a time where infidelity, divorce, and the general breakdown of monogamous relationships is common, doesn’t that show that there is an overarching flaw in the way everyone communicates with one another and treats each other as disposable? It turns into a game where the person who cares the least wins which defeats the whole purpose of even attempting to develop a relationship with someone else. We’re quick to tell someone that they aren’t entitled to a relationship if they get ghosted or led on, but we’re never quick to address the lack of human decency in the act of ghosting or leading someone else on. Chances are, if the roles were reversed, they wouldn’t enjoy it happening to them either."
soc_349554,socialskills,reddit_comment,184,"&gt;  Sometimes letting people 'go' is fine, even if it means downright ignoring them.

Consciously ignoring people is not letting them go though, is it? It's spending time and energy gving that person a special treatment. 

You seem to have made your mind up firmly about this person and his behavior and how it impacts you and your wellbeing. The logical next step to me seems to be to put these thoughts into action in the most effective and least harmful way. Of course that is entirely up to you, you being the one experiencing the problem.

To come back to your question: yes, I have cut people off. But never ones I had to continue spending time with, because, well, the point of cutting off is that you don't.  I have also seen situations where people did not want anything to do with each other anymore and did what you did, specifically in a work environment. It turned toxic very quick and it's not something I would reccomend or want to experience again.

I hope you find a solution that works for you."

Is there a moral/ethical/religious reason you're not drinking? What's kept you clean all this time? Family history? Something in the past? Give some thought to it. Figure yourself out before making big changes.   
    
If you do decide to drink, start out small and with people you trust. Find your tolerance, how you behave when you're buzzed vs shit-faced, and always make sure you've got a safe way home.     
    
Just keep your safety in mind, man."
soc_182154,socialskills,reddit_comment,391,"OK, then. If I understand correctly, you'd like to tackle two areas:

1. Cold approaches, i.e. the initial approach with no valid reason other than to want to talk to a woman.

2. Reading body language and identifying signs of interest. That is, flirting.

I can share my personal convictions with you. They work for me, maybe they work for you too.

---
**Cold approaches:** Some people like cold approaches, others don't. And that goes both for the approacher as well as the approachee. However, you always have a valid reason to talk to someone: simply because you want to. Girls want to be approached. They want interesting people to talk to them. They just don't want to get the impression you're just approaching them with an ulterior motive in mind. They're people, after all. For you, this means you actually don't have to be afraid of anything. You don't come off as needy or creepy via text. 

Forget about pick-up lines or game. Be completely honest. Use whatever piqued your interest to strike up a conversation. If you don't have a clue what that might be, just go and introduce yourself. Wanting to talk someone *is* a valid reason to approach them. It's also not in the least creepy as long as you behave like a person. Further reading on approaches: [click here](http://www.nicknotas.com/dating-101/#approaching).

**Flirting signs**: The bad news: They vary from person to person and are usually ambiguous. The good news: that's what makes it fun.

Flirting doesn't have to be high-key all the time. There are times when low-key approaches and flirting are totally appropriate. There's such a thing as different flirting styles. You can find out which ones you prefer [here](http://flirtingstyles.dept.ku.edu/). 

You can, and should, learn to interpret body language. A good starting point is *The ultimate book on Body Language*, though please don't memorize signs. Having an increased awareness is more than enough. Also, don't beat yourself up about not recognizing signs. They're designed to be ambiguous and the way one guy/gal flirts is another person's usual behaviour. When in doubt, assume attraction - but always respect people's boundaries. A no is and stays a no, whether it's expressed verbally, through body language or in any other way.

The blog I mentioned isn't bad, [this one](http://markmanson.net/archive?cat=3) is interesting as well. Maybe one of them is for you.

The people at r/nofap treat it like some kind of superpower and go way overboard with what they think it can do. Just ends up being a big, weird circle jerk. Sure, anything can be a great placebo including holding in your fluids. Moderation works pretty well, too.

This is just my opinion, but having a girlfriend in school (can be) a huge wast of time and emotional energy. You have the rest of your life, enjoy your youth and start developing yourself in whatever direction you want to go instead of worrying about a girlfriend. More importantly, you need to find value in yourself for your own reasons instead of relying on those around you to tell you what you should value. The harder you try to get a girlfriend, the more desperate you will appear; desperation drives people away more than anything. It's tempting to feel like you need completion through being with someone else, but I cannot stress how important it is to be complete within yourself regardless of whether or not you have a partner. People can tell when you are desperately seeking fulfillment through others, and this is unattractive to a healthy individual. 

Being your own person, finding fulfillment in yourself, can make up for just about anything else you don't like about yourself. It can can take care of some of those things that can change, and allow you to not worry about the things you can't change.

Regardless of the reasons for your lack of confidence, you're going to have to step outside your comfort zone if you want to grow. Think about what you don't like about yourself. Can you fix it? If no, then forget about it and accept that aspect of yourself that makes you a unique individual. If yes, start figuring out what you can do to change and working in that direction. 

Some people get life on easy mode; good looks, money, charisma. And some of us get dealt a less appealing hand. But if you know how to look for it and keep yourself open, there is always a way forward. And even if you have nothing in the world going for you, there is always one thing you can do; you can be a good person to those around you. It may not seem to make much of a difference in school, but it can get you a long way in life and with others when it might have not been possible otherwise. But before you can genuinely be good to others you must learn to love yourself, which comes back to finding fulfillment in your own life regardless of the external world.

Think of confidence as not something to gain, but something already within you that you need to stop blocking. Instead of grasping, let go. Meditation can help with this. It's not a quick cure, but with practice it can help you get in touch with yourself, and help you understand where these feelings of doubt and anxiety really come from. Find a base deep within yourself from which to stand on, and when you have this your life will be structured around it. Love yourself, not in an egotistical way, but in a compassionate way. When you can do this everything else in life will fall into place."
soc_1663481,socialskills,reddit_comment,129,"Yeah I agree that undoubtedly deciding that they have a mental illness is a step too far. 

What's for sure though is there's definitely a mirror dimension going on with who has the trust problems. This ""friend"" has realised that they don't trust OP and needs to check his phone, so it's using that to say that OP should trust his friends to snoop on him. It's definitely a deranged perspective.

Exaggerating the violence is something that needs to be the point where the boundary is set. That's something no one needs in their lives just like gas lighting. Telling the friend that she's acting like someone with NPD is one approach. Just like you could tell someone they're acting like a psychopath. Phrasing is everything there, I agree"

I've considered giving Toastmasters a shot since it forces you to speak in front of people.

My theory is that it's a learning process, and I like to think there are many aspects to which we can improve ourselves - it just takes work and is not always easy. I'm still not great at thinking on my feet myself, but I've got  a much better 'wits score' than I used to.

soc_1354041,socialskills,reddit_comment,157,"You just sound annoying af.

Just because you read news doesn't mean you are smart lol

No wonder no one wants to hang out with you. You are the dude that makes everyone feel stupid for not doing things you are doing. Who wants to be around someone like that?

It's not about drinking, it's about you thinking you are better than people. Well maybe you are better than few, but not everyone.

I believe you filter what you say that is why you are quite. Making everything perfect when you talk and showing every mistake other people make. No one likes that.

I suggest getting humble and landing on the ground.

Best thing you could do is to try to get to know these people you don't value and think their are beneath you.

Learn to have fun and don't take yourself too seriously. 

Also someone mentioned being cynical is a safety mechanism and I agree."
soc_1240619,socialskills,reddit_comment,341,"Personally? I wouldn't consider that someone worth remaining friends with.

I'll cut someone over my feelings getting hurt. You can apologize, I might even accept it, but I may simply not be interested in hanging with you anymore. I get that. Ppl are allowed to do that to me too, even if its obvi not what I wish would happen n certainly hurts.

But petty spitefuls shit like goin out ur way to make plans in front of me and specifically not inviting me? Still lookin to use me as a resource/support when you're otherwise not actually up for rebuilding the relationship? In PARTICULAR betraying my trust and puttin my business I shared in private/confidence on blast to people?

No, sorry, fuck that. That's some shit I'd never do. If I'm not interested in bein friends with you anymore, that means I'm willin to pay the price of no longer having the benefits of advice/support of said friendship either. If I still want those things, then that means I'm interested in rebuilding the relationship, workin thru n squashing whatever drama we got, etc. But you can't have it both ways. I'm not gonna be cruel or mean to you beyond... yeah, no, I'm not gonna hang or chat no more... but I'm sure as hell not actually trying to hurt your feelings. I'm literally upset because you did that to me, probably not even wholly on purpose, what kinda hypocritical bullshit is it if I decide to now do it to you? And I don't tell no one's business to no one, even if I hate your gd guts, short of me thinking that info is important to someone's immediate safety.

And personally I'm not interested in having people in my life who don't share those particular values as far as having standards for your own behavior and affording others a certain level of respect that ain't conditional on your feelings or the situation or their behavior.

Matter of principles and core values or whatever for me.

Just my two cents."

In college, I was in a similar situation because everyone seemed to be in an established friendship group so most of my friendships were based off me helping people - they were friends I'd talk to in class but not really go out with. When I started uni, people were a lot less cliquey so I found it a lot easier to connect to others. It depends on you though and how you feel connected to other people"

You have to remember that these are people who wanted to hangout with you before and still do. This isn't because of your social skills or ""coolness"" but because of who you are as a person. You feel like you've been forgotten or passed by but that is your choice as much as anyone else's.

I know how hard it can be but talk to some of the people you used to get along most well with, connect with them just how you used to. You'll see soon enough that you still get along and have a good time.

soc_222519,socialskills,reddit_comment,317,"Sounds like a little narcissism.  That's not exactly a high enough IQ to warrant any, but then again, that's probably my narcissism speaking!  Believe it or not, people with narcissistic tendencies often have a pretty rocky self-concept and have to construct ways to inflate it.  Your self perception might be more of the issue than intelligence itself.  Social problems are stressful and sometimes painful.  Blaming yourself is even more painful, so a difference in intelligence is a great way to put the blame on other people.  Still, you may have to take responsibility for your contribution to the problem.  I take this post as a sign that you are ready to do that.

Many ""intelligent people"" (people with a high IQ, as defined by you) do not have interpersonal problems because there's more to it than that.  Watch a season of Survivor and you will see that many people with high IQ's will struggle to get ahead because they overlooked the value of emotional intelligence, which is the key to success in Survivor.  Life isn't much different.  We're stuck on earth with other people, and understanding ourselves and others is how we survive.  Remember, your definition of intelligence is related to the way you think, and the positive attributes you have.  A bubbly senser-feeler-type may find you to be unintelligent if you are stuck in your head all the time and don't have people skills.  Neither of you are wrong, but you use different definitions. 

On a side note, being in therapy is a great place to unpack all these problems.  Therapists know that narcissistic people can be very sensitive to criticism, and a good one will not put the blame on you, as it could cause you to drop them entirely.  However, if you decide for yourself that there's some room for improvement, they will support you and help you move forward.  It's up to you!"
soc_962678,socialskills,reddit_comment,127,"Tbh, I'd say just don't approach them 

Somewhere like a supermarket isn't a place where people want to make friends or find their SO and youll probably come off as weird for trying that

Its much better if you do that a college or school or club, anywhere where people are actually trying to meet others and all 

Also never use pick up lines, actually get to know the person, ask them about themselves and what they do or talk about something you already have in common with them.

The only time you wanna really use pick up lines is when the person already likes you and you just wanna make them laugh or blush

soc_1314832,socialskills,reddit_comment,192,"Just tell her you have a bit of social anxiety. I know it’s not the easiest to get that out because it makes you feel vulnerable, but you’d be surprised at how much more people open up to you and make themselves vulnerable if you take the lead in doing so. If someone actually makes fun of you for it, then you know that’s not a person you’d want in your life anyway. So it has the potential to both help you get closer with people so you can have more meaningful conversation and also acts as a filter that can help you weed out people that you really don’t want to chat with. 

If you’re worried about a person telling everyone else, look at it as an opportunity to find out who’s really friendly. There will be those in your office who will hear it and make more of an effort to accommodate and comfort, and there will be those who will have a more negative response. Hence it will further act as a filter for people you want to potentially interact with, and those you want to steer clear from."

Maybe it's worth asking to talk to the program instructor and say that you are getting bullied about your voice over and over and need help to deal with it (yes, even if the instructor is in on it because even if he/she doesn't recognise his/her role in it, maybe you'll get some help anyway). 

Dealing with the athletic team is harder because they often use teasing for interaction; however, maybe try an if-you-can't-beat-'em-join-'em approach and say things like, ""I try to be short so you have someone to look up to you"" or reply, ""I'll see what I can do about that"" or say ""yeah, I'm the same height as yesterday."" 

As to the cardigan comments, say, ""That joke is getting old.""

You have a lot of self-hatred and it's not very healthy. Women like mystery, not all but most. Use that to your advantage. Instead of laughing, slightly smile. everyone has a shitty time in school unless you're just perfect and those people suck. the good news is when you get out of school you don't have to deal with people as much and the world becomes easier. what I will say and truly believe myself is that you only live once and don't waste your time not living.

I like the saying ” A child has thousend language but growing up robbed them of the most of them. Don´t lose those language, embrace them.

soc_18048,socialskills,reddit_comment,548,"You say you're a nerd, well, what does that mean? You're a computer nerd, or maybe a sci-fi/fantasy nerd? Well, sports has nerds too, and, as you can imagine, they know as much about sports and are as passionate about it as you are with your thing. So to start, you need knowledge.

Sports are based on rules, and while the basic rules are straightforward, there are some exceptions and lesser known rules to be aware of as well. So learn the rules, that's got to be the easy part. The hard part is learning the players. A sports nerd can read the roster of their team (and often the rival team) from memory, and tell you where they went to school, what teams they've been on before, and tons other details that will make your head spin. (What useless crap do you know about computers? Same thing.)

Thing is, like not all computer users are nerds, not all sports fans are either. Some of them just like to watch the game, just like some computer users just like to check Facebook.

You can just stick to one sport. Find one that appeals to you most and learn about it. American football is probably the most exciting to watch. It's got action, and anything can happen. Baseball is the worst, same thing every time. Baseball fans, however, are some of the most dedicated. They really love the game, which I suppose you have to, when the sport is basically shit. Basketball, hockey, and international football (soccer) are in between, and attract different fans. So it really depends on what kinds of fans you want to interact with.

Keep in mind sports fans are clannish when it comes to teams. If you come across as favoring a rivalry team, like say the Boston Red Sox or the New York Yankees in baseball, you will be met with some degree of hostility by fans of the opposite team. That's just one rivalry (the only really big one I know about). You can defend your choice if it's your hometown (or closest to your hometown) team -- I root for the San Francisco teams (Giants baseball, 49ers football) because I'm from about an hour north of there. Oakland's quicker to drive to but we don't claim it (plus, when I was growing up, the Raiders were in L.A., so they were the Southern CA team, and even when they came back they kind of kept that stigma).

Also, faking an interest is a bad and stupid way to connect with people who share that interest. On the other hand, by feigning interest in a thing long enough, you might find yourself developing an interest.

If you have a smartphone, and it's running one of the last few Android versions (any Jelly Bean), use Google Now to search for your local team. Do it enough and Google Now will notify you of their scores, and when they play (Google will assume you're a fan). This helps you stay on top of scores, but there are dedicated apps for tracking scores, and they work on older versions of Android and the other phones. I used to use Google Scoreboard, I think it was called, just to have something to talk about at work."

Anyone can cry. Anyone can also feel sad.

There is a specific case, but it is really specical:

Sociopath, specifically those, who Don't feel guilt or remorse, cry for personal gain like sympathy.   


Cheating on partner is personal choice. You don't have to be sociapath or have a personality disorder to cheat and it is true the other way around. If you are one of those, it does not indicate that you will cheat on your partner.   


I would actually believe that such people do not cheat on their partners if they have such ilnesses, because their partner is one who accepts them and it is hard to find another.  


There could be a higher percentage of sociopath, who don't feel remore or guilt, who cheat, but otherwise there is no correlation between cheating and having one of those ilnesses"
soc_1486631,socialskills,reddit_comment,295,"Here's a true thing you need to accept: once you are BORN ONTO THIS PLANET, you are here to make your mark. And you will be doing so the entire time you're alive. Breathing oxygen! Taking up space! Using resources! Coming into people's attention span! Some family had to raise you! Teachers had to teach you! Etc.

And the same is true of everyone else. So now you have to decide what kind of IMPACT you're going to make. (We ALL make an impact. It can be positive, negative, interesting, boring, whatever. But we all bring something to the table.) 

In your shoes I'd start by seeing what you can do to make the world a better place because YOU are in it. So I'd start to reach out to people who need help. Say hello and give a compliment to someone who is quiet. Offer to help a neighbor with something. Take time to listen to what's going on with a family member and be really interested in it. Befriend someone who is lonely. Join a volunteer group. Make an effort to do a ""Pay It Forward"" exercise each day.

Once you realize the world is a better place with YOU in it, you'll stop worrying about taking up people's attention in a negative way! Also as far as your persona, do some daily gratitude meditation so you have joy and peace in your heart. Then start COMMUNICATING those good vibes to the world!

People can FEEL the emotion radiating from you. So work on having a great positive mindset and some passion for: yourself, other people and LIFE ITSELF. Enthusiasm is contagious, so start developing that. THAT is the type of person I want to be around and hang out with.

soc_924440,socialskills,reddit_comment,412,"A lot of it depends on who you are talking to. Each person will bring up new ideas and questions. I think the best advice is to attempt to cultivate a genuine curiosity about other people.

With a teacher asking them about how they got into a subject or if they are a college proffessor reading a bit about their research can open a lot of avenues of conversation.

Classmates can be difficult because you may not always want to be friends with that person, assuming you do try to pay attention to them (in a not obsessive or creepy way), maybe they are doodling something, maybe they are reading a book, or more generally, what are their goals and plans for the future?

People like talking about themselves the more you can become genuinely curious and interested about their life the more you will have to talk about. 

Once you start a nice dialogue you can start trying to relate to people with stories of your own that you think are similar about yourself (this should be used with caution, conversations shouldn’t feel like they’re being initiated simply for you to tell a story about yourself, they’re more to highlight an aspect of the other’s story that you found interesting).

As for being funny, that one is tough, but generally humans find unexpected things funny. Most comedians talk about common and well known topics, but the punch line is something unexpected, we’ve all thought about that topic 100 times, but they thought of it in that one way that was different and unexpected. This is one reason why Dad Jokes remain a popular form of entertainment, puns are an example of this idea (even though they get overused and can become expected). Cynicism is another often used comedic tool, taking such a caricatured dark perspective on a topic as to shock others, taking this too far often results in a feeling of, “too far,” or “too soon,” too cynical can definitely make you appear too callous.

There are many more tools than this, which you can study more formally, but there is no substitute for just talking to people. There are books like “How to Win Friends and Influence People.” I’m sure you can also find books about small talk and incorporating comedy. Some times copying a dialogue or joke is good practice, you might memorize a few jokes you like and try to incorporate them into your conversations that week."

I know how you feel, it really sucks when you're an easygoing person and people get on your case for the kind of stupid things you've just let them get away with. People will never stop calling you out for things but you can always just turn it back around on them. I *hate* doing it, but I've gone down the road of never saying anything back and it pretty much always leaves people with this impression that they do no wrong.

Skip the suggestion that it might be creepy, make sure it's definitely the kind of thing *you'd say*. Don't overthink this, but there's no point sending a message if it's not *you* talking. Clearly you want to get to know this person better.

Also, make sure you're comfortable with the topic. What if they don't really care about music? Is that okay with you? Is talking about music a good way to get to know a person? This isn't really too important, but it's worth thinking about. Maybe try considering what you wouldn't mind talking about if a stranger hypothetically started talking to you.

And finally address whether you care about being a massive creep or not. I've inadvertently been just a tad creepy at least once, and it sucked, but I rarely feel regret. I advise being sure of your decision, make sure you justify it to yourself so that you don't regret it later. If you know you had good reasons, then there's not much to regret.

soc_192476,socialskills,reddit_comment,259,"Tons of incredibly shit advice in the responses here. You don't need to play games, manipulate, etc. You're simply discovering why so many women refuse to make the first move. It's the same problem that the majority of guys have. As a guy, I've found that there are quite a few women who will respond to my show of interest simply because they have nothing better to do at the time. They're not interested with me in the moment, but they don't have anything else planned, so why not meet up for coffee and see if there's possibly some chemistry? As a guy, this means lots of dealing with rejection. It's normal. It's how things go. I don't let it stop me from continuing to ask women out. 

My only advice is to keep doing what you're doing. Be who you are. Sure, spend some time with solid introspection, only you can figure out if you are doing something wrong. Keep at it and eventually you'll find someone who likes you for who you are. If you have to manipulate a person to get into a relationship, it will end. 

Again, most women do not make the first move. It is scary, there's rejection, there's pain. However, I believe this can make a person better. Guys are going to show initial interest because it is incredibly flattering, and often a breath of fresh air to be the one getting approached. However, if there's no chemistry, they'll find something else to do with their time. Just as any woman does. "

But i do have some friends ( i dont hangouy with them every day talk everyday or sometimes even weekly. We talk when it happens (with the flow i guess) and no one takes it personal. I am very close to my younger brother (4 years younger) 
we hangout alot . Its a really good brother relationship. I also go to my moms house and am around her husband , and 4 other adults and guy that live with them. They are all good people and good to be around.
I completely lost the social conditioning of keeping track what day it is - meaning 
oh today is monday what a drag or yahh its friday time for the weekend.
I quit my 9-5 and started freelancing animation work. Its been going really well and i absolutely love it. I also do food delivery as a side gig in los angeles
and have tons of social interactions with people..
This has helped me stay social.
Every now and then i hangout with someone but havent made close friends , yet. 
Overall i'm actually the happiest ive ever been in my life. I love people , even soemtimes strangers unconditionally , i guess i just like doing my own thing. 
Spending so much time with myself , i have really learned a lot about myself and have took time to do lots of deep inner work that has helped me 
keep an open mind , a clear mind and also lead with empathy. 
I ride bike sometimes alone or with my brother.
Go try different food spots with my brother , sometimes with a friend.
Don't get me wrong sometimes i want to go party , meet girls ( i still do this regardless) and do this or that but thats rare . i really do enjoy not doing that sometimes. 
I don't really care what people think about me , i dont crave validation nor do i need it from an external source. I feel like i have validated myself already.I dont need attention from people. Although one day soon i do want to have a girlfriend.

If he says no, that does NOT mean he does not want to be your friend. He can be just busy. If he flakes three times however, it would be his time to put in effort. That's how i would handle it. But it is just my opinion, i am no expert in this at all."

As a response to your inquiry: It depends on what you're trying to say, like sharing a story (longer response) or an opinion (starts off short, elongate as you go). Also, watch the other person's facial expressions. Usually there's a shift between the active/paying attention eyes and bored/get over with it stare.

during that time, i was going through a lot. i was harming myself, doing drugs, getting drunk and trying to off myself. i came from an abusive family and had nowhere to go to be safe other than work. 

he understood this, because he went through the same thing at my age and was just then starting recovery for himself. we were an inspiration to each other. 

he became like the other brother i always needed in life; i had a place to go when i couldn’t be at home, he helped me work on myself and see my value, get clean and stop cutting. he regularly got me food and clothing when i needed it and we still hung out like friends too. 

without him, i would not be here today. i owe my life to him for saving me and to this day i still consider him my best friend, even though he moved across the state and i don’t see him too much anymore. but he prepared me for life. i wouldn’t be able to do this without him. 

age gaps are not inherently predatory. if you vibe with someone other than you, big deal! who cares! they make you happy and they are a healthy friend, if anyone has anything to say about that they can fuck off.

soc_362615,socialskills,reddit_comment,289,"A good example for your problem is: When you try to attract women, think of what would you do if there were no women, and do that.

Make jokes that YOU like and don’t care what others think bro. Right now, you are trying to mold yourself into an ACCEPTABLE version for other people. That makes you the most BORING person ever. Just be YOU.
      Thing is, I can kinda tell that you are trying to make friends to be happy. You can simply decide to be happy. Happiness comes from inside yourself, once you accept yourself for who you are. Once you do that and are perfectly satisfied with being alone with yourself, people will come to you. But you won’t care anymore, because you finally discovered yourself. 
     When you place your happiness and your self image on outside factors like friends and others opinion, if they have good opinion, then you’re happy. But if that changes, then you become sad. Your happiness is not in your hands. It fluctuates depending on others. The only person you need to please is yourself. But if it comes from inside you, than it is stable.

The best thing I learned is this: The way people interact with you is a PROJECTION of how they feel about themselves. It does not REFLECT who YOU are. Only YOU can decide that. Read this everyday and after a month, if 10 people say they hate you in the same day, you will still be happy if your opinion of yourself is solid. "
soc_413613,socialskills,reddit_comment,136,"Well, you saw her on Monday, and she says she wants to hang out with you again.  


I'd say use this opportunity to try to arrange another date. This one at a place where you can chat (not like a movie theater this time). Maybe a walk + restaurant (or even just an ice cream cone). I really think asking her if something is wrong will turn out smoother in person.  


If it's really tearing you apart and you need to know tonight, then I suggest using wording something along the lines of. ""Are you not sending me pictures of your face because I did something wrong? I'm sorry. I can't figure out what I did.""  


But if it turns out it was nothing, an unneeded apology might hurt more than it helps.

Youll think how will i socialize? Getting drunk is the best way to socialize. I dont think you should act differant because your friends or “going to be friends” think you are weird. Fuck them. Being controlled by this invisible hand is wrong. The control is yours. How many fucks you give is your choice too. You dont need a changed personality just to socialize. Someone will like you or they will not. Fuck those who dont and fuck who do either. Make your own workd my brotha

I ran a business myself and it can be very stressful. But really there's not much you can do aside from being honest with him and voicing your concerns. 

For yourself though, don't hesitate to ask for professional help, most people can benefit from it even if you don't have massive problems. There's absolutely no shame in it. Learning how to manage your emotions is really important. Speaking from personal experience, your mental health isn't something you should ignore."

I do very well with intellectual talks 1-on-1 but it's rare finding those kind of people, especially with our political climate in the US. I also do well with party type people because I get an immense high doing crazy things and love talking about my crazy party days. 

What I'm bad at is talking about myself. I just haven't lived a good life in my 24 years living on this planet so I'd rather talk about other things and avoid my sappy life.

My advice is to create a brand of yourself and work on it. It's what I'm currently doing. What makes you different from everybody else? "
soc_214350,socialskills,reddit_comment,184,"&gt; How do I relate with others? Through reading, exercise, hobbies? How should I be interesting and easily hold chemistry with people?

IMO, do you first.  You have to decide what you want to do with yourself, who do you want to be, what you enjoy doing.

Do those things, be comfortable and happy with an identity of yourself exposed through your actions, interests, and choices.

Then you are interesting to people because you are doing things that they aren't, you can talk about those things, you can talk about the things others do that you don't, and why.

The trick here is to actual give a shit about people.  Which is hard because to start with you have to not give a shit.  You become who you want to be on your terms by not caring about what others think.

But when you want to then relate to people, you need to actually care again.

Also, you need to not be condescending.  Which is a challenge I face, ~~because I am literally the best person in the world~~ because I'm an ok guy"
soc_435643,socialskills,reddit_comment,593,"Mistakes. Everyone makes them. And we mean EVERYONE. The only difference is that most people learn from them. You admit that you do not learn from the mistakes you make. Are these little mistakes, or big bloopers? Are your mistakes hurting the person that you supposedly love? From your post, it appears your mistakes are causing some damage. And that is dangerous. When you decide to do something that will be a mistake, do you stop to think of the possible consequences to yourself? Do you stop and think how your actions (behaviors) have the potential to affect others? This is where you go off the rail because of your poor choices. 
Now, we want you to think about the last mistake that you made. Think of what it was and then think about how it made you appear to others around you. Now, think about how the mistake you made affected the people that are the closest to you. Write these things down so that you can look at it all when you are finished. Now don't beat yourself up over it, but THINK about it as we laid it out. Take some time and do it now. 
Looking back over the example, how did your decision to go ahead with the mistake make you appear to others? Also, how many people did your poor choice affect in some way? And, how did it affect the people that are closest to you? How does that make you feel knowing this? Now, again looking back, try to think of the moment that you decided to do that one thing that was a mistake. What if you had taken a minute, a moment, a millisecond to CONSIDER  your choice and how that choice would have affected people close to you and also how you would appear to others as you stepped through that poor choice? 
What is important here is that we must take the time to consider HOW our mistakes affect our friends, our family, and ourselves. Sometimes people do not take the time to consider situations properly. This is where the problems come into play. We must place ourselves in a position to be able to consider the consequences of our behaviors and choices and be able to step away quickly in order to protect ourselves from harm. And protect the people we love and care about from emotional stress and embarassment. It's not as hard as you may think. The secret is to be able to recognize danger early and act quickly to get away from that danger. Perhaps you are not taking the time to recognize potential danger. That is something you must begin to do everyday. Be on watch for danger. 
How can you do that? Easy. Dump the toxic people from your life - which you have already chosen #1 over #2 - and THINK  about each choice that you make and act accordingly, which means CONSIDER how your choices will affect your friends, your family and yourself. 
We know this is a lot to take in, but life is hard. And life tortures us enough, so why must we do it to each other and ourselves? 
And hang in there, because you are going to do well. You already know there is a problem and that is the first and most difficult step to take. You are already a winner. Hey, deep down inside you is greatness just waiting to get out. Give yourself permission to do just that. We have faith in you.

soc_271162,socialskills,reddit_comment,237,"What's your issue? That you don't have friends to hang out with IRL despite being able to talk to people, or that people you friend on SM don't message you?

Some people message, some people don't. As a general rule, people only message other people on SM when they have something specific to say. If you don't have any friends you'd call up on the phone to say ""Hey, how's it going?"", then they wouldn't message you for that, either. If YOU want to have SM message conversations, it's up to YOU to start them. If you want to cultivate friendships where you check in with each other's lives, it's up to you to cultivate them.

About 75% - 90% of my SM messages are initiated by me; and most of those are where I send somebody something funny that I think they'll enjoy.

I grew up with a group of friends who almost never called me to invite me to stuff - if I wanted to do stuff together, I had to call and invite everyone else. So you know what I did? I became the guy who organized most of our group activities. The only person's behavior you can control is your own. And part of that is reminding yourself again and again that just because THEY don't initiate doesn't by default mean that they don't like you and don't want to hang with you. "

Not saying that is a bad thing or even that it is your choice, but what I've come to realize is if your more conventionally handsome or attractive, people are way more willing to include you in thier social groups and openly make friends with you. 

If you had to rate yourself on a conventional scale of attractiveness 1-10, where would you honestly put yourself? That might be more telling. Because at the end of the day, people are still very shallow and judgemental on appearances even if they are only subconsciously being affected by this."
soc_73607,socialskills,reddit_comment,201,"Ah, but sprezzatura was instrumental to a courtier's professional career in support of his liege, and the same applies to business environments!

Sprezzatura also means hiding the ugly work. It doesn't mean being lazy or careless, but the illusion of doing so. Those 15 hours you spent perfecting that agreement? You say that it took 2 nights and a bottle of Captain Morgan. That money you spent to make a wise home improvement? ""Ehhh, it's only a couple hundred Chipotle burritos."" Both statements are true when you do the math, but the presentation makes them look like not big deal. That's part of the magic.

Rest assured, both sprezzatura AND anti-sprezzatura are valid paths to being a good leader. In fact, I'd say that there's no optimal build for a good leader. A good leader inspires his followers to excellence, or else he's just a super-employee. Whether he takes a taskmaster or paternal approach depends on the make up of his subordinates. A good leader is only one man; it is his people that give him that title.

soc_242347,socialskills,reddit_comment,165,"Do you mean ""going out"" like going to bars and parties on the evenings and week-ends, or ""going out"" like stepping out of the house?

If it's the first, I don't think you should worry too much - that can simply be a personal preference, and it's your right to just not be into that.

If it's the second one, it's a bit more worrying, but it looks like you are doing something about it already: you're going to school and to the gym, so you are meeting people, and talking.

Instead of waiting for your friend to invite you and having to go over there, could you invite them instead? You'll remove a bit of the difficulty you have getting out of the house, but still make sure to socialise a bit.

Another thing to try so you socialize a bit could be, on one of the three days you go to the gym to join a group class of some kind.

In my experience this is one of the easiest and most powerful ways to improve your social life. I make it clear to my friends that I always say yes to invites. What happens is, people see me as a person they can rely on. Even if everyone else flakes, they know I won't. When you say no to someone, they will be far less likely to invite you a second time.

Even if what you get invited to doesn't sound like a good time, still say yes. Think of it like this: if presented with a choice, choose the option that is more likely to result in a cool story. Discomfort and disinterest should not factor into your decision. Some of my most fun nights are from going out and doing things I wasn't into to begin with, but ended up enjoying myself."

soc_1361204,socialskills,reddit_comment,236,"Phone calls are more interactive and more information can be processed faster because of that. If someone answers a text and it wasn’t what you were looking for then you may start to realize how hard it is to get an answer this way. I find typing tedious after spending my work day on the computer. But everyone is different and I find it helps to understand preferences. When email first became generally available I found that I could finally communicate with people who didn’t do as well in conversation. But email was still mail so you had to wait for delivery and response. Texting is closer to conversation. It  helps people who are socially awkward or have social anxiety in some instances and this is good. I still find that conversation allows you to cut through to the point faster in more involved or complex conversations. 

It is interesting to me how I feel like a benefit of texting is that the person can respond when it is convenient- the one downside of phone calls because they demand that you engage immediately. You can think before responding to a text without the sense of an awkward silence. Other people though sometimes apologize because it has taken them 3 or 4 hours to respond. This indicates to me that they expect me to treat it as a phone call - so many new rules for engagement!"

Your issue sounds like you are having problems with scheduling and people failing to commit to plans you're trying to make with them, I think you probably are making plans that are too immediate, plan things a week in advance rather than 1 day. People have busy and chaotic lives and when you make plans with them they might genuinely want to do something with you but they realize that they have an appointment that day.

Lastly, the problem of being ghosted and having people drift from you is probably influenced by the way you've chosen to react to and perceive their actions. You need to be able to empathize with the fact that there is probably a reason they weren't able to hang out and you've probably encountered the same situation they were in during your life. So try to be compassionate and understanding that they were unable to hang out, by doing so you will make them want to make it up to you rather than feeling like you're criticizing them for having their own lives.

Make that extra effort to engage them, if that means learning their names, greeting them with a high-five or handshake, and ask them about their days (a lot of times you'll get some WILD answers, so prepare yourself LOL), and ask follow up questions! Maintain eye contact and smile at them, and even if they go off on crazy tangents, you just need to make them feel heard and seen! (For me, a lot of my kids wanted to talk endlessly about Fortnite LOL).

Or, you can tell people that you are quiet because you're not in the mood for bantering and keep to that.  Or, (I recommend this if you want to improve your skills in standing up for yourself) respond to the genuinely funny jokes, but whenever 'jokes' happen instead, shut them down.  Some sample things to say (preferably while looking the person straight in the eye, in a calm tone of voice.  Practice ahead of time.)

""Don't belittle me.""

""I do not appreciate being spoken to like that.""

""You're crossing a line.""

""Explain to me how that's funny."" 

You will hear back things like ""it was just a joke"" and ""chill out,"" but keep doing this.  If your work permits, walk away from the group.  You might even find that some others have been feeling uncomfortable, but afraid of speaking up.  Once you speak up, they will join in on your side.  Social disapproval is a powerful force.

soc_1291999,socialskills,reddit_comment,885,"I have no idea why would you bring the ""sorta..."" thing, but I understand your shame, which is not uncommon thing after those experiences...

My question is a bit practical, but also clarifying. Do you want to learn to dance and enjoy it as some other people do? Or do you want to learn how to feel better about yourself and clear out the insecurities you carry in your mind often times during social events? You may pick both actually. If dancing is something you really would love to be good at.

Let's start with You. Why do you believe you feel that way? And why do you believe it's not a good thing to happen to you - to have such feelings? In my understanding those feelings are perfectly fine for a person with undeveloped emotional body. Whether you'll carry them through your life or let yourself understand and accept them is really up to you. Having feelings is normal. Having feelings you decided to label bad is normal as well. Being suicidal because of that is not uncommon but it's in most people's understanding not healthy. Back to the basics. What world do you believe you are living in? Is it a hostile place, or is it a friendly place? That's a core believe, but it also reflects how you treat yourself. Do you love and appreciate yourself or do you treat yourself badly? And if you treat yourself well, probably you would not imagine yourself to be living into a hostile world. You will pick the friendly world. Are you ready to understand that you are making this choice all the time? By deciding what other people's behavior mean to you. But not only that. You have the Creator's power within you, and from that core understanding and belief, you paint on top of reality your version of it and experience it the way you believe it to be in your core. You can at any given tume change your core beliefs and the relationship you have with yourself. You can also be aware how that fulfillment changes your capacity to recognize certain things in other people's behavior. Your interpretations and reactions change, based on your way of perceiving.

Dude, it's normal to be awkward. Period. Love and appreciate this awkwardness (yourself really)! Check how Elvis Pressly was dancing back in the days. That was one of the most awkward thing people have seen at that time, and considered as a way of dancing. You can always go and visit some dancing lessons and even meet some great people and friends there. People you've never knew existed before. You have the capacity to connect with and relate to those people. You may even become passionate about dancing. It all starts with how you treat yourself, how you think about yourself, how you feel about yourself, and do you enjoy your own company! Next step based upon that clarification and if you decide to treat yourself better by your own love and appreciation towards yourself, you will really choose to believe that you are living in a good and friendly world. Because you can be good and friendly, actually everyone can if they choose to. And many choose to, after they meet another human being that has already chosen for himself/herself. Because it feels good. It feels good to be. It feels good to exist. It feels good to be yourself. And even when bad things happen and unpleasant feelings arise it's all right. That's also a way of being good to yourself - to let yourself experience those feelings and to appreciate yourself - the one capable to experience such feelings. No need for the blame game, no need for the shame game. They may happen on the surface as some form of joyful entertainment, but the core is different and everyone understands it is a joke and some of your friends may decide to perticipate in such a game for the joy of it. It becomes superficial. It always has been. You were not in the know of it. It's normal. Most people go through this one way or another. Some keep themselves away from themselves for their entire life. But even they at the end of their lives usually realize it for what it really was and let it go/get free from what they misbelieved to be true. Don't wait for the end. Do it now. And don't rush to end the life you are. It may end in its due time, it may not (most people don't know about this possibility). Live it fully and happily and joyfully and lovingly as much as you get capable of and then even some more. In a way you deserve it. In a way you owe it to yourself. In a way it's your inheritance. And I won't wish you happiness, I'd allow myself to feel happy for you right now. Because I choose to and it's my selfless way to be selfish. 😄

""Learn to take a punch (and keep going)"" is one of the fundamentals, and the only way to do that is to get punched, repeatedly.  Yeah, it sucks, but no matter how good you are at dodging or avoidance, sometimes it's unavoidable.  A boxer who gets KO'ed after one punch isn't a good boxer.  Have you done any strenuous exercise, like long-distance running or weight-lifting?  I can tell you that that shit hurts and is strenuous; sometimes you *do* just have to tough your way through it. Learn from the experience, and using that wisdom, lessen the aches.  With experience, you *do* get better at handling missteps.  

Not everything that hurts you should be viewed as an antagonistic combat sport, because most people aren't out to actively hurt you (and those who are should *absolutely* be avoided).  

Asking someone out and getting rejected *is* practice for future encounters.  We all suffer in life, and it's your choice to either learn from it or not.  Hiding in the basement is still a form of suffering, you know."

My battle is alas only my own. I cannot say what works for me will work for anyone else. 

Here's my two cents though and sorry for the rant, you can completely ignore me if you want.

I think I've seen the advice to unfriend anyone who is toxic and detrimental though. I think only keeping people I really like around helped. I find social media a lot like keeping a bonsai tree. It is nicest to shape it to be what you want it to be.

When I'm depressed, I don't know know what shape I wanted my social life to be. I just wanted to not be lonely! I think that's the key to it all. And this allowed me to befriend shitty people and it just reenforces the negativity in my life. This is why social media might be bad. I see people complaining how everyone is shallow in social media and I find that kind of sad. People are people. Social media allows people to see only a surface of people lives. There's naturally no depth to it. You see a couple post pictures of their anniversary. Well obviously they're not that glamorous or lovey dovey 24/7. You see someone's video of their dog being sweet. You don't see the countless moments of frustration it took to train that dog. You see someone you care about suddenly make you think twice about her because she reveals she's against vaccines. But instead of trying to remember who she is as a person, many, myself included, are more ready to jump to criticize what a Karen this person is! If this was real life, and she told me this, we'd have a conversation about it, agree to disagree and move on. On social media, it lingers and becomes proof of something or another.

People need to connect to see something ""deeper"". It's in our actions and our conversations. It's not the platform, but what we make of it. I've done a lot of unfollowing and a lot of reaching out to get to where I am which is still not where I want to be. And I try to do it little by little on the good days. On my bad, depressed day, nothing's getting done and I'm not helping myself by stressing about it. So I wait till the fogs clear and start taking care of my social bonsai tree."

Compliments in the beginning are usually appreciated, as long as you really believe what you're saying. Try not to go overboard though, you'll seem desperate and the girl will get uncomfortable. Also, try to compliment her on something she has active control over (like her hair style or cool jewelry) rather than something like her eyes; doing so will be more likely to lead to a real conversation (""oh I wanted to look like this actress from my favorite show ___. Have you seen it?"" / ""I got this bracelet on my trip to ___  last summer"")  and not just a smile or thanks. 

If you start making plans to hangout, be flexible and willing to compromise (what to do, where to eat) but for the love of God don't be afraid to make a decision if the girl is indecisive... Whatever you choose will be better than not making a choice (and thus not hanging out) so don't be worried about your choice not being good enough. 

Also, if you're really interested in the girl and have mutually decided to hangout sometime, don't leave it at ""sometime."" Many people are terrible at actually following through with vague plans, even if they fully intend to and believe they'd enjoy doing so; ultimately, if both people leave it up to the other, it's never going to happen. For people with social anxiety or girls who subscribe to traditional dating rules (waiting for the guy to take action), your failure to reach out to them will likely be perceived as rejection and will make them even less likely to initiate in the future (when you see them next and try to hangout ""sometime,"" they might think you're just saying this to politely end the conversation / being fake). So be specific! (""would you be interested in going rock climbing sometime? ... Awesome, are you free next Friday?""). 

Unfortunately, some people aren't comfortable with flat out rejecting others, so they resort to having excuses for every day you suggest. Try to look out for this and obviously let it go if they're not interested; if you're unsure and think they may be legitimately busy but interested, make it clear that your offer is good for a later date but that they need to contact you when they're less busy if they want to make it happen. 


TLDR; building relationships (friendships or dating) are often unnecessarily complicated by inadequate communication and social anxiety... This question is bringing back so many awkward memories for me and makes me want to write you a novel. So many flashbacks right now. Hopefully you'll find some of it helpful - remember: genuine compliments, humor, taking initiative. Good luck!

soc_735055,socialskills,reddit_comment,142,"It's important to have a good start. And by start I mean mindset, even before having the chance to start a conversation.

Your mindset, your choice but I would be careful to not put myself in the position of having to prove anything to anyone. A friendship is a co-creation process where you fail a couple times. You can see it as a natural selection.

You bring value on the table. It's clear for me by the type of the questions you ask yourself. Only a self-conscious person would ask themselves that.

I've struggled multiple times to integrate and make friends, it took me years to understand that it takes time and patience to find the right people. But you must persist on finding them in a detached way, just put yourself in social contexts and let things flow their natural way."
soc_1267304,socialskills,reddit_comment,124,"I mean hey, honestly just clearing the air in a good way could work if you want him to like you. Just take full responsibility and do it at a reasonable time I would say. “Hey man, I just wanted to apologize for the other night. I know you have a family and you’re all just trying to sleep, that must’ve been very frustrating for you. I wasn’t thinking. I’d like to get off on a better foot”. It’s up to you, but this is what I would do. Just try not to interrupt dinner or anything. Also you might want to catch him while he’s outside as to not have to knock and potentially wake the baby, unless the baby is clearly awake."
soc_1298559,socialskills,reddit_comment,178,"I would be careful with this. 

It sounds like you need alcohol to socialize. If you are always relying on alcohol to socialize, it may become a problem. You might want to fix the root of the problem instead of relying on old liquid courage.

Sounds like you have social anxiety, and perhaps some confidence or even self esteem issues when it comes to socializing. The needing to be perfect seems like a defense mechanism more then anything. I get just being able to relax is helpful. However I do believe that being able to relax and socialize without relying on alcohol is more character building, healthier, and  more satisfying.

There are medications that can help with anxiety and social anxiety (effexor is one)

However this is up to you. Alcohol has a way of impairing one's judgment and is habit forming. I personally do not think it is the way to go. I am not saying to never drink to have some fun. I am just saying they don't call it liquid courage for nothing,

Good luck."
soc_298475,socialskills,reddit_comment,397,"I can't say I've had much more luck than you where it comes to socializing, but I think that's because I'm largely indifferent to most social activities, not simply because I'm anxious. Even so, here's a few things that have worked for me when I want to connect with people:

* Asking people about themselves can be good, but even just complimenting them goes a long way. (Maybe this is easier for women though.) People are usually very flattered to hear anything nice about themselves, and something as simple as ""Neat shoes! where'd you get them?"" can be enough to get them to open up to you.

* I was (still am) the calm, quiet one in a group. When I started opening up about my thoughts I became the *weird* quiet one, the one always making offbeat jokes and strange observations about the stuff going on around us.  More often than not I'd just say odd things to myself, aloud, and see if I could get a laugh. Some people find this off-putting, but I've met a number who find me pretty funny. 

* If I find something a person's interested in (say, cooking), I'm a pretty well-read person, so I try to offer something I've read about the topic. ""You like wasabi but not black pepper? Interesting! Did you know that the spiciness in wasabi inhibits microbial growth?"" etc etc. Some people look at me strangely, but some are quite willing to hear about the stuff they like. I know quite a bit about drugs and herbs (legal and illegal) and find that it's pretty easy to find people interested in learning more about these topics.

* Most of my introvert hobbies people can't relate to, though there's always one or two who are into video games and popular films, if either are your thing. TBH it's much easier for me to socialize when there's a central focus for the group: the arcade, or a movie, or even a walk. Then you can shift attention to the film whenever conversation gets difficult.

My wife is introverted too, and we always leave parties/social gatherings early, since we tend to find them tiring if they go on for too long. Don't feel bad that you don't get the same energy from large social gatherings as extroverts do. You can still socialize in moderation and be perfectly fine. "
soc_1233469,socialskills,reddit_comment,107,"Honestly clubs may just not be your type of place and that's 100% fine because everyone is different. Plenty of my friends don't enjoy clubs and rather be at home or they like a more relaxed bar instead. 

But it also sounds to me that you are not really letting loose while in the club and really experiencing how others typically have fun. You don't even have to be a good dancer, just do whatever your body feels like. You can even just be jumping up and down and still have fun. It helps if you are with friends while in the club who are pretty extroverted"
soc_1136758,socialskills,reddit_comment,706,"I think the standart advice that most people don't want to hear is still worth a try. Daily cold shower, no fap, regular work out and taking good care of yourself in general. You can read about why no fap and cold showers is supposed to improve your self esteem and reduce your anxiety but even if it doesn't work, it's worth a try.

Obviously this won't make you meet people so for that you have to join a club or a class or anything where you meet people. Like a cooking class or a teenis club or whatever. Something that you're interested in. I've read about someone on r/ForeverAlone who was like 32 y/o kissless virgin who joined a teenis club and then met the love of his life who he married shortly after.

Once you surround yourself with people especially through a hobby or a similar interest, finding friends comes pretty naturally I think. One advice that might be helpful is that it's not that necessary to be interesting, but all you have to do is being interested. Ask them questions and listen. Helps for both finding friends and finding a girlfriend.

Maybe you have bad luck and only meet men though, but that's not a problem. Maybe these guys know girls or they have girlfriends that know other girls. Through these connections you can always befriend women even if you only make friends with men at first. Important is that you rarely say no and never let your anxiety speak for you. If they invite you to a party or want you to meet their female friend, don't say no because you're afraid or cancel it at the last moment because you have a bad feeling about it.

So, once you're friends with both men and women, you want to get a girlfriend. Now before you make your move and ask out the girl of your choice, make sure she likes you first. If you think a certain girl is really attractive or you simply like her personality, try talking to her more often and maybe even flirt with her a little and see how she reacts to it. If she doesn't like it or she doesn't like you, that's fine, then don't ask her out and avoid the inevitable rejection. Maybe she still rejects you even if you thought she likes you, you have to accept that. Be dissapointed but don't get angry at her.

Now that you have your first date, don't overforce anything, relax, and remember that it's supposed to be fun. No matter what happens in your journey or what you do, it's all a learning experience. Maybe you have a few awkward moments, but it's much better than having no moments at all.

You said you worry that a women becomes uninterested in you because you have no experience, but do you walk up to her and say ""hey im xyz and I've never kissed a women before"". No. This topic usually only comes up way into the relationship. Sure you should probably tell her that you're still a virgin before you have sex, but if you already know her for a while it's most likely not a big deal.

The path that I described is pretty secure, but what might be faster is online dating. However the topic of past relationships might come up alot quicker and might also be much more of a dealbreaker here and with no experience I can imagine your chances are a lot worse this way. Might be worth a try to collect experience tho.

Lastly, it really doesn't matter how old you are. Never be ashamed of yourself. If the question of past relationships ever comes up, be honest and confident, maybe you can even joke about it. As an example: My parents divorced in their forties and my dad had 4 relationships since then and my mom had 2, so age is really not a problem to find new love. While experience makes it easier of course, you need to collect it first. So regardless of what you do, atleast do something. It's always better than doing nothing in any case.

Hope this helps and gives you a little motivation."
soc_490508,socialskills,reddit_comment,219,"But he didn’t say shower more. He said “take a shower” implying that if you haven’t been taking showers, take one.

It really depends on how you look at the world. There’s always more you can do to get what you want, even if it’s harder. It’s reasonable and rational to say that there are people who do all these things and still fail to justify why you won’t try more. But you could also point to all the people who improved after doing those things and say that’s why you should try more. Both are rational points and I used to be in the first camp. But I won’t act like that mind set was making me happy. You choose what you want to believe and look at the evidence that proves that, not the other way around. I chose different because I wanted to be happy for once. It took some risk, and some painful rejections but no amount of advice would help you if you actually don’t want it. It’s okay to not be willing to change right now. But at least have a mindset that allows you to be happy. And if you’re goal is “how do I feel happy, you take the steps that genuinely get you the things you want to be happy."

I am have a lot of good qualities, but there’s more to me than what people like. And i’ve had to learn to set some pretty firm boundaries. I have turned into a chronic unfriender because I know what keeps my sanity in tact. I am a super friendly person, but I’m not trying to make as many friends as possible. I only keep healthy friendships. They way I see it, what’s the point of having friends if you can’t be yourself around them?"
soc_1235904,socialskills,reddit_comment,336,"I’m sorry, dude, but it’s not MY worldview I’m speaking from— it’s neurotypicals’. You’re just not in a position where you can be determining the intent of their behavior, simply because you aren’t them. Any “assumptions” i made about you that weren’t explicitly supported by what you’ve already said, I did actually preface with the word “maybe”, because... I’m just speculating. No big deal; if it doesn’t apply to you then why call attention to it by denying what I never claimed to be true in the first place? 

For resources (which you didn’t ask for? but whatever) you can literally just... learn about neurotypical psychology, instead of assuming that you somehow magically know them better than they know themselves. Also maybe google some information on the nuances of what manipulation actually is, because your definition does not align with the rest of the world’s definition, which makes it wrong because that’s how language works. I’m not your high school teacher and you’re perfectly capable of learning for yourself, and honestly I’m not about to argue a rando on the internet over the subject of my degree. 😐 like, you’re not disagreeing with ME here, because I very much understand your train of thought and can empathize, you’re arguing with like the last 30 years of advances in social psychology that are very easily accessible on the internet. If you want to actually learn instead of making assumptions without evidence, that’s up to you; I never had any interest in holding your hand through it. If you want to be spoon-fed this stuff then you should probably look into receiving higher education in that field instead of expecting strangers on the internet to do that work for you. It’s up to you, and I don’t really care either way; like I said, it’s not my opinion, it’s basically the unanimous consensus of modern neurotypical psychology. A good starting point would maybe be some of the more recent research done on prosocial behavior, empathy, and social mindfulness."
soc_216669,socialskills,reddit_comment,332,"I had the same problem when I was your age. Everyone does nothing else than partying, I actually hated it and people convinced me to go out more. So I forced myself to enjoy partying for a year or two, and I got like a real major burnout which made me depressed for two years. The thing is that I always thought I was shy so I thought I need to man up and just party like everyone else. This was all before I realised I was an introvert, which means that being in noisy and crowded environments drains my energy. So what I did was back off, and live a lonely life. But that didn't work out too and gave me another depression, because even introverts needs some social interaction. What I did was to balance my life, making a calendar did help me a lot, so I can plan things I need to do, when I go out and make time for myself like reading books, gaming or enjoying being alone to fill up some energy. So when I go out, I make sure to avoid parties. I now go to shisha bars with my closest friends or to the movie, or even just walking around in the city at noons or midnight and I else spend a lot of time with my family.

But when I look back at those partying times, I don't regret anything. It made me learn that I was an introvert. It helped me being less shy and being more myself. And I also now know how to ""act"" like an extravert when it is needed.

I'm guessing you could be an introvert too, but it is up to you to find it out. But it could also be that you just don't enjoy partying. Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that you are not the only one and that there is nothing wrong with you. You are just different like many people."

soc_551281,socialskills,reddit_comment,463,"You sound very self spoken, and you're well written. Sounds like you're a creative. Remember, personalities are complex, nobody acts in a specific way at all times. To me it sounds like you're being yourself. You say things because YOU think that they are funny.

My best advice would be to learn to enjoy it. It seems like you wish you were just a ""regular"" person, but guess what you're not. Struggling to *fit in* is a gift. Put yourself in situations where you feel normal and can be creative and free.

The reason that people open up to you is because you're emotionally intelligent. I often used to feel the exact way you do. But guess what? People feel comfortable around you when being that open. If people like being around you and find you funny then it means that you're saying the right things. Also, it is not about what you say, but how you say things.

What you say doesn't matter, what matters is how your words make people feel.

On the other hand, feeling low about your self-esteem is indeed an issue that can often be helped with counselling. However, one thing that helped with my self-esteem is doing the things that I truly enjoy. You have the gift of being naturally charming.

This means that you have the ability to pursue fields and paths that most others won't be able to. Also, remember with great power comes great responsibility. Once in a while the world gets blessed with people that can spread joy.

I relate very heavily to this. My advice is, do what comes naturally to you, and things that feel smooth. I'm certain you'll realize that even though most of your peers might be able to do things that you can't. There are certain lanes that you would be able to dominate.

I highly recommend getting Linchpin by Seth Godin at your local Library or you can buy it [Linchpin](https://mikemadecontent.com/2019/02/16/11-rules-for-public-speaking-with-social-anxiety/). This book taught me the power of creation, and helped me understand that being creative and unique feels lonely, yet it is highly sought after.

If you take any thing from this comment please have it be this: The more you create content

Writing: Books, Blogs, stand up comedy etc.

Audio: Podcasting, Radio, sketches

The more fulfilled you feel.

**Sidenote:**

What helped me the most was public speaking/performing: Anything with a microphone and a stage. It helped my anxiety, and helped me learn that the way I think and believe has a direct impact on the results I get and how people receive me. Any body, can learn it. Even if you want to [public speak with social anxiety.](https://mikemadecontent.com/)

tl;dr Being different is a gift that comes with a lot of responsibilities. Do not deny yourself."
soc_160663,socialskills,reddit_comment,504,"&gt; I'm in software engineering.

I KNEW IT! 

But yeah, I can relate. A lot of guys I know that gravitated toward the sciences, actually a lot of guys in general, have issues with being in touch with their emotions. I'm not going to say I was never one of them either. Not to go full-on Oprah, but emotion is an important part of being well liked and allowing people to get to know you. Emotion is a part of you, so in order to let someone get to know you, they're going to want to see some of that.

But emotion isn't necessarily what it's made out to be. A lot of people characterize emotion as something that makes them feel happy or sad. It's sort of dramatized, because when people think of emotion, they think of the extremes.

Emotion is just how you feel about something on a personal level. You've already got the feelings there - everyone does - so the key is identifying where they come from. 

Opinions might be a good start if you want to analyze this in a somewhat methodical way. What's your favorite sports team? Let's say it's the Yankees, and be forewarned, I'm just gonna go with some sweeping generalizations here. Your perception of them is probably something like: historical powerhouse, known for huge free agency deals and trades, always have the best players, known for being a little bit arrogant about their success. So you look at each element in that set, and you can start to see what you value in a sports team. How does this carry over to what you value in a friend? A coworker? A family member? A girl you're interested in? Do you see any patterns?

I think - and this is some serious armchair psychology on my part, I am in no way trained in this - that emotion comes down to what you value. The most basic two emotions are like and dislike. As you start to realize what you value (like), you can start to see patterns in your own personality. You might have some preconceived notions about right and wrong and good and bad that don't exactly line up with what you value, or back to the subject at hand, how you feel. For example, you might ""know"" that arrogance is generally not a good character trait to have. But you might find yourself attracted to girls with a little too much self-confidence who border on prideful. And there's no problem with that. As long as you can recognize a point where it's unhealthy and dangerous, of course. But moderation is a whole other issue.

It really comes down to whether you can come to terms with who you are. Start judging everything around you. What do you like and why? When you start to recognize patterns in it, you'll get to know yourself a little better. And the better you know yourself, the easier it is to let others get to know you."
soc_921752,socialskills,reddit_comment,273,"Although I'm a soon-to-be senior in high school, I can share my thoughts on this. Talking from experience, all the closest friendships I've had so far shared this common trait: They all started with a ""click"". What I mean by that is that a good friendship starts out with this immediate sense of unity. Just like a spark, once you start talking, you immediately have this feeling that you fit together well with that person. Of course, this is in my case. 

While it did seem to start out similarly for you, one thing I need to mention is that the fire needs to keep going after the spark. I've also had cases where I thought I was gonna have promising friendships with certain people, but then became distant as time went by. Some people are just not as affectionate as they make out to be at first. Even if I did my best to maintain them, they did not give back as much as they took. Gotta say that it is a little strange that he immediately reduced interactions from that day.

However, I can tell that you're a caring person. If you believe that he is the sort of person that you can have serious conversations with, then I suggest asking him to have a talk about it, showing your concern in your friendship. As you have already given it a few days without talking, that is recommended as the next step. That's what I did most of the time I became worried, and it usually turned out alright! The decision is up to you, but I hope it goes well!"

Being a more rough and ready 38 year old man, when someone has pissed me off past my threshold, some parting shots and a block works great.

soc_239316,socialskills,reddit_comment,348,"Their is only little you can do to change your anxiety, which is a good thing so you don't have many alternatives but some clear paths.

1) The very most important thing to feel well with your friends is to feel well with yourself. Figure out what you like, pursue these likings, make hobbies a big part of your life, formulate your own thoughts well (I do that in Form of written Texts but what you shouod also do besides spending time with yourself and especially your own thoughts and opinions is too speak them out clearly. Maybe you make some sort of audio Blog where you record yourself speaking out these Texts just so you can speak for yourself in midst of Arguments or just when someone asks for your opinion on something). Being able to spend time alone with yourself makes you grow as a person and less dependent on others, which is a very vital skill to have.

2) In order to get friends you have to get out and meet new people. People will not find you just because you are at home and a pretty swell guy. It's more likely for them to notice you once you join a hobby which incorporates several people but even there you cannot remain completly passive. Most people are just as scared as you to talk to New people eventhough they are delighted to meet new friends. So go out and at times crack a joke with someone you barely know or ask someone you don't know at all a little question like ""Am I too late for the bus?"". 

You will feel more secure the more often you do these things. At some point you might feel like you collapsed and still want to just stick to the People you already know and not bother new people. That is absolutely normal, just don't let that feel weather your thinking. Sometimes the body is so lazy that you have to decide what is right and beneficial to your goal rather than going with what you feel like."
soc_310533,socialskills,reddit_comment,300,"I don't disagree with what /u/wheysteve is saying, but I feel like there is more to be said.

I think a lot of what they said is very positive reinforcement for someone who is friendly. However, you need to be aware with how much the other person is putting in.

I've seen a lot of people say ""well she touched my arm"" and then blow it all out of proportion. You shouldn't take things someone does lightly and make it a big deal, however, you should take those light things and try to expand on them.

If she is lightly touching you, do the exact same thing back to her. If she is laughing at your jokes, continue to make those kind of jokes (as long as the laugh is genuine), if she is smiling at you, smile back with the same kind of smile (nothing fake or over the top).

Make it like a tennis match. If she is giving you a lob (such as making eye contact and keeping conversation) well, you do the same. You wanna win the point? Give her something that she might have to work for. This will both make it worth your while ( you know it's a girl/guy you wanna go after) and it will make them see you are worthy of a ""chase"". 

This is, as every social interaction, a personal choice that I take. I know lots of friends who go for ""easy"" girls. Ones that they see a vulnerability almost and attack that. For me, I look at something that will accentuate (sp?) my feelings/ideally both of ours and create a growing point that we can cultivate.

However, my experience is limited so I can't exactly give real examples, but /u/wheysteve does bring up ways to connect with people. "
soc_802505,socialskills,reddit_comment,386,"Women are people, just like you. We're not aliens. The worst that could happen is rejection and that's inevitable either way. I keep saying this: relationships are a luxury, not a necessity. Women are extremely vulnerable when dating, though, so approach them carefully. No one can tell by the color of your shirt whether you're a stalker, a rapist or a murderer. No ifs or buts -mansplaining is an automatic dealbreaker. Pay attention to her body language and any signs of discomfort; respect her boundaries. Exit gracefully if she gets uncomfortable. Don't try to force anything, or much worse things than rejection are bound to happen. Give her space to assess the risks.

The bare minimum you can do consists of being well-mannered, respectful and hygienic. Those are the basics not to offend people. What else have you got to offer? There must be a reason you've never had a girlfriend. What about you is unattractive, physically or mentally? Work on that first. Enhance your features. Accept that you're not entitled to anything or anyone's attraction or attention. You've got to have something to offer to a potential partner and it looks like that's nothing much interesting at the moment. Talk to a therapist, consult a dietician for a healthy lifestyle plan, upgrade your wardrobe and your style and work on your flaws. Shift your focus from desperately wanting a girlfriend to wanting to be more confident. No woman wants to be with someone just to fulfill a need; look for someone special, or at least trustworthy and compatible.

Be an active listener, a good conversationalist, thoughtful, caring, supportive and learn how to cook and clean. Be very willing to cook and clean, too. Learn your dealbreakers -and makers. Are you fond of children? Pets? Are you looking for an independent career tigress, or a nurturing stay-at-home Mum? What's your role within a relationship? What do you find important in life? Pursue a hobby, learn a new skill, join a team or a club and become more interesting and sociable. Just get off of the dating market for a while and work on yourself, until you feel like you're worth meeting the woman of your dreams and you can accept she's not going to be anything like your fantasies.

soc_284261,socialskills,reddit_comment,765,"Okay, thanks! 

Your first example is the simplest of the bunch, because it seems to be more about personal preference and *subjective* opinion...and also because it's sounds fairly ""low stakes."" So let's start there.

*****

First: Imagine how others might receive your opinion/suggestion about which path to take, if you chose to say it like this: *""The path to our right is better, because of [your stated reasons].""* 

Logically speaking, of course, that's perfectly fine. But *emotionally* speaking, I see three problems with that. First, you're stating your opinion as though it's the truth, which leaves little room for others; second, you're stating it in a way that's inherently adversarial; and third: you're saying that your opinion is ""better"" (and suggesting that it's therefore ""right"" in this little win/lose contest), which means that you're implying that other people's opinions are ""worse"" and ""wrong"" - and who wants to feel ""worse and wrong""?

By comparison, consider this phrasing instead: *""You guys (or 'We') might enjoy the path to the right, because of [reasons that are specific to them (or to 'us')].""* 

The differences here? First, this is phrased as a suggestion rather than as ""the truth"" (thanks to that *""might""*), so it leaves room for others' input and further discussion; second, it's inclusive rather than oppositional (because even if you don't say *""we,""* you're still showing that you're seeing things from *their* perspective); and third, you've presented your opinion freely and non-judgmentally - it's just one of several options.

If I were part of that group and I heard you offer that second phrasing, here's what I'd remember: that you were thinking of *my* and of *our* best interests, which is nice of you. And that added ""niceness"" is key, because people are emotional creatures at our core, with a *really* strong emotional memory. (As the saying goes: ""People might not remember what you said or did, but they'll always remember how you made them feel."")

And critically here: 

That warm feeling would be completely independent of the actual outcome. So if the group (for whatever reason - or for no reason at all) decided *not* to take the path to the right, I'd *still* remember that you were looking out for us.

...But you know how you could blow that goodwill, even if you took that extra effort to carefully formulate and sympathetically present the second phrasing? If you were to then ""become more persistent"" and to ""try even harder"" *after* the group has decided differently - which would immediately put you into that adversarial, oppositional, ""my-opinions-are-better-than-yours"" territory. Do *that,* and I'll remember the exchange just as negatively as if you'd used the first &amp; poorer phrasing - and with either, I'll be far less likely to want to listen to your opinions the *next* time we have a choice of different paths to take.

*****

So to summarize all this: 

People will disagree with you if they feel you're being *emotionally* disagreeable, and they'll eventually just dismiss your opinions, if they feel *you're* too emotionally dismissive when you offer them.

*****

...And that's your first, ""easy"" example. 

But what about your other two work-related examples, where the stakes and consequences are much higher - and also where your opinions are *objectively* better? What changes with them?

Well...nothing, really. Because people at work are still people, and everyone wants their perspectives and opinions to be valued and considered, just like you do.

So even when you are objectively right, you *still* need to take that extra effort to be accommodating - by saying ""might"" or ""could"" instead of ""will""; by arguing not just objectively and logically, but also by showing the benefits *to the people in the room*; by leaving openings for others' opinions (one technique for this is to say: *""So what do* you *think about that option, [person]?""*), ...and then by genuinely listening to them, and actively acknowledging them, and then responding to them with kindness); and even by sometimes being willing to go along with the group, rather than digging in your heels and setting yourself apart from them, *even when their choice is objectively wrong.* 

And make no mistake: this is extra work. And it's hard work too, because it *doesn't* come naturally. And under your current circumstances, you might have to be extra-patient and get it right multiple times, without *any* reduction in people's ""frequently dismissive"" response to you, before their perception of you and their behavior starts to change.

But the good news is: this is a learnable skill. And it's an immensely valuable one.

...I hope that helps!"
soc_1445578,socialskills,reddit_comment,524,"I have a few reasons why I don't respond to messages. 

1) I get blown up consistently by many people because for some strange reason people really want to talk to me. I have thousands of followers on FB because I'm a girl so men seem to really want to talk to me which floods the real people I want to talk to. 

2) People will keep messaging me minutes after I don't respond which I find rude so then decide that because they are super needy and need constant affirmation to feed their ego I'm not going to oblige to their needs. 

3) I'm a very busy person with unmedicated ADHD that simply cannot keep up with a conversation while trying to get things done. It's impossible. I've tried and I've failed hundreds of times. If I do so much as to attempt this it ends up in me making many people irritated that I responded and then ""ghosted"" them so I've decided that not responding is much better than responding and leaving them hanging for another response. 

4) When I respond to one person people see I'm online or sometimes people will message me while in that conversation so I feel the need to message that person back and its a back and forth conversation with many people that I can't message all back in the time they want. 

5) I hate messaging and would actually disable the feature if social media apps such as Facebook would allow you to just shut if off without deactivating your whole FB account to do so. There are important times I do need to speak to someone regarding something but not just for general chit chat that would be much more suitable over the phone. 

6) That brings me to the point of most messages are pointless, ""Hey, what's up?"" that I really cannot get behind because 9/10 they already know what's up due to a status I posted or something I previously said the day before.

7) I much prefer phone calls. Like I said in number 5, phone calls would just get everything out a lot quicker and be much more productive than sending constant messages back and forth and struggling behind as I'm a small business owner who has many needs to attend to. 

8) When I'm not attending to my business needs I really just need some down time. I'm highly depressed and emotional and cannot take the weight and burden of other peoples issues. Whether that is narcissistic of me to say that I have my own issues and cannot be bothered to listen to other peoples. 

I've always wondered why people got so bothered by not receiving a response back. Personally I can't see an issue with it and always consider the million different factors that play into why someone might not respond and don't take it personally because I'm not the center of their world and neither is anybody else. They might be depressed, busy, or not up for conversation and it's not for me to judge and complain about their own personal choices. 

But that's just me."
soc_915998,socialskills,reddit_comment,108,"I am a guy in my 20s it up to you whether your keep what you believe or not, if you feel your happy with it then go if you feel your just pushing yourself to something you don't want to do then don't do it. I'm mainly focusing on my studies and don't mess around that much, didn't go club with friends, hang out etc. and I don't feel any regrets for not going in those. I'm just happy and contented with playing video games or reading books, I still hangout with friends but not too often and meet new people. Its just the preferences of people."
soc_160650,socialskills,reddit_comment,660,"Well my answer to you is the same as it is to 99% of the other posts I see here: you're overthinking it. By putting it in terms of algorithms and reverse engineering a thought process, I think you're taking a lot of the emotion out of it. Let me guess, former STEM major or working in a technical field? I'm joking, but only kind of. That's just how I'm reading into this based on the language you're using.

I feel like I should preface this by saying I have no experience using this technique (at least consciously, in the conversational way I'm talking about here), this is just a totally off the cuff answer. But I think maybe it'll be useful if my assumption about the STEM thing is correct. I studied liberal arts in school, so maybe a different perspective is what you need. 

Have you ever heard of the inverted pyramid in journalism? Basically it's a format for writing a newspaper article, a way of organizing ideas. You start with the broadest, most newsworthy information first. Something extremely general. Then you move to important details. Then other general background information. The reason it's called an inverted pyramid is because the information becomes more specific and focused the more you go down the page.

Just as a rough example:

Last Friday, police arrested a man suspected of three bank robberies in the area. The manhunt has been ongoing for weeks, and the commissioner estimates over $100,000 was taken. The suspect was caught after a brief chase, and is being held on $1 million bail.

I guess I'll let you be the judge, but I think that sounds like a fairly realistic, professional news article if you ignore the fact that it's only three sentences long. That's because it follows the inverted pyramid structure. The first sentence tells what happened: a guy got arrested because the police think he robbed some banks. The next goes into specifics: they've been looking for him for a while now, plus an additional detail of the crime. The third provides more focused detail: how he was caught and what's happening with him right now. I mean there are entire college courses on this, but that's the gist of it.

So to translate that over to something you might say in conversation:

You: Man I love penguins. Just can't get enough of those little guys.

Friend: Why is that?

You: Well I just love how playful they are. They look so happy, you never really see a sad looking penguin.

Friend: I suppose you have a point.

You: Exactly. There was this one time when I was a kid and I went to the zoo, they were feeding the penguins and this one kept tossing a fish up in the air and catching it. So goddamn cute.

Hopefully you can see where I'm going with this. As before, you can judge for yourself, but that's a basic example of a realistic conversation in my opinion. It follows a natural progression beginning with a general thought: I love penguins. The next point is that you love them because they're playful. And the next is an example of a time you saw a penguin being playful, a supporting detail if you will. 

It seems overly basic when I spell it out like that, but if you're having trouble organizing your thoughts on the fly, maybe a visual like the inverted pyramid is what you need. Anyway, I don't know if you'll find any of that useful, but I saw this question and this is what came to mind. The key is to start with the big picture, leaving room for people to ask follow up questions. If you can get them asking questions, they'll have invested something in the conversation. And that is one of the most important parts of being a memorable, interesting person (and writing a memorable, interesting news article!). Just my two cents."
soc_1276111,socialskills,reddit_comment,118,"There are two types of people in this regard- you consider being late the preferable option to being early because being early means that there is time you could have used for the things you need to do that is “wasted” essentially. Lots of people prefer to be late so they can maximize their own time. 

Other people prefer to be early because that is respectful of other peoples time- it shows them that you prioritize their time even over your own. Your friend sounds like in this group. 

Neither is wrong, but if you did show up earlier to things they would certainly recognize the social cue you might not have noticed you had been giving off."
soc_986327,socialskills,reddit_comment,108,"Although these questions may not all be ideal questions to ask a random stranger, some of them definitely are good questions to ask a person while a conversation begins to flow between two people while maybe on a date or someone you’d like to get to know a little better. I would scratch out some questions if this were a first date. 

Remember, you can ask a person what you may perceive as the best questions ever, but there would be any good conversation if the person feels as though they’re being interrogated. There’s gotta be a nice flow and transition to the conversation. Just my two cents"
soc_1516959,socialskills,reddit_comment,212,"so having not thought about it before, these are my quick reckons:

- first, the extreme ends of the scale seem fairly clear: if you were already planning to compliment the person on a particular thing then i say go for it, the fact that they beat you to it shouldn't stop you. 
- on the other end of the scale, if you don't like something or you think it's meh then definitely don't give a false compliment, just say thank you and move on. 
- in the middle, one thing I think is basically always ok (as long as you mean it) is to compliment the same thing about them that they're complimenting about you. ""I love your handbag""/ ""thanks, I love yours too!"" is a classic bonding moment.
- where it maybe starts to feel forced is if you seem to be searching for something to compliment, or if the thing you're complimenting is very far from three thing they're complimenting. ""i loved what you said in that meeting""/""thanks, I love your handbag!"" is gonna feel weird unless it's clearly deeply sincere. 

whether your reddit example falls in the first camp or the last camp for me depends on how strongly you feel about the compliment, if that makes sense?"
soc_251029,socialskills,reddit_comment,725,"I just wrote up a couple paragraphs below and finally reread the question only to realize I didn't exactly answer your question. I was going to delete it but I feel like what I said is loosely related to your struggle so ill leave it up. Hope it helps mate.

Its not a science, man. You, just have to be comfortable with yourself and it will come naturally. If your response to that statement is, ""I don't know how to be comfortable with myself"", then there is obviously a reason. Perhaps its your physical appearance. If thats the case then perhaps you should start working out or change the way you dress. I don't know how you look so that part would be up to you to figure out. There are plenty of resources right here on reddit for that sort of self improvement.

If its something other than that, and you have difficulty being comfortable around others because you don't think you are interesting or you don't have a quick wit and funny jokes, then I'm not sure what sort of advice to give you there. Sorry if I'm not much help. Basically all you need to know is that to attract people to you, you have to be comfortable with yourself first. ""Having friends"" is not a cure-all to your social issues. You have to fix yourself first.

When I was in college, I was very shy and awkward around other people. It felt like I couldn't be myself because the real me wasn't cool enough or good looking enough for other people. One night at a party, some of my friends convinced me that shaving my head would be a great idea. Seeing as I was not exactly in a state of mind to employ reason, I went along with their idea and let them shave my head. And when I say shave, I mean skin bald here, no buzz cut shit. Razor shave fucking bald. I looked like a total asshat. Being bald works really well for some people because of the shape of their head and whatnot. It also doesn't hurt to be in good shape. I had neither of these things going for me, in fact I was in rather poor shape and although I wasn't obese, I had a nice fat gut on me. For the next month or so, while my hair was still very short, I felt extremely uncomfortable. I'm not sure if it was just my anxiety, but I was convinced that everywhere I went people were looking at me like I was a circus  performer. For this entire month, I walked around completely embarassed and totally conscious of what everyone thought of me. Even more so than I already was. It was a rough month for me to say the least and I regretted it a lot. Towards the end of the month (my hair was uncomfortably short for longer than a month but I'm rounding it to a month for my own ease while I type this out) something really interesting happened. When I would walk out in public, instead of being glued to passerby's eyeballs, trying to decide if they were staring at my ridiculously shaped head or not, I was just looking straight ahead, consumed by my own thoughts, no longer concerned with what strangers were thinking about me. I went about my daily routine and had didn't let myself get worked up over the way I looked, something that in the end is so trivial.

I taught myself a priceless lesson by shaving my head, and In the end I'm really glad I did it. I taught myself that other peoples opinions of you do not have to be this uber-important standard that you measure yourself by. In the end, if someone thinks you are weird or ""not cool"", then thats their fucking problem. For all you know, maybe they're the ones that aren't cool.

This is all really easy to say in your head but its a tough thing to internalize and believe. I'm not going to recommend that you shave your head, but I'm also not going to recommend that you don't shave it either. I tried to elaborate more towards the end but its late and I'm really tired. Let me know if this doesn't make sense."

soc_955339,socialskills,reddit_comment,240,"I'm not by any means a good dancer (I'm not horrible) but I've always wanted to become very good at it. From my research you can:
- Take dancing classes. They are definitely the best way to go though most of them usually do classical dancing (at least in my area).
- Google all popular dance moves and watch yt vids to perfect each one. Focus on individual simple movements and perfect those first then combine.
- I recently bought just dance on the switch. Its a good way to  learn how to dance to different songs. Keep in mind that it's not at all accurate in tracking so it doesn't help too much with the execution of the moves.

I wanted to take dancing classes but the pandemic hit so rn i just dance like an idiot in my living room

When it comes to nightclubs, you shouldn't worry too much. Just have fun. Most club dancing classes ive seen online teach very (very) basic movements. Personally, i've only rarely seen great dancers in clubs but i havent been to that many so not sure.

Most tiktok users are edgy prepubescent teens. It's up to you on how you want to portray yourself. Easiest and safest way is to just ignore the toxic comments (even if they sometimes have a lot of likes) and respond to and like the positive ones. Your comments will get more ""normal"" over time."
soc_443882,socialskills,reddit_comment,270,"Hurt might not be the right word for it, and it isn't the *friending* itself that's pushy. It's the friending them again if they've already said no that's pushy. 

Just as an example, let's say you go out for desert and the server asks you if you want cake. You don't like cake and politely turn him down. But he comes back and asks if you want cake again. You turn him down again, not too mad because you know most people like cake. But then, he *keeps on asking.* And each time you say no, getting more and more annoyed. 

Sure, he isn't hurting you, but he's violating the boundaries you put in place by deliberately going against what you said because you've made it *very clear* that you don't want any cake.

And then, he finally gets it! But he brings you a *slice of cake* that says he's sorry. Maybe you aren't mad at him (because he is trying) but you're pretty annoyed because he's still giving you a cake you didn't want. 

Remember, the waiter doesn't have bad intentions, he just really likes the cave they have at his restaurant and wants you to have some. But the right thing to do is to respect your decision and give you what you wanted (which is no cake).

soc_671559,socialskills,reddit_comment,1380,"Ok that's what I thought initially. Your friends almost sound like they operate on a ""gang"" dynamic, in that, once someone leaves or is banned from the group they become the enemy or a target for being picked on and bullied... and THIS is not what friends do! Something is very wrong with that, and it also sounds like these individuals could either be any combination of jocks, spoiled-ass rich kids or ""Boyz from the Hood."" On that note... let me tell you a little story about me.

I know middle school and even high school can be difficult, but I also recall that I had solved these problems by the time I became a senior in high school be carefully picking my friends and associates. My dear young friend let me tell you something... I am Black and I went to an all Black school in Jacksonville, FL many years ago and before they finally integrated the students and teachers. This school had students that came from three different housing projects and a few low-income areas on the westside of town. I had to fight my way through middle school just to keep my damn lunch money and stand up for myself when one of the high school bullies decided to try and punk me. I was that Black kid who just didn't fit it with a lot of kids because I did not care for all the ghetto crap or fighting. I also spoke a little differently in terms of my vernacular which attracted problems at times. LOL I liked a wide variety of music including R&amp;B, soul, pop, rock and contemporary stuff which also translated to a variety of races on behalf of the artists that performed all of this music. I even chose a pop song to sing in my high school play, but I typically sang soul music on the talent shows. I can switch genres back and forth to this very day and think nothing of it. (I think it's very safe to say that most Black people are not into that.) I was an only child from a broken home being raised by a great-grandmother, and I was kind of different in my manner for reasons I was yet to fully understand until I became an adult. As for high school... hell I didn't even TRY to associate with people or groups that acted too ""street, violent or ignorant."" I just stayed the hell away from them because I knew I didn't really like them. However, I managed to get a little tougher to the point where the vast majority of this bunch would leave me alone as well because they could see it in my face that I didn't want to be bothered. I learned to stand up to them if provoked, and if someone pushed me too far then someone had a real fight on their hands. (People have a way of knowing who to mess with and who not to mess with... believe this.) I met up with a guy in a nightclub (or disco) who attended my high school several years after we'd all graduated. He came out and told me that he used to watch me in school and noticed the way I used to select my friends which really surprised me because he and I were never actual friends, and I didn't really think ANYONE paid attention to the few people I hung with except me! LOL Well he was right because I made it a point to only associate myself with kids who acted and carried themselves like regular well-mannered (or semi-well mannered) kids. They weren't ""perfect"" people and neither was I, but NONE of them were ignorant, ghetto, delinquent, violent or bullies. I didn't even try to date girls who acted like ""hood girls"" because I knew they represented one lane and I was driving in another. I found myself attracted to young ladies who ACTED like young ladies (and married one just like that). The bottom line is that I hate and literally despise ghetto mentality and behavior to this very day... and even moreso now because I know myself, and I have accepted who I really am as a person and an individual. If you want to say childhood and school experiences contributed to this strong dislike for ghetto behavior then you would not be wrong. lol 

Now back to you. I told you some of my personal story as a means of telling you that you are going to get a little tougher and ""stand up for the person you really are inside."" When you make the decision to do this then trust me... it will show on the outside because it will be genuine. You need to continue to speak your mind not only to this group and group leader you've told us about, but with ""anyone"" because practice is good. You should also ""focus more on your future"" in terms of your college major and the career you hope to have one day. Immerse yourself in people and activities that ""make you smile"" and focus more on the people you like instead of those whom you dislike. If you start to do more of these things, you will find that you won't even have TIME to deal with this troublesome group or any other type of nonsense to start with. Maybe it's just time to stop trying to fit-in where you no longer fit-in and move on. Just become too busy.  

I think I understand your feelings, concerns and need to separate yourself on a more gradual basis, and I respect them as well... so go ahead and do it gradually, but you can also do it more quickly if you make some changes in your own life and thinking. Start allowing yourself to experience and enjoy the company of other people whom you might have more in common with in terms of personality, interests understanding of the words ""mutual respect."" You need to move beyond this group of flakey and shakey individuals with a jerk for a ring leader because there's just something wrong with this group dynamic... and it really doesn't sound right for you because it's not who you are. You just seem to be more down-to-earth, intelligent that calm person who tolerates these people just to have friends, and people like you deserve better. 

Now here is where it gets really serious: If the spirit ever leads you to do so... you should pull the group leader away from the rest of the group or catch him or her alone one day and flat confront them about their behavior. It doesn't have to be angry... just be honest straight-forward, logical, vary rational but above all.. UNAFRAID. You will get better and more interesting results if you do this privately because if you try it in front of the group it could get ugly because you will have put this jerk on the spot and he/she will react in whatever way they deem necessary to hold power. lol If ever you decide to do this, you absolutely cannot be nervous, afraid or unsure of yourself in any way because he or she will sniff it out, sense it and try to pull a power play of some sort. You have to be ready for whatever no matter what and ready to deal with it. If it sounds like I'm saying you might even have to exchange a few punches that's exactly what I'm saying. Whatever you decide to do and however you decide to handle it... you have to stand up for yourself one way or another because you will encounter these type of people long after high school is over. I also want you to talk to your mom and dad or an older brother, sister, cousin or even a grand-parent about everything you've told me and see what they tell you as well. I will stop now, but I want you to have a great rest of your weekend and a good life. I've got a feeling great things are in store for you one day in your life, and everything you are experiencing and feeling now will help make it all come true.

Peace"

Yes I think sometimes the word date can just be scary so I’d say the second option would be a good way to go for it! If either of you has a dog or cat or some animal to walk? That’s a great way to break the ice. Movies aren’t good because you don’t really get time to actually chat. Or if she likes sports or something like hey let’s shoot some hoops or even some other activity that isn’t sports. 

Third just gotta trust yourself and your decision making.

Reflect (mirror), paraphrase, and ask follow-up questions.

Reflect (aka ""mirroring)"": 
""I went swimming yesterday!""
""You went swimming yesterday.""

Paraphrase:
""I went swimming yesterday!""
""You went for a dip, eh?""

Follow-up/clarification questions:
""I went swimming yesterday!""
""Really? Did you head to X lake, or to Y pool?"" and perhaps even ""How was it? It's early in the year; was the water cold?"" and even additionally ""Do you go often, or just every once in a while? Like, are you on a swim team or something, or was this just for fun?""

soc_469226,socialskills,reddit_comment,931,"Girls often travel in packs at social events not just for fun or to insulate themselves from “undesirable” gents, but often for safety. It’s a layer of protection against getting drugged, raped, and/or murdered. 

You clearly mean well, but girls don’t know that and have to make a calculation  of risk every time a bloke approaches them. Work on making your body language and behavior as friendly and nonthreatening/non-creepy as possible, so when they make that judgment, they have more reason to trust you than be wary of you. Don’t spend the evening gawking/staring longingly at them and then approach- trust me, they’ve already noticed, are probably creeped out, and probably already have a strategy to deflect you should you approach. If you are caught looking, smile and give a small wave. Then, not immediately but somewhat soon after, approach. Use open, relaxed body language- no crossed arms, good posture, eyes up but still not gawking, a small smile. 

(I don’t think I need to say this, but just in case since I don’t know the level of experience with which I’m dealing: look and BE clean. You don’t have to be GQ cover material or look like you stepped out of Milan Fashion Week, but wear something clean, unstained, and unwrinkled that fits. Wear antiperspirant, not just deodorant. It’ll prevent pit stains, especially in crowded bars and when you’re nervous. Go easy on the cologne. Please have showered recently (like in the past 48 hours). I know this seems stupidly basic, but trust me...I’ve seen perfectly great guys faceplant socially because of this.) 

Don’t necessarily try to get rid of the friends right away- that is a huge red flag for us. We travel in packs in part for protection, remember? Plus, it opens up your potential social/dating/getting laid pool exponentially. Sometimes the woman who grabs your eye isn’t a match, but one of her friends is. Trust me, I’ve seen this work. Keep an open mind. 

Try to engage specifically, particularly around an activity or a topic of conversation. Grab your wingman and ask if they’d like to play a couple rounds of darts or start up an impromptu billiards tournament, loser of the round buys the winners drinks. If you want to chat, pick something you know based on visual cues (like a jersey or comic book shirt) or something you’ve heard them talking about and ASK A QUESTION ABOUT HER THOUGHTS/OPINIONS AROUND THAT TOPIC. Then listen. People love to talk about themselves- this is a recommended strategy for everything from first dates to job interviews. Bonus points if you can engage her friends’ opinions too. This means less work for you to keep the conversation alive. 

If you’re going off your eavesdropping, begin with, “Sorry, I couldn’t help but overhear. I was wondering...”. That way it doesn’t come off as “hi I’ve been listening in to you all night waiting for the perfect time to make my entrance.” It also shows that you, y’know, have manners - which are a pretty hot commodity in the age of Tinder and dick pics. 

I’m sure you’ve heard this before, but don’t turn it into “hi I’m here to quiz you on this topic to assess your knowledge and/or explain this thing to you when you didn’t ask.” Remember, let the ladies do most of the talking and you’ll come off as more likable. 

Another approach: if you want to buy the girl a drink, offer to buy her a drink OR a bar snack/kebab/food truck item of her choice (these options should be as close by as possible).A) it’s generally cheaper for you if she picks food and B) it comes off as “hey I want to do something nice for you, your choice” rather than “I’d like to get you drunk so you’ll go home with me.” 

The exception to the group rule is if you’re at a club or function with dancing. You can totally approach her (using open, confident, approachable body language as described earlier) and ask “Would you like to dance for a bit?” or “May I have this dance?”. Just a smile and question, no theatrics. This phrasing also indicates to her that she has an out if the wants to leave- the duration is stated or implied. 

When you approach, keep an eye on the response. If the girls spot you and suddenly tense up or close themselves off (cross arms, tighten circle, turn backs to you), that’s a signal you are not welcome and should try talking to someone else. Ignoring these signs says “hey, I’m not paying attention to your feelings/comfort because I’m 100% focused on what I want” which is a recipe for disaster. Why would you want to go where you’re not welcome, anyway? If you do get to talking, keep an eye out for these signs and take that as your cue to make a graceful exit. (Looking at your phone and making a vague excuse about leaving is 100% okay and preferable to just wandering off.) Thank them for a good time as you leave. 

I really don’t mean any of this in a condescending manner- this is coming from my + my friends’ experiences socializing with unfamiliar guys. A lot of men don’t realize they’re coming off as threatening (or just rude) when they mean well. Overall, remember 2 major things:
1) Women really just want to be treated as people rather than idols/mythic beings.
2) Statistically, women have a lot more reason to be scared of you than you are of them. 

Hope this helps!"
soc_1586398,socialskills,reddit_comment,307,"I think what you have been saying is definitely okay.  Some people are sensitive to those that are quiet; it's normally something on their end that makes them feel insecure about it.  (in my experience)

Learning to soften your eyes and mouth while working will give you an advantage of looking more approachable and will make looking up to smile or speak easier.  Customers want to be greeted and seen, so you could try engaging them with a nod, smile, or hello upon their arrival to your cafe.  It's generally crucial to make someone feel invited, comfortable and noticed upon entering a new place (and upon leaving too).

It's painful trying to put together a conversation when you're busy thinking about the bread in the oven, the coffee pot needing tended to, what needs to be ordered, etc. Practicing mindfulness and focusing on your customer when they come up to you helps.  

I find cracking jokes and smiling to be the easiest way to show someone I am relaxed and approachable.  I do also have a face I plaster on for when I'm serious and would rather not be interrupted.  I feel in your case, maybe your body language is giving off some 'cooler' vibes. 

When you're grasping at straws to engage with someone, I will almost always make a remark about what they are purchasing or what they've eaten.

Example: They ordered a prosciutto panini and a cup of tea.  When they approach the counter to pay and you've run out of small talk you can always show enthusiasm over their order.  ""Oh gosh, I just love our paninis; we use local prosciutto from *this* butcher!  Did you enjoy it?"" or  ""Oh man, if you liked *this*, you should try *this* next time"".  Something along those lines, but tailored to how you speak of course lol."
soc_1809951,socialskills,reddit_comment,142,Remember that you’re a person too. The same way you may worry about what people think of you is the way they may worry about what you may think of them. Everybody tries to seem much cooler when you first meet them than they actually are. First meetings are always strange in a way. People like talking about themselves. You could ask them how their day has been or how their weekend was and they’ll probably start to like you when they see that you care about them. Even if you don’t really care to hear about their outside lives lol Always be encouraging but never at the sake of your own self respect. When they respond just say “nice!” Or “that’s neat.” As an introvert that’s what I have done and people eventually warm up to you as you to them
soc_169465,socialskills,reddit_comment,180,"When you say you ""asked her to go out with you"" do you mean you asked her to be your girlfriend?  Because back in the stone ages, when I was a kid, we'd say ""will you go out with me"" and that meant will you be my girlfriend/boyfriend.  I ask, because you mentioned that this was a relationship.  If that's not how you meant it, then I would probably refrain from calling it a relationship.

But, I would suggest trying to find a balance.  You don't want to be overbearing, but you also don't want to ignore her.  Just be really happy to see her.  Greet her when she shows up.  Make an effort to be near her and talk to her, maybe make some small talk about your upcoming plans, but don't go on and on about them obsessively.  And also talk to other people.

You don't want to act aloof, but you also don't want to be needy...  ya know?  You should be obviously happy and excited to see her, but not insanely happy, if that makes sense.

soc_128100,socialskills,reddit_comment,358,"Just my opinion because when it comes to dancing different people learn in different ways. I've been to several dance studios and learned quite a few types of dancing and here is what I have found.

You need to learn to be comfortable moving. Learning something different but similar will cross over. There are a lot of comments about just watch youtube or that no one teaches club dancing, but you can still learn to dance. Find a place that does swing lessons. You are not going to bust out swing moves to Usher, but it will teach you to move with the rhythm and build confidence. It makes dancing in clubs much easier.

See if you can find a studio in your area that teaches coed, non couple classes.  A lot of studios teach a couple to dance. This builds a lot of bad habits. You learn to dance very well with that one person but that is it Some studios make you switch partners every 5 minutes. I love these studios. You learn to dance with different types of people with different dance styles. It also lets you meet different types of people. It is just all in all a good experience.

Don't be scared of music that just isn't your taste. I started with two step because a friend talked me into it. I don't like country music, but country dancing is some of the funnest I do. The only time I listen to country is when I'm dancing.

A lot of country and latin clubs teach free lessons early in the evening or when things are slow. Again--don't be afraid of music you don't like. Think of it as a cultural experience. It is almost like traveling to a foreign country in your own town.

Some rotary clubs and civic centers will have a sock hop night. Some of these include lessons.

A lot of colleges will have continuing education classes on dancing. Learning the foxtrot just doesn't sound cool anymore, but it will teach you the basics of moving your feet and you might meet some people that will be friends for life."
soc_41110,socialskills,reddit_comment,220,"There was a time in my life when I'd say I was pretty uptight.  And now in pretty silly, funny, goofy.  It took time and experience.  One big changer was I had a rare opportunity at 16 to spend time in Japan, all expenses paid, touring with a bunch if other teens.  I had an amazing time but when I came back I realized I could have had a seriously better time had I not been worrying about what other people thought of me.  I never forgot that and since that time I also learned that when I let myself be silly, it puts others at ease too which makes for easier socializing.  

Sometimes when speaking, I mismatch phrases (spoonerisms) and some people stop and do a dog me take as if they think I'm stupid and I never care.  People realize I wasn't born here so I don't always get phrases right.  I'm also clumsy.  I just let myself be and have realized others are relieved because it means they can be themselves and I won't judge.  The Doctor is a tough one.  He's special ;). So aim to take parts of yourself that you know are like him already but that you don't show.  Don't try to create parts that don't exist.  I hope that helps a little."

Having reasons helped me understand clear when it comes to commitments. A big part of self-love is being protective of your time and energy. Don’t you think setting boundaries around your time, energy, emotions, mental health, and space important? Your resources aren’t as abundant as they are at other times, so protecting what you have becomes very important. Usually we don’t have the energy to spare. And I can honestly say that I don’t suffer from fomo. I could be invited to a social and work gathering but id decline because I’m clear about my purpose and motivations.

The choice is up to you, are your reasons, commitments, time, energy, emotions, or purpose important to you? Is it important enough to protect?"

I can't tell you what to do in this situation, but please don't ask someone like me a direct question too abruptly. If you could think of a way to give someone like me a bit of warning to think of something to say before passing the conversation to me, I would probably be a lot less nervous and a lot more articulate.

soc_1635083,socialskills,reddit_comment,275,"Here's what helped me.

I was having a conversation with a friend and to my surprise, he said ""I wish I was charismatic like you."" That is probably one of the last things I'd use to describe myself. How could he be so far off? I realized that I've also been called talkative, and quiet, and nice, and also rude because of my social anxiety. All of these are different, so which of these is true about me?

I realized that there were many different perceptions of me and that the only person who could really define those things about me, is me. After all, nobody else is in my head.  Oftentimes people judge you based on what they see without even knowing 10% of you.

There will be tons of different perceptions of you and not all of them will be positive. As long as you believe that you are nice, funny, empathetic, etc. that's what matters. Anyone who disagrees simply has an incorrect perception of you. Just because people perceive you a certain way doesn't make it the truth. Only you can know the truth about yourself.

This is why having a healthy self-esteem is important. Because let's say you're self-conscious about being boring. If someone finds you boring, you'll internalize it because deep down you believe that to be true. If you don't think that you're boring, then somebody finding you boring will be seen as the two of you being incompatible rather than an accurate perception of yourself.

You want to stop caring what others think? Learn yourself and work on your self-esteem. That is the best advice I can give"
soc_688835,socialskills,reddit_comment,740,"Hey Sendy,

I hear you, son.  I have 2 boys myself (youngest is 15) and I feel your pain.

This is the thing:  

You matter, Sendy.

Your Parents may not acknowledge you, hug or say they love you.  

They may act like they don’t give a d*mn about you — like my Dad did to me.

It’s the most painful thing in the world when you’re made to feel unloved.

But I’m telling you, Sendy.  

You matter.

You are a loveable kid.

It’s not your fault you got the short end of the Parenting Stick.

You deserve better than that.

How can I say that when I don’t even know you?

Because every, single child deserves their parents love.

Period.

Parents may not like the kids behavior, but we should always make sure we show our kids love (Especially during their developing years!)

It’s tough.
No parent is perfect.

We all make mistakes - (Some worse than others.)

But no matter what, you don’t deserve this kind of treatment, Sendy.

I had to live with my Dad while he abused me in almost every way imaginable from age 2 to age 13.

And I am here to tell you, Sendy, that no matter how difficult this gets for you, you will survive.

I can tell you are a smart and strong person because you had the courage to reach out and ask for help with your situation.

And when you go through your life from this time forward, you will overcome this unfortunate series of events.

Because YOU can be a better person to other people than your Parents were to you.

Over time, as you grow older, you can learn how to reach out and show love to people, in spite of being hurt.

You can learn, even at this stage of your life, to make better choices than they did.

And as you grow and mature, there will always be a part of your heart that misses the love from your Mom and Dad that you never had.  

No one can replace their love — and that sucks.  

I know EXACTLY how that feels!!!

But you can still have an excellent life, Sendy.

It’s all up to you how you will handle this.

Because the worst thing you can do is put a wall up and never let anyone in again.

There are good people in the world you can trust your heart with.  

They are TRULY out there.  

You may not  believe me now because you are 13 and you’ve been seriously mistreated.

But I have 40 more years of life experience than you do — because I’m 53.

So I know.

They are there.

And you can find them.

But it does take time.

And you can be patient and find your people, like I did.

I found a great husband and raised my kids with all the love and attention I didn’t get growing up.

It’s a beautiful thing, considering where I came from.

I hope you remember that some kids can be smarter than their parents, and to me you seem to be one of those kids.

Some day, you will grow up, and have a good life with a wonderful family.

And what you will do is give them ALL the love you never got because you’ll never want them to feel unloved like you did.

And you will listen to them because you will never forget how it felt like you didn’t matter when you weren’t heard.

But it’s all up to you.

You can wall yourself off if you want, but it’s a lonely place to be. 💗 💗 💗 

I just hope someday you consider leaving your heart open to love, Sendy.

Because you have a lot of gifts that the world may never see if you choose to keep that wall up.

And the world NEEDS the gifts that only YOU can give.

In the meantime, hang in there.

And know that what your Mom and Dad do (or doesn’t) do has NOTHING to do with you, and EVERYTHING to do with their shortcomings as human beings.

It’s not your fault.

They should know better!!  They are responsible for this situation — NOT YOU.

None of us grownups are perfect — and clearly, some of us are WAY more screwed up than others!

Love and Prayers for You, Sendy.
Truly,
Everything will be all right.
💗 💗 💗

soc_1711503,socialskills,reddit_comment,109,"Maybe think of it this way. If you feel like you look ugly but  wake up every day convincing yourself that you're feeling ok about it, does that make it still feel ok if someone else just comes up to you and says ""hey ur ugly""

I've always been a bit self conscious about my social skills because I'm pretty unapologetically quirky. I try my best to accept all other people and to not give them any reason to feel terrible, so when someone says something which could only be hurtful, I think I tend to take it quite personally. As if the intention multiplies what was actually said."
soc_1134672,socialskills,reddit_comment,230,"I think your feelings are both valid, you have a right to feel upset and frustrated bc it sucks when someone your trying hard to communicate with won’t communicate back, but if you already know that this really only happens when you ask how she is, why do you keep asking? I know its normal to ask but if i asked someone how they were and they left me on read more then 3 times then, i would know they dont feel comfortable answering that question with me and I would stop asking. What shes doing is setting healthy boundaries in her own way, she doesnt want to communicate her feelings, which is perfectly valid, but unfortunately the way shes going about it is rude. However you understand she’s depressed and shes not going to be her  at her best right now and its common for us depressed ppl to get frustrated or irritated more easily. I think that if you want to salvage this friendship, take some time to reflect and how your feeling and continue if you are ok with someone being rude to you sometimes bc of the circumstances. Also realize how she is setting her boundaries ( it being rudely unfortunately) and be like ok she doesnt like this question i wont ask. its all up to you how you want to handle the situation tho"
soc_279111,socialskills,reddit_comment,473,"Congratulations on asking for her number. This right here is an accomplishment that you should not take likely. The result of this interaction doesn't matter. It's kind of like going to the gym. It's great to actually get yourself there but you can't expect to see immediate results simply by going once. You have to keep going until you get the results you want to see.

You are not an idiot. You are a man who went for what he wanted. How is that a bad thing? Rejection is not bad. I love being rejected, not as much as getting a yes, but i love it nonetheless. Why? Because it means that I not only got out of my comfort zone but that I would also be able to move on to the next one.

Don't take rejection so personal. There are a million and so reasons why someone would reject you. Similarly to why you haven't asked out every girl you meet or see. Sometimes you are not someones type, sometimes they are too busy to even consider it, other times they are already seeing someone, etc.... So don't take it personal. If you do want to do something about rejection then work out, work on yourself, and build a life of your own.

As for seeing this girl. She rejected you. Does that mean she's a piece of shit? Nope. Does this mean you can't be friends or even be civil toward each other? Nope. So don't make it awkward by being awkward. If she makes it awkward it's on her, it's not your fault. If you do really want to get her number and stuff then I'd suggest waiting. Become friends with her, show each other your individual value. Notice I said show not tell. You do this by being yourself. I've had girls who I've initially asked out become some of my closest friends. I've also ended up going out with girls who had originally rejected me. I've also been rejected and they became really bitchy toward me after I originally thought they were decent/cool people. 

Once again, Rejection is not bad. You want to be with someone who wants you too, right? Then rejection is a great way to filter the people who don't. You're not an idiot, any less of a man, or any less courageous. Don't be afraid of asking girls out. This comes with practice and you'll learn to not place your worth on getting yes's or even reacting negatively do a rejection. It's a thing that happens in life because not everybody is going to like you and each person has a personal preference of who they want to date. 

tl;dr Rejection is not bad. Don't make it awkward. You did great by asking her out even if the results weren't what you wanted"
soc_55383,socialskills,reddit_comment,163,"This is great that you're asking this and it shows that you want to make a serious change in your behavior. It honestly depends on how you want to approach the change that you want to make. I would suggest trying to be more specific in what you actually want to do. Saying I want to have fun is actually very vague even though it implies a general [purpose](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/329837-cat-where-are-you-going-alice-which-way-should-i). The reason you need to be specific is because it helps you reach the goal of what you want to achieve as in you need to break the larger goal into smaller steps. So, I'll just say in general at least from my own personal bias, that I recommend trying to do more[ physical activity](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/faq#wiki_getting_started) and any kind of exercise on a regular basis and try [meditation](http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/wiki/faq).These two things will help boost your energy quite significantly and address the lethargy and loneliness.

soc_298856,socialskills,reddit_comment,297,"It's part of the deal. Your limits will be tested and your boundaries will be pushed by bosses and coworkers alike. That's what you get paid for.
Unless they're your superior or supervisor your coworkers can't tell you to do anything. They can ask you to do something and when you refuse either accept your refusal and work out some other solution for their problem, or they can go cry to your boss about it. Guess which one is more common? Now guess again. It's up to you to judge if you can affort using your worktime to do your collegues favours. Don't expect your back to be scratched in return though and don't do them favours just so you'd ""get along"". Set boundaries lest you become the office slave/lackey. Coming back from that, which I have to do now, is a near impossible task.
Your boss doesn't need a reason to make you do something other than that they are your boss. Challenging them or ignoring them is telling them that you don't understand how things are organised at your workplace, or that you are not willing to do your part. This will come at a price.  If you want to debate the task you're getting assigned, ask questions. Ask why it has to be done this way and why they think you're the best person to do it. Point out where you disagree (ie what you think is 'stupid' about the task) and wait for their feedback. If you get anything other than 'okay, you don't have to do it' or 'okay, try it your way', then you're going to have to do it, and do it quick and good enough for them to forget you challenged them, if you want to keep that job."
soc_1175473,socialskills,reddit_comment,570,"&gt;For the emotional part of things, maybe this can help you, it did for me, I kind of got carried away, I understand if you dont want to read, lol. and srry for any spelling and grammar mistakes, english is not my native language.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is something called fundamental thinking, its usually used to solve problems and other things but I used it to fragment my emotions,  
&gt;  
&gt;Usually in most situations we find ourselves feeling a lot of things, mixed fellings, to get over that situation we need first to identify what are the basic feelings.  
&gt;  
&gt;We can do this by comparing, if we have a mixed state of feelings lets call it ""A"" if we want to know if anger is part of A, we need to know something that makes us feel pure anger, then we compare both states and determine if anger belongs to state ""A"", we then follow to other fragments, until we have a clear idea of what basic fellings compose ""A"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Then we assign each felling to a statement that describes the situation that provoked ""A"", for example, lets put a situation: your girlfriend cheats on you; and state ""A"" we have determined its compossed by, anger, fear, sadness, and betrayal.  
&gt;  
&gt;we need to assigne each feeling to a statement  
&gt;  
&gt;for exameple we feal anger towards the person she cheated with.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;we can realize that by creating different situations in our heads  
&gt;  
&gt;if she had not cheated but lied about somthing, or dreamt about someone, would we still feel the anger? if no, then we know that because there was another person, we relate the anger to that statement. if yes, then we know the other person is not realted to the anger feeling but rather we feel anger towards something else. and we continue the process of looking for what statment matches the emotion, until he have all feelings matched  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;after this we can start debating and reasoning to get over each individual feeling  
&gt;  
&gt;in this example  
&gt;  
&gt;anger is felt towards the other dude  
&gt;  
&gt;fear is felt towards the possibility of the girlfriend leaving, or maybe to the fact we will be alone after the breakup  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;sadness to the fact that she cheated maybe because you did something wrong  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;and betrayal because well she betrayed you  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;we start reasoning  
&gt;  
&gt;the anger and the other dude, if you are not going to see them again, well there is nothing to do, if not, confront him maybe.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;the fear, depends on what you think, if you still want to try with your girlfriend or not,  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;sadness asking her why she did it will clear the reasons  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;and betrayal wil be resolved by her saying she is sorry, if you forgive her, if not, well we can dig deeper to resolve those feelings  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;and thats it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Maybe it will help you maybe not, everyone is different.  
&gt;  
&gt;But this helped me thorugh highschool.  
&gt;  
&gt;The major benefit is that you learn a lot about yourself and the major advantage of that is that you learn to be with yourself, and that is something that is missing in most people at this time, where internet connects us all."

The bill was so small one of my sisters picked it up. Mom brought the cake. More friends and family could come because they had the rest of the day to themselves. No mess for anyone to clean up. I went to the lake with friends for the evening.

Plan your own special days. Then you'll be less disappointed. 

All the best to you! Hope your next year is a better one. And start planning your 21st birthday now! 🎂 Do you want to sky-dive? Horse-back riding? Do Disney? It's your choice."
soc_891111,socialskills,reddit_comment,286,"""I finally feel okay for once in my life but I'm struggling with just ""being"". Like....wtf does that even mean???""

I think the problem here is the pressure we put on ourselves to ""be'' (that is, to exist contained in an identity that allows us to navigate the world) a certain way. I don't think there is a ""true"" self underneath our many layers that we desperately try to uncover. All there is is a complex web of ideal patterns of behavior that we believe we have to adhere to + our genetic disposition. That can be very scary to accept because it makes us feel lost, but it is a great thing. It means that we don't have to \*be\* anything. This doesn't mean we don't need an identity or that all that we think makes us who we are really doesn't. No, it just means ""I"" becomes a conscious creative act instead of an abstract ceiling that you impose on yourself. You can keep the parts of yourself you genuinely like, you can experiment, you can learn about your predispositions and accommodate; it's all up to you but always do it with gentleness towards yourself. 

""My personality just seems so lackluster compared to others and I struggle being myself when I'm with other people, especially family. I've only been really close to a few friends and even then I wasn't fully myself.""

I think we feel our personality is fragmented when we don't have a solid sense of who we are and that damages our self-esteem. We don't know how to present ourselves to the world. The depleted self-esteem causes us to be afraid of being judged so we hide when we're around others."

Just imagine in your head that she’s also  a human being like you… that means she pees/poos/ farts and has body odour issues when unwashed. She has bad breath in the morning, she burps after gorging on chocolate cookies etc. 
Don’t view her as a sexual object. She’s s living/ breathing human being who has insecurities/ fears/ emotions just like you. 
Talk to her like you’d talk to another guy.
Stop starring at a girl and just go over and introduce yourself. Imagine the above scenarios in your head and the sexual neediness will disappear. 

A girl needs to feel safe and comfortable before she’ll let you into her world. By behaving like you do in front of girls you’re sending her vibes that you’re unsure of yourself and therefore she won’t feel safe and comfortable opening up to you."

She’s really touchy too. This nice looking girl comes up to you talking to you and touching you gives you that idea. But I think she just sees everybody as a friend by default.

soc_263503,socialskills,reddit_comment,181,"It's the type of people you surround yourself with. You can avoid this by not being around individuals who apparently don't let you speak or interrupt you, although I do recommend you actually make your friends aware of how you feel about this situation. If they do care about you, then they'll also understand what you are saying, if they don't change behavior, then I'm not even sure I'd call those people for friends in the first place. I've never heard of meaningful friendship or relationship, where something was one-sided. Extroverts and Introverts can communicate very differently, as well as their awareness of others can be vastly different. I've always let someone speak when they do start talking, and I'll also listen with great interest, because I actually care when others are interacting with me. As to how you choose to approach your friends about this issue is entirely up to you, I just hope you do  it, because you deserve the attention as much as anyone else, plus it'll help your confidence when you feel you are being heard :)"
soc_927692,socialskills,reddit_comment,220,"To an extent looks do matter, just as long as you’re not super ugly you will probably have a chance with some girls. If you have a good personality and you’re confident in yourself (not in a narcissistic way) you’ll appear more attractive. Don’t worry about attracting girls but practice self love/self care and be comfortable in your own skin.

The fact that you even thought about paying someone to like you is counterproductive because the people around you seem to be very shallow, so money won’t help you with those people. Sure, you can pay them to like you but they’re just sucking up to you because they’re getting free money but if you do run out of money they’ll disappear in a blink of an eye.

You should pursue your hobbies to get away from those shallow people, and eventually you’ll find someone who will genuinely like you and they won’t ask you for anything (materialistic or to use you) so just wait until the right person comes into your life. 

Of course, it won’t happen right away but it’s hard to find someone who will have a deep relationship with someone, especially in our society where people tend to be more selfish. Believe in the universe and it will come to you when the time is right."
soc_1079953,socialskills,reddit_comment,475,"Sorry for the long comment, but i felt like this for a long time before realizing it, hope it can help!

Hey don't get down! It has been proven that intelligence is not in the same form and in the same things for everyone, but instead everyone has a different type of intelligence and sensibility. I know that being different from others is difficult, especially when you aspire to become like them, but you need to understand that we are not all the same (luckily!) and everyone differing from the ""smart"" sterotype that the media and popular knowledge helped creating is stupid. Moreover i think that smart and intelligent are way different things, as in the former it is just having an ability to understand what is happening and how to react, while the latters means that you are able to understand and analyze critically complex concepts and ideas. I don't know about you but if i had to choose between the two i would always choose being intellignet, since it gives you the ability (especially when paired with reading philosophy/sociology/mythology/pshychology) to really understand the world and why things are done in this way.

  
Going back to your question, i dont think that you can become ""more intelligent"" since intelligence is something that is genetically driven, but everyone is different. Moreover in today's society having someone who reads a lot is a fuckign blessing, since the majority of people now just look at their phones 24/7 and have the attention span of a goldfish. As an advice i would say to try to become more practical by trial and error and by testing yourself in real situations, obioviusly ackward moments will happen, but that is what makes us grow in the end right? Moreover if you really like reading, especially academic essays, you should definitely start reading more about philosophy, and history, not only they are really interestign and help you understanding why things exists and are done in particular ways (and are amazing conversation topics that can make you appear really smart, if that is your final goal). 

Moreover i would avise youin changing your attitude,  becoming more interested and eager to understand everything, instead of stopping at the ""i'm not able to understand this"" since things can be explained in many different levels of complexity who enyone can enjoy.

soc_356679,socialskills,reddit_comment,387," Just my opinion, but I think you're making your life a lot harder than it has to be.  You're putting a bunch of stuff in other ppl's heads, like what they must be thinking, and a bunch of rules and expectations literally no one else on the planet has in their heads.

So what if you're 24 and have no experience with girls.  There's no collusion going on with every woman on the planet.  Inexperienced guys can be better because they're not creeps, they're sweet.  If you can understand that you're misunderstanding everyone else you'll ever interact with, you'll be better off than most people who think everyone else has to agree with them or they deserve to get rejected by their tribe.

I would ask you to try meetup.com or volunteering, maybe at an animal shelter, but it might just make your anxiety worse.  I've learned to stay away from most experiences with other people and just wait for them to approach me, but that's usually because they think I'm the person I look like, not the person I am.  The person I am is too messed up to be tolerated by anyone else for long.

Watch out for the way you idealize what you want, too.  You don't just want a partner, you *need* other people in your life you feel safe connecting to.  The thing you think you want, that 'one other person,' doesn't exist for anyone.  We're all changing all the time and you don't want just anyone, you want something you think is out there that will make everything better.

No one else can do that for you.  No one else will ever make your life better, you're the only one that can do that.
The upside, though, is *no one else can make your life worse, either.*

Glad to hear you're getting counseling, even if it's weak.  Learn about all of the resources you can find and try them each at least once to see if they're helpful for you.  See if you can join a men's group, that will help set expectations for yourself and women/partners.  Some of the stuff you're describing is not about how anyone else is, it's how you've defined yourself and what you expect everyone else to believe, and that's what CBT treatment is all about.

It gets the point across that you'd like get in touch and get to know her better, while giving her the opportunity to feel comfortable with the idea first. I'm a woman, and if I were to be put on the spot and asked for my number I would panic and might reject him immediately just to find an instant response because the anxiety would be overwhelming for me. Or if the need to be polite struck me I might give it to him whether I wanted to or not. This would get his hopes up and probably crush him when I avoided him if I regretted the decision. Obviously everyone is different and some women might not be as anxious as I am, but a guy giving me their number instead would give me the opportunity to go home and think about whether I would want to get to know him more. Being comfortable and having time would likely influence me to consider him more."
soc_136621,socialskills,reddit_comment,169,"There's a difference between not causing pain to another human being and being obligated to make another person happy. In the social, private, sphere, how you spend your free time is completely up to you. Don't turn this into some freshman-level philosophizin'. 

As for the laws and morals? You're, like, half-correct. Our laws and morals are always engaged in a balancing act, catering to both private life and public life. In the domain of your private life (which I assumed was the implied domain of discourse), you don't owe anyone anything. Socializing in this regard isn't a moral issue, it's a private one. Ya dig?

Plus, if you're using the whole utilitarian metric, you get into murky waters because you'd have to find out if it would hurt the other person more to ignore them or to tell them to their face that you find them too lacking to be friends with. There's not a cut and dry answer here.

If I'm having a chill, casual text convo with someone, receiving a long ass paragraph will probably turn me off replying. I generally don't use long paragraphs unless I'm doing an info blast where I want to disseminate as much info as possible. You're texting, not writing an email. It's tiring to have to read through your entire paragraph when all I want is to have some chill times.

In general, excitement through text isn't shown through the length, but the content. For example, if I'm trying to convey excitement, I'll use a lot more caps like ""LOL"" or ""HAHAHA"". Long paragraphs don't get that sentiment across."
soc_142602,socialskills,reddit_comment,314,"The part where your friend defines what it means to be an adult is completely wrong in my opinion. Adults are allowed to be fun, act childish etc. and still take care of the ""adult"" stuff like hanging on to a job and a family. The only change that some young adults have to do is drink less (this applies to other drugs as well), because that affects your job/family. But enjoying life is still allowed when you are an adult. 

Regarding focusing on a partner instead of friends, it depends on what type of person he/she is and how much you are willing to compromise other friends for him/her. There are diminishing returns from a relationship if you have to put more in than you get out (I mean emotionally, of course) and it is completely up to you and how you feel.

Being a people pleaser myself, I know it is hard realizing that you can't please everyone. And after working in a team, and leading that team at times, I had to face the truth that it's simply impossible to please everyone. You have to accept that, and this applies in friendships as well, but in both cases make sure that you let that person know the full picture as to why you have to let them down. They will either understand or react badly, but that is out of your control. It is good to know the limits of what you can control, because there is no point wasting time and get anxious about different people who may not like you as much at the end of the day. And there will always be people talking crap about you, but be certain that as long as you are not an asshole to everyone, there will be people to defend you, or simply ignore what they're saying, knowing it's not true."
soc_600383,socialskills,reddit_comment,528,"Hey dude. I came from a similar situation as you (home schooled in a super strict, super christian house). I am 27 now. I know it can be rough out there... you don't even know how people just talk and get along. It can be so frustrating you just wanna scream! If you need a perspective from an ex-homeschooler, ex-fundamentalist woman, I am here. I am also here if you just need to talk or need support.

It took me a long time to get over the trauma from that (and it IS traumatizing, even if you have the nicest parents in the world, isolationist, fundamentalist, homeschooling like that is abusive!) and it was not easy. I'm still not 100% over it or 'normal' but I am far more content with it now. But that took time, and work, and healing. If you have the means to, see a therapist. I know that's pretty textbook advice, but it's good advice that a lot of folks ignore.

Getting 'out there' helps. I'm not saying go to a nightclub or something... I still hate those. Interest and hobby groups are a good starting point. But I personally found trying to seek out new and 'wild' experiences helped. They make you a more interesting person. I'm not talking about anything dangerous of course, but break the rules a little bit! Shut your mom off in your head and do things she wouldn't allow you to do! For me that's been relishing in the anime/games I always loved and wasn't allowed to watch, dyeing my hair pink, dressing a little more 'scandalously' (not super extreme or anything just wearing skirts above fingertip and showin' a lil boob), being a bisexual, getting really into camping or taking fun trips to places I wouldn't used to go. That sort of stuff is up to you and your boundaries, but doing that stuff helps you find joy as well as things to talk about and relate to. Don't feel afraid to travel and talk to strangers in the pub. Go on adventures!

I also found that being a homeschooler I used to not have a very good sense of fashion or self care. Working on that makes you easier to talk to in general, I think that's true of all genders. I'm not saying you need to be perfect, just do the best with what ya got. I'm a bit of a moon faced awkward chub myself but presentation of that body can make a huge difference.

Work on listening to others and forming relevant responses. This is one I am still working on so I'll spare you advice here, I'm sure there are responses that cover this one better.

But most of all, take care of you! You got out of that hell hole. You're a tough son of a bitch. Our experiences gave us moxie and strength few others can relate to or compare to. Use it! Embrace it!

soc_1524436,socialskills,reddit_comment,428,"Here is my thought! You may refer it, but not abide it!  


For friend A, I think you and her must be get along with her very well, because you and her made a almost 10-year long friendship, and she even will give you a friend meeting for you!  
So, I recognize she is still willing to be contact with you!  
When she still willing to contact with you, then she must be wanted to share something with you! Or she won't be making a friend-meeting schedule for you.  
I cannot know the detail of whether she is talking very initiative or just completely silence when you meet her.  
Sure, keep a distant with your friend is very important. But, if you don't kinda feel comfortable at the scene, then it'll become a very awkward situation. So, don't be awkward when you both meet! You may talk about what happen to you recently, or listen to her and try to find out the similarity between you and your friend A! We can try to be opened to other, but not too much! You can try to open a topic with everything, and find what she is her actually interest.  
Or you can ask how her had been recently! Then prolong the topic.  
You may also try to find a topic inside her conversation! And maybe trying to prolong the topic after she over.  
If you feeling awkward, then I will give my bless for you! Make you being brave enough to do it!  


As for friend B, I think you don't need to think too much about her. I assume she must just be shy to express her real self. If you can, you may try to seize the chance of asking her what she thinks about you.  
Yes, I guess everyone have a lot of things need to be dealt with in this world! Especially after we finished our college. However, if you think you cannot give up on friend A and B, then you may try to being more open or initiative to them.  


If we still cannot leave then, then don't be too sad about it.  
Because old ones gone, new one comes.  
There is nothing is permanent yet nothing is ending.  
After all, ending is another new start.

If, as you imply, you are chasing social status then your suggestion is clever but disingenuous. And using it on someone you hope to impress could backfire if they suspect you of gaming them.  If you really did want their favour you wouldn’t do either of these but instead would find out and remember their name through someone else.

It can be good if you focus on the element of having sex and doing it well.. like a competition where you're trying to do your best.. That could be a solid bet but it's not without risks. If it's illegal in your country, I advise you to not do it as that can end way worse than the default worst. I have not put the crazy focus on sex that some do. Sex is fun, finding a good person to have sex with is the quest but it can be a difficult one and it's up to you whether or not you opt out after a failure or two. I opted out.. Then again, I do find, not from experience though but through logic and reason, that intimacy along side with sex, between two people who are entangled in the chemical brain cluster-fuck known as love, is probably the best sex there is. That's like, what I can only assume, having really good sex while you're off your tits on drugs.. Like a double whammy, if you wish."
soc_1309915,socialskills,reddit_comment,309,"Smart doesn’t factor in at all. 
 
Demonstrably smart people are usually focused on a passion - a skill, area of study, hobby, etc. The way you meet them is by becoming a bit more of a joiner - say yes to all invitations, make time for your favorite sport, game, or other pastime. And, as you do this, you will be putting yourself around others who like those same things. And you’ll start noticing the other regulars, and then it’s up to you to reach out and make a friend. 
 
College is a pretty easy venue. And unlike high school, you don’t have to make all your friends in the first few weeks - 5 in a month ain’t bad. But BE a good friend to those five, and let their networks start to filter in - make friends with their friends, hang at the same library/bar/cafe/spot on the lawn as them. Go to their parties. 
 
Of course, the other main way to make friends is through your classes - either you are both forced to take some required lecture and can take turns taking notes or something… or you’re in a class you thought you might really like, amongst others who felt the same. Ideally, it IS fun and engaging, but even if it turns out to be a dud, you can commiserate with these classmates. Ask them what they did last weekend. Invite them out to that thing you’d never go to alone. 
 
But above all, stop acting like there are “smart” and “not smart” people. It’s ALL just people. Truly. They all have anxieties and confidences. Things they suck at. You are not unlike them, ALL of them. 
 
So, don’t focus on making just one kind of friend. Make friends with as many people in as many majors from as many places as you possibly can!"

But yeah autism and logisticians like INTJ/INTP share traits but no it doesn't mean you are on the spectrum AFAIK. But I don't really know enough about autism to say anything like that.

I do know that it's perfectly normal to be slightly autistic, like probably everyone has some degree of autistic traits. Once you've identified these traits you start to notice it more in public or with your friends. Especially once you see someone who is undeniably autistic.

For example, mew2king a smash brothers heavyweight, often streams on twitch and has many YouTube videos. Dude is pretty autistic. He shares a lot of similarities with my cousin. I also can identify with a lot of his thought processes myself. I'm probably a few percentage points autistic, but who's to say? It doesn't really matter in the end.

These toxic behaviors are also a symptom of something else going on (depression, anxiety, etc). You are not as bad as you are making yourself think you are.

soc_167576,socialskills,reddit_comment,373,"Eye contact is a huge hurdle for pretty much anyone with the slightest bit of social anxiety. I had a very hard time with it myself a few years ago at the height of my own anxiety but have slowly became more and more comfortable with it as my confidence has increased.

Walking down hallways and standing around waiting - you don't really need to be making eye contact unless there's going to be someone around who you know. For me, it is more important to be looking comfortable in the location: relaxed body language, calmly looking around to see what is happening. The only thing I really care about here is to ensure I am not stood with my head down, staring at the ground, or even worse, staring at my phone.

I would recommend you start focusing on eye contact with people you know well: family, friends, etc., to begin with. You can move on to people you are never going to see again - if it somehow goes badly you can write it off; they aren't going to remember you or what you have done, plus you'll not have to see them again.

The ""rules"", so to speak, are very loose because everyone is different and it is important you don't get hung up on these. 

When conversing with someone you do not need to be looking into their eyes continuously. The most important time to make eye contact is when you are speaking - in my opinion. If you have that eye-to-eye connection with the person you are talking to it ensures that they understand what you are saying is meant with sincerity. Saying something to someone while looking away usually conveys a sense of dishonesty to them, even if you don't mean it to.

Natural eye contact is something that happens through experience. It is normal to look away while recalling/thinking something, and it is equally normal to often break eye contact. 

So yeah, try more eye contact with people steadily. If you feel the need to break it do so smoothly and slowly, do not ""flinch"" and jerk your eyes away if you can help it. Also apologies if this is poorly written, it's pretty late here!"

twitter is also quite similar to instagram as well, you can find content you’re interested in and it’ll be easy to get used to using (also don’t bother getting into online arguments on twitter, they’re usually a waste of time lol)

Best of luck!"
soc_122379,socialskills,reddit_comment,248,"You can get a job, I'm pretty much in the same boat as you, but I got a job just by bullshitting my way through the interview. When they ask you what you have been doing just say focusing on school. 
I'm currently stuck at home with no job and a broken foot, and the wasted time thing I absolutely understand. The only advice I can offer you is basically what I tell myself, worrying about it only make it worse, you can choose to start living anytime you want it's up to you, even if that means reading a book you've been wanting to read, or going to see a movie, we just need to go out and make the effort. I don't know if this is the right thing for you or the smart thing to do but I plan to let my foot heal, get a job save for a few months, and go travel for as long as my funds allow me. I'm sick of being home, I'm sick of not having any cool stories of my own, I'm just sick of wasting my life. Hopefully by traveling I can give myself a crash course in life.
Fear is what holds us back, we allow fear to dictate our lives, you for the last seven year and me, pretty much my entire life, but I'm done and you sound like your done. There's nothing left for us to lose man, lets just start living."
soc_684835,socialskills,reddit_comment,154,"Do what you want man, although I assume you don't know what that is since you're on Reddit asking this question. I would say, go talk to the girl, try to become friends with anyone really, talk to them, see what their interests are and then you'd be able to find out what y'all got in common. Do you/they like roleplaying? If so then try Dungeons and Dragons, I've never played it, but it sounds fun. Do you like Science? Try to ask for a class together if possible so you can make friends and talk to people. All-in-all, it's your choice, you do what you want, but at the end of the day no one can make this decision except for you. Heck, if you're really unsure, flip a coin. If you get a result and think you should try again, the choice you wanted is on the opposite side of the coin."
soc_909333,socialskills,reddit_comment,600,"Dude you’re doing it right. I was nothing, nobody, most boring person in the world at your age. I worked my ass off and instead of partying it up and having adventures of idiocy in my 20s I get to do it in style middle aged. Who really has a better time? The idiot at 22 years old who gets black out drunk in the Netherlands, loses his passport, and has to call his mom cause he’s broke, or the guy who’s older, more responsible, doesn’t black out and do stupid shit, and has a lavish time with his wife cause he’s got money in the bank from making sound decisions his whole life? You’re not missing anything dude.

And as far as girls go, two things:

First, you’re gonna have to keep meeting and talking to people. This will happen on its own through school and work. You have no choice but to be who you are. Be anyone else, and people will see right through that shit, so just be who you are. Most people won’t like you, but that’s fine. It may not seem like it, but I swear to god nobody really likes anybody. However, some people WILL like you as long as they have the chance to see you and meet you. It’s probability man. Sooner or later you MUST meet someone who will dig you. It’s just math man. Tons of people hate me. Tons of people can’t stand me. Didn’t stop me from eventually marrying someone. If I can do it anyone can.

Second, you WILL be rejected. Everyone is. Again it’s just math. Even if people say crappy things to you, the worst thing you can do is take rejection personally. There is no such thing as “unlovable” or people being put together “right” or “wrong”. That’s all aesthetic bullshit invented in people’s minds. Turns out the world keeps turning whether you’re cool, or lame, or a supermodel, or a loser, or a serial killer, or a prom king, or whatever else. There’s gonna be lots of people who don’t like you. It’s normal. For everyone. Trust me on this. People don’t make meaningful real connections very easily at all. A lot of conditions have to be right for that, and that’s tough because everyone is different. Some people seem on the outside like everyone loves them and their life is perfect. It’s bullshit. Going on a spring break in Cancun and getting impregnated by some dude you don’t even know cause “omg he was so haaawwwwttt” is not a meaningful connection. It’s just retarded. The only thing that you’re different about is a lack of meaningless false connections. Most people don’t have real friends. I have 1, and honestly even he’s questionable.

When you finish school in a lot of ways the real world will probably be kinder to you. People’s priorities really change once they have to survive everyday and the world is kicking the shit out of them on a daily basis. You will find someone and your studies will allow you to have a much better shot at a good life than most people. If you’re really that serious about suicide, at least do this first: wait until you’ve been out in the real world away from school for 5-6 years. You haven’t experienced the real world yet. You have no way to imagine what life is really about yet. Ending it before it starts means that statistically you will probably be throwing away your best years, even if you had experienced all these overrated experiences you want."
soc_41561,socialskills,reddit_comment,228,"Separate it out.  A character flaw is not the person.

A person - a being - at his or her core, is a unit of free will, a maker of choices, surrounded by a bag of flesh and bones, and influenced by a variety of internal and external forces.

When I see somebody's character flaw flaunt itself, I feel bad for the person, and I have empathy for them.  It's not so much that the person is evil / bad / disgusting / whatever... but that their flaw is using them.  The person themselves may have (knowingly or unknowingly) *allowed* the flaw to use them... but that's not for me to judge.  That's not my job.

No, my job is to work on my own flaws.  I have many (and some of them, I can even see for myself!)

It helps me to think in shades of gray, instead of black and white.  Everybody - every person on this planet, from Hitler to the Dalai Lama, have (or did have) good and bad within them.  Each person has their own set of struggles.  If I'm tempted to judge somebody else for their failings, I simply remind myself of my own.  Then I look at that person, and see just that: another person, another human being, struggling up the same mountain of life, but taking a slightly different path."

I know it sucks to hear because it would be much easier if there was one thing to look out for, but everyone is different and will give different “signals” - honestly it sounds like OP is doing great at reading her body language/behaviour so they’ll probably know if anything seems to change a bit!"
soc_88460,socialskills,reddit_comment,172,"This has helped me quite a bit, though YMMV:

Work on being vulnerable, especially with people that you already feel comfortable opening up to.  It can be an incredibly attractive trait, because it takes a lot of courage.  What I have found is that it is scary as hell the first few times, and then it comes more easily.  And it helps immensely to build confidence.  And you can never come off as arrogant or cold if you are putting yourself out there.  In fact, it will help people feel safe opening up to you and your relationships will deepen.

You are talking about a defense mechanism, and one that I know very very well from using it for most of my life.  In my opinion, the way to change it is to address the root cause.  For me, a big cause of social anxiety was shame and the inability to be vulnerable with others.  If this rings true to you at all, check out this TED talk by Brene Brown.

soc_127341,socialskills,reddit_comment,244,"I'm going to assume you're in high school, since that's just the sort of vibe I'm getting. Apologies if I'm misreading.

First off, I wanted to advise against the sort of ""approval-seeking"" behavior you're displaying, as it's generally a turn-off for both sexes. What I'm referring to is asking if you can sit with her, as well as the tone in your post (""she actually remembered my name"").

Now on to your question:

Talk normally. Build upon what you've learned about her, and try to learn more. Share things about yourself that you haven't talked about yet. Talk about things that happened between lunch and the time you last talked. Discuss classes, schoolwork, etc, but be sure to quickly gauge her interest in such topics. Some people enjoy such things, but many (especially in high school) might not be so receptive to the actual topics. In that case, you can end the topic by having a semi bitch-fest about how so-and-so teacher is such a dick and gives out too much homework, then transition to the next topic.

Ideally, if you have the freedom and she is enthusiastic enough, try to get an outside of school date arranged. Since her friend will be there, you can ask if they want to go hang out at the mall, go bowling, play at an arcade/park (like celebration station), eat ice cream, play basketball, whatever you think she'd enjoy based on her interests and personality and availability."
soc_169930,socialskills,reddit_comment,163,"Standing up straight was definitely a big step in my battle with social inadequacy. Im 6""1 upright,  but used to (still sometimes do)  walk around hunched, dropping my height a good 3 or 4 inches. Now,  I walk Into a room and I feel a palpably different state of mind. I don't know if people even notice that im not stooped any more or if it's just me feeling more self assured and imposing,  but I make a significant effort to make my shoulders square and chest forward before entering a room, and I find the smiles and self confidence and therefore the conversation flow more easily. 

It sounds silly to write down, but genuinely was a beginning and a big step of my (unfinished and probably never ending) journey towards being happy in myself. 

I  also think that it doesn't matter how tall you actually are, just the difference in how you  carry yourself can make the difference.

soc_702406,socialskills,reddit_comment,210,"It depends on the college, but my experience in taking communication classes is you generally have to get up and give presentations in front of the group. So if you hate public speaking you are not going to enjoy the class.

It really depends on your major and what classes you are taking in how easy to meet people. I have had some classes where the professor just gave lectures (optional to attend), you showed up for exams and you turned in a paper. The classes where the professor mainly lectures the whole class it a little more difficult to meet some of the other people, since you are not doing much group work.  The only way to meet people in that class would be form a study group with the other students in the class. 

When I was taking my Japanese classes we had to practice our speaking with other students, so you got to interact with at least 2-3 different students each class. By the second term, I pretty much knew everybody's name in the class, since there were only 15 of us in the second term.

So what I can tell op is to also be kind to themselves. Even though you might have gone through a really hard time, i really, truly wish you to slowly let go of this past trauma and be able to find inner peace.

But there's ideas of success that don't require being talkative, like getting good grades, creating a circle of friends that you can trust (super undervalued in my opinion), being a good significant other. Lots of things.

That said, there are also alot of ""success criteria"" where being talkative helps you. Like having a exceptional career very often requires you to be able to talk well with people. Or having alot of connections, that requires talking to alot of people to.

So decide what your criteria for success are, then evaluate if that includes being super talkative. Successful doesn't have to look like those girls you admire. "

If I don't enjoy talking with someone, I just don't talk with him.

You felt bad yourself because you assumed that he was right. You thought that you are a boring person. Look, I'm not gonna say that is true or not. But you need to question yourself about this. Why did you feel very bad because someone thought that you are something?

It sounds like you think you are boring. If you think this, no one can stop you from becoming that. And I think boring people are unhappy people. They don't or can't enjoy the time they are having and naturally they get everyone bored around them.

soc_1824330,socialskills,reddit_comment,169,"So we have our interests, hobbies, and passions. Let's define them. Interests are subjects you enjoy learning about. Hobbies are things you like to do. And passions are interests and hobbies turbo-charged.

You asked, ""why do people feel guilty about sharing certain hobbies?"" My answer is, it depends on how well you know someone. What is more, if you're sharing your hobbies with someone new, I believe there would be a lack of emotional safety between you and another person. Emotional safety means that you're confident bringing up any sort of issues without the fear of being shutdown, ridiculed, or judged. 

More tellingly, I think it's very important to keep in mind that we should be authentic, honest, and true to ourselves when discovering our interests, hobbies, and passions. It's important to listen to your heart and follow your path in life. Do NOT let anyone else tell you who you should be or what you should do. Only you know what is best for you. All the best."

Exactly the kind of buzzword answer you get from tin-foil hats trying to explain the earth is flat. You are the one who tells me that I somehow don‘t value women unless I get into their pants 💀. You just repeat yourself all over again. Those „places“ don‘t exist besides what I‘ve said. The „I won‘t help people“ was a comparison to make your „you may be a threat“ look as insane as it is... 

Dating apps? Yeah, won‘t bother going into that shitshow. Not 6ft? No, thank you. I think paranoia is not normal at all. I think you don‘t realise how it is the be considered a ghost. Talk about „priviledge“. Nah, evil men have it soooo good. It‘s only *us* who are in a bad position. Speed dating? I don‘t live in a city. Most people here are families or old. The rest are the usual drunktards without any direction in life besides „let‘s party and drink“. 

I complain about not liking drunktard parties with loud music because it‘s meaningless and no „real“ conversation is happening? Damn. You don‘t like that lifestyle? Die alone! 

No one is asking for it to shape it my way. I am asking you where those places are and that any place is now considered a no-go. Nice, not like Tinder is mostly for hookups anyways. All you did so far is repeat yourself, spin a narrative and throw assumptions out. 

Where are those settings exactly? Since I‘m a rapist if I open my mouth. God-forbid I am a living threat to you because I breathe and am male. I should KMS it seems. Since I‘m so dangerous. Just say „leave everyone of us alone“. Because that‘s how it is to be priviledged in being the one who has to put 0 effort into it. You try your best to comply and all you get back is the same meaningless gibberish. Talk about being priviledged lmao.

You also added another „for a possibility of sex“. Yeah, it‘s totally *me* who is so fixated on sex. That‘s why I mentioned this being my intention, not genuinly knowing someone, nah, just SEEEEEX.

Honestly, you disgust me. How everyone who wants to have a relationship is immediatly seen as „I WANT SEEEEEX“. Sorry to make it up to you, but a relationship is so much more than sex. If all I wanted was sex, I can just go into a club and have x amount of ONS. You act like a toddler thinking that people look for a relationship for sex. Now you make people feel bad for wanting a relationship (which in your reality, is all about getting in their pants). Damn, you need to move in, perhaps manage a household and much more for sex? You wouldn‘t just have flings if all you wanted is sex? Pff! Perhaps stop the misandrist view of all men who want a RS to be evil. The world treats people bad enough. But nah, gotta stomp on them.

How does that happen, you ask? By being yourself with others, by speaking your mind when you have something to say, by never shying away from something, and most importantly, by never being afraid to stand your ground and do all of the above, even if no one agrees with you at first, or if you think you sound stupid, or whatever makes you NOT want to speak your mind.

 **Dear Fanny**

 **It is with deep grief that I learn of the death of your kind and  brave Father; and, especially, that it is affecting your young  heart beyond what is common in such cases. In this sad world of  ours, sorrow comes to all; and, to the young, it comes with  bitterest agony, because it takes them unawares. The older have  learned to ever expect it. I am anxious to afford some alleviation  of your present distress. Perfect relief is not possible, except  with time. You can not now realize that you will ever feel better.  Is not this so? And yet it is a mistake. You are sure to be happy  again. To know this, which is certainly true, will make you some  less miserable now. I have had experience enough to know what  I say; and you need only to believe it, to feel better at once.  The memory of your dear Father, instead of an agony, will yet be  a sad sweet feeling in your heart, of a purer and holier sort  than you have known before.**

 **Please present my kind regards to your afflicted mother.**

 **Your sincere friend**  
 **A. Lincoln**

I hope I helped ease your pain even if just a tiny bit. I advice you to call suicide hot line. These are trained people that deal with people that are going through what you're going through, every day. They can help you better that I can even understand, not being a trained professional myself.

I think the biggest thing isn’t what you say, but it’s the circumstance you say it in. There are things you definitely shouldn’t approach a girl with, for example, “you’re sexy”, this is terrifying when you’re alone, but is just weird/creepy at a bar with friend. Still shouldn’t say it, but there are much better openers. Even if a guy approached me saying “Hey you seem interesting” while I’m walking alone, I would feel a bit creeped out/nervous. the circumstance is rly important.

If she does hurt you, it’s going to hurt regardless of whether or not you saw it coming.

Do remember that you’re competing with Japan for her attention. Japan is going to win. It sounds like she’s on a dream vacation so it’s supposed to be that way! It means nothing about you.

But the way you handle it says everything about you. So try to chill and distract yourself with something else for the time being.

Imagine you are at a party and someone walks up to you and just starts telling you things. Probably not that exciting. Maybe a little interesting, potentially... but compare that to someone that approaches you and seems genuinely interested in you and in what YOU have to say. Asks you how your day was, or how you feel about rollercoasters in a way that makes you feel like they really want to know what you think.

Once you get the ball rolling, you'll find yourself with a lot more to talk about. You can tell a similar story or relate something relevant. This is how genuine conversations are born. It's a subtle shift, and counterintuitive, but by being interested and asking questions, you'll stop feeling this way as much."
soc_840406,socialskills,reddit_comment,1101,"Hi. If you are a regular reader of r/socialskills you will realize you are not alone in your concern about making conversation in social situations. You share this commmon concern with lots of people... and it is a concern that you will turnaround! 

Most of us at some point in our lives find ourselves at a loss for words in a social situation. It's real common and nothing to be concerned about.

You raise a very interesting point about finding it harder to make new friends as an adult. It can be both easier and harder depending upon circumstances. (I know that sounds like a statement that doesn't help at all:)

Let me explain. I see your question as having two parts. If I interpret it incorrectly please let me know.

1. Finding and making new friends as an adult.
2. Concern about making and keeping conversations going.

There is a 3rd element which I will address first. You say "" I always feel like I have no real intellect to contribute."" Don't confuse not having something to say with not having intellect. They are not the same things.

All of us process information at different speeds and at different times and in different situations. When we are anxious in a social situation it's often hard to contribute  or participate. Sometimes we are so focused on thinking about what we should say that we lose the thread of the conversation. Believe me when I tell you that time is the great healer. The more conversations in which you participate (even if you are on the sidelines and not speaking,) ultimately you will find thoughts coming to mind and very naturally finding there way into the conversation. I can tell you this from personal experience!

Regarding finding friends as an adult... it's a bit different than when we are students. Usually students have different groups. clubs, activities, etc. and it's pretty easy to join them. (Not always, but usually.) I had a real popularity problem in HS and it virtually disappeared when I entered the working world. Not that I suddenly had a group of friends, but the unpopularity virtually vanished:))

As adults it's not always easy to simply find a group. I'm pretty sure you've heard people give you the advice: ""Join a group that has your special interests and you'll meet people."" Certainly that's true to a certain extent. For example if you play chess or tennis you can always find people to play with. But sometimes it's hard to figure where to start.

One question I would have for you is if you are referring to groups at work or when not working. I don't know where you are located. But one great way to meet people is MeetUp. Most areas in the country have them. If you are in a large city you will find more groups than you could ever join. For example, in NYC there's groups like ""Drinking with Strangers"" and ""I want to do that just not alone."" And then of course there are groups for virtually any interest you might have.

You can even try doing an internet search putting in your interest and the city. Just as an example: [I just Googled Meetup Groups in NYC and here are the results.](https://www.meetup.com/topics/nyc/)  Check out the link just as an example as it will give you ideas. Then if the mood hits you try putting in your city.

I can't really comment on groups at work as I don't know what you do, the size of your company, etc. I've been self employed since before you were born and that's really difficult for meeting groups of people at work. I almost never see my clients, so I have to turn outside to Meetup and recommendations from friends and other ways.

Part two of your question is concern about making and keeping conversations going. It's very different if you are talking about a general group or with someone you want to date:)

I'll assume you are referring to groups. (I'm a life coach and I write a lot about dating. If there is interest I will post some of what I write.)

It's very natural to be concerned about participating in conversations. Sometimes we see other people who seem to always have something to say and are never at a loss for words. There are people like that.

There are just as many people who are self-conscious in groups and worry about what to say and how to get into the conversation.

The reality is, (this is just my opinion) is if there are groups around, and you are in them either directly or on the sidelines... don't even think about participating. Focus on the conversation and try to listen and really hear what is being said. Don't concentrate on how you can participate.

If you really listen closely to people, at some point a thought is going to pop into your head. When it does, do your best to wait for a pause in the conversation and then make your statement.

You may find this hard at first. You may have the idea but are uncomfortable interjecting it. That's also real common and no big deal. While it can be frustrating to have something to say and not get a chance to say it... I can virtually guarantee you (and this comes from more years of living and experience than I care to admit to:))) that eventually you will find a time... when you are not trying to hard, that you will share your idea or thought, And the more you do this the easier it becomes.

I'm not trying to make things sound like they are super easy. Just follow the instructions and everything will change. But I do believe that what I've written above does really work and I hope it's helpful. I'm sure lots of people will give you lots of advice.

My only real advice is simply, don't worry about conversation... it will come!

For the finding groups to participate in you have to take a little more action and really look.

Finally, if you were talking about not knowing what to say in a dating type situation let me know and I'll address that. I have all sorts of stories good and disasters that I can tell:)

You wrote a very clear post and obviously you are a good communicator. I predict that the concerns you mentioned are ones that you can address and you will make real positive progress.

I wish you a lot of luck. Take care. Dave"
soc_404618,socialskills,reddit_comment,286,"It's not a big deal. Shit happens and you move on. No one is gonna remember it anyways. It's up to you if you want to self reflect on a situation if you're the type to overthink.

I'm just voicing my opinion from your story. It's annoying to play people who arbitrarily break the rules. Were other people overhead pitching too without complaints? You aren't above the rules.

It also doesn't feel good when someone else shows favoritism no matter how justified. You could have handled it a different way. You literally could've pitched normally then when the baseball guys came up, told them: ""hey I'm switching to overhead cause you're on the baseball team, alright!?""

You acknowledge they are good, they know you know it and will probably say ok. 

No one knows what you're thinking. Maybe it's fine and no big deal, but I think it peeved some people, so was the big guy just being a douche or was he annoyed by you? Usually, there's plenty of blame to go around.

You can totally dismiss what I said and think your right or adjust your behavior for next time. People will forget this ever happened anyways.

&gt; Wasn’t like I was throwing heat.

Maybe some people thought you were by switching to overhand.

&gt; I was just simply switching from underhand to overhand, making it a tiny bit faster. 

I still don't see how this justifies breaking the rules. Throw harder if you want it a tiny bit faster. I'm short, so should I stand in the court to serve the ball? It seems only fair. What's the big deal, he's on the tennis team and 6' tall, so he can handle it."
soc_399905,socialskills,reddit_comment,283,"What you need to focus on is the fact that socializing is draining for you and why. It should be fun and revitalizing to be around a friend.

For me it was/is because the entire time I socialize I judge myself harshly. More harshly than others. So by the end of a couple hours of hanging out I'm just pooped from all the mental energy it takes to pick apart every move I make in front of someone else and figure out what the better move might have been.

I'm trying to learn to be more relaxed and in the moment rather than so caught up in my head. 

If this kinda sounds like you then I've found meditation helps me focus. I'm not great at it and I don't remember to do it every day. The days I do remember, however, I feel a lot less anxiety. Also when I'm on top of my shit like clean habitat, work, commitments, etc. I feel much less social anxiety. You'd be surprised at how much those worries are communicated in your body language and even shows in how you speak to others.

My suggestion to you is just to find a way to relax and have fun while socializing. Be in the moment, really listen to other people, experience emotions as they come and go. If you judge yourself then judge yourself and move on. If you're worried about school/work/anything just note it for later and move on. Don't dwell on one thought. It's a waste of mental energy. 

You can avoid this by actively seeking better thoughts. Positive ones that reinforce your behavior with your core values in mind.

Just my two cents."
soc_677300,socialskills,reddit_comment,247,"Ok listen carefully pinapple\_pizza here is the tactic to getting a girlfriend in highschool. Because your not 18 yet we can't use tinder so hop on your snapchat and add a bunch of chicks from your recommended friends, make sure there same age and go to different high schools preferably 3 different chicks. Now wait some time and send them all an ""accidental streak"" with half your face in it something like that, when they reply don't kill the convo, chat em up the whole night end on a good note. Now do a massive pull back, no snap chats to them for 1 week make sure your putting yourself on your story doing fun stuff with friends. While you are doing this 1 week pullback your not waiting around hoping it works you repeat the process with a new set of girls keep the cycle happening. After the 1 week pullback text them all back saying you where busy that week and wanted to catch up, and end the conversation by asking them if they wanted to do something Friday after school since you had nothing planned, if she tries to reschedule or change the day, say you can only do Friday after school don't budge, this part is crucial. Now that you have a date every Friday the rest is up to you. This tactic is legendary the success rate is insane. I've recently graduated so im passing this one down to you, good luck."
soc_314954,socialskills,reddit_comment,296,"Well, most people don't initiate conversations because they either find text conversations tedious or they don't have the energy for socialising after a long day etc. You are the centre of your universe, he is the centre of his universe. He doesn't think about you much, or about anyone else for that matter. But that doesn't mean he *dislikes* you, see? It's not personal. 

I'm also very emotionally sensitive and used to worry about these things too, but from experience, I've learnt that 90% of the time (when looking back in hindsight) that I had read between the lines too much and saw things that weren't there. Honest to god, it isn't personal. For instance, my best friend ignored me for 2 months - but it just turned out he was busy. It was still rude from my perspective, yes, but most people just aren't a [highly sensitive person](http://hsperson.com/) - they just let things slide without thinking about it. But he got back in touch and our bond is still as great as it ever was. Most people just don't give a shit like we do - which is why ***it's up to you*** to take the initiative. But stay true to yourself, and be your amazing self that genuinely cares about others :) It's much more rewarding in the long term :)

The only way you can *really* know is if you ask him out in person and 1) see how he responds 2) and if he says yes, then see how he acts with you in real life. I'm not just being positive for the sake of it, I just think (from my similar experiences) that you're too quick to jump to negative conclusions.

Please. Realise this. It will change your life. Promise :)"
soc_943980,socialskills,reddit_comment,370,"&gt; What do others have to adapt to just because I'm quiet

They have to adapt to the fact that you have a whole different view on being quiet than they do.

If you are quiet in a social setting where people are expected to be social, the general assumption you are quiet is because of reasons like:

\- you're not enjoying yourself  
\- you don't feel included  
\- you don't want to be here  
\- you don't like these people  
\- you don't think the conversation is interesting

Those assumptions are probably wrong if you're just quiet because... you are. 

They ask ""why are you so quiet"" is also to make sure it's NOT those things.

But if your reply to that question is ""shut up for one second so I can talk"", then you're reaffirming those assumptions they have. Personally, I don't find that a good thing.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; You're doing that insinuation. My only take away was that when it comes to people criticizing your character, you should be assertive.  

Even if it's unintentional that you insinuated that, it's easily interpreted that way, and easily seen as something rude... failure on your part to account for that potential misinterpretation is exactly also why you can not assume people are rude when they ask you why you are quiet.

And as for the actual statement... what about character traits that are bad? For example if someone is a toxic asshole, and people tell that person they are a toxic asshole, then it's definitely an attack on their character. It would be wrong of that person to respond with a general attitude of ""shut up you have no right to criticize my character"", right? Even if they are convinced their character is just fine, it's not.

Now what happens if someone thinks that being quiet is not exactly a friendly, helpful, positive character trait? Maybe the thought of those assumptions I mentioned above are correct makes them incredibly anxious, which is why they ask that question?

Then it's up to you to create understanding that you don't mean it that way. That you are aware you have a different mindset and you're just quiet because that's who you are."
soc_343526,socialskills,reddit_comment,197,"In my opinion, honesty is a good thing, and more and more people these days can get so easily offended. Obviously, you care about not coming across to people as an asshole, but over time you'll probably develop more tact. I think the world needs more honest people, and if you stay true to yourself the people in your life who stay will appreciate you being genuine because you will be trustworthy, and the people who just want you to act in ways that make THEM feel good won't stick around. From your example, you did have a point that you were listening to your music first, you were correct (in my opinion) that because the other guy CHOOSE to come up to you and try to start a conversation WHILE you were doing something else and assume that you'd give him your undivided attention - well that's HIS problem. (Again, in my opinion.) If you want advice on social tact, what I would do is search for ""best books on social tact"" or something similar on Amazon and get tips from the pros. Or, search Google for blog posts, articles, etc., or for videos on YouTube."

I think that the ability to be alone is more commendable than people who are constantly in relationships. Take the time that you have alone to get to know who you are more and how you can be a better you. Once your mind is on focusing on bettering yourself and radiating positivity, you will automatically attract girls.

soc_161764,socialskills,reddit_comment,290,"You sound like a more socially adept me in highschool. My role in highschool was the perpetual acquaintance. Everyone liked me, just I had trouble getting close to people or hanging out with them. Also, Lupe's new album is awesome. 

First of all, join a club. Join many clubs. Clubs are fun. I think every comment I've made on this sub I've mentioned clubs like a cliche. But really that is what helped me get up through highschool. You're in this environment where you have common interests with people and will be spending time with them outside of class to work on something ( a robot, a play, a skill, etc.) on a regular basis. Swag. It facilitates working with others and getting to know them. I joined the school play and man did it help me get out of my shell (and a girlfriend). If you do something with other people where you have to work with them, you develop this camaraderie with them and that shit makes you feel a part of something. It's really nice and it makes it easier to develop deeper relationships with people when you interact with them outside of the traditional classroom setting. And you have something to talk about. I did Drama, robotics, trivia, and tennis in highschool. I started it all late junior year, and my only regret is not joining them earlier. It certainly made doing homework harder, but hey you have time. Highschool is easy.

College on the other hand is hard. So fucking hard. Academically that is, socially it's way easier. At least for me.

soc_166775,socialskills,reddit_comment,640,"Hello. 

As a side note it's fun being the first commenter on posts like this because I feel the first few posts are usually probably the most impactful.

I have somewhat of the same problem where it feels awkward to sit down with a group of people I may not know well. Double awkward because I only speak English and living in Germany right now :D

For me 1 on 1 conversations are much easier because I don't feel rude for expecting them to speak English to me. But in a group Germans fall back into speaking Deutsch and so I can lose the thread of the conversation and feel excluded.

I also do the same thing you do. Casing the joint. Walking in seeing who's talking to who, who's sitting where and If I feel comfortable entering into any of those conversations / situations.

From what I can tell you're looking for a way to extend your conversations and probably onto more meaningful topics. For me the best way I've found to keep conversations alive is through asking questions. The only thing you need to keep in mind is to adjust your questions to the current topic and make them specific. 

I don't know you well, Really I know nothing about you more than this post. But even from this an entire conversation can be spawned if I pick out details about what you have said and ask you to elaborate or explain what you mean. It increases my understanding of what you were trying to explain and it extends the conversation longer so that new questions can be formed.

I find as you ask more questions and find out about the person they will start to share information you don't ask for. Sometimes the new information is interesting but a complete tangent to the conversation your having and it is your choice to comment on what they said or let it go by.

It is important to remember a few things about the question mode. try to avoid simple questions that only require yes / no answers. Try to gauge how interested the person is in the subjects you are talking about. I.e they are very animated and lively explaining something to you compared with distracted and quiet. People enjoy talking about themselves, they enjoy it even more when someone is interested in who they are but quite rightly people aren't willing to share everything about themselves so learning to read when someone is uncomfortable talking about something will steer the conversations away from an untimely demise.

About awkward silences. This is a belief. It is an idea that not talking is awkward. Silence is a natural occurrence in a conversation and should be thought of as a good thing. It happens when one party is listening the other is talking and the talker finishes and the listener doesn't respond. Why they don't respond could be any number of reasons. From them still considering what you said, to them not listening and being unable to enter back into the conversation. If they're your friend it's probably not the latter so just take the moment of silence to look around, consider what you said or they said and then when you feel the natural occurrence of wanting to speak then carry on. Feeling awkward about silences means you try to remove them which means you will never learn to be comfortable with silences.

Take home points. Ask questions. Get specific. Be interested. Listen. Learn to think of silences as positive not negative. Put yourself out there, You can't meet people with meeting new people. When in a conversation remember family, friends, occupation, goals / dreams all easy topics to start to learn about them and get a fuller picture of the person who you're talking to.

Hope this helps."
soc_794820,socialskills,reddit_comment,170,"I'm guessing OP is an ethnic minority, hence his apprehension about not being accepted by women of other races. That your race can be a detriment in dating and particularly online dating apps is unfortunately a reality that not everyone realizes unless they're put in that situation.

It's not so much about being cynical or not. I just think that the best strategy for giving advice on a social skills forum that is both effective and motivational is to assume that the OP is a reliable narrator with good intentions. Namely, the sole intention to better himself or herself socially.

A huge reason why many people in this situation feel anxious is because they assume that others judge them for little or no reason. The goal is to reverse that mindset by convincing them that ""no one is a bigger critic than you are of yourself."" If we were to make unfounded assumptions about their motivations then that would only feed into their cycle of insecurity. Just my two cents."
soc_1752168,socialskills,reddit_comment,167,"Don't think about people, think about what things You enjoy. Find a hobby, join a club, take up a fun sport, volunteer somewhere...

If you're enjoying yourself you are more relaxed and your interactions with people become more natural.

soc_1464707,socialskills,reddit_comment,448,"I think there is a balance. Naturally some people have a more outgoing and enthusiastic personality, and some are more quiet and introverted. Neither is right or wrong. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. Outgoing extroverts have an advantage when it comes to making an impression because they naturally arouse excitement in others. But if they’re not careful, they can come across as loud, annoying, and attention-seeking. Introverts come across as well behaved and dignified. They don’t cause chaos by trying to be the life of the party. But if they aren’t careful, they come across as standoffish, judgmental, and rude to people who don’t know them or understand the nature of introverts. 

The key to making a good impression is striking a balance. Use the niceties such as saying hello, shaking hands, manners such as saying please and thank you, looking them in the eye when they talk. Those are the bare minimum. If you want to take it to the next level, ask them questions that indicate interest, pay them genuine compliments, and laugh if they tell a good joke. One last thing, and arguably the most important…confidence. Confidence is key. Stand up straight, I already said look them in the eye, and don’t be afraid to tell about your accomplishments if they ask, but keep it brief so you’re not bragging. 

Make sure the exchange is reciprocal. That’s the key to keeping people engaged and making a lasting impression. A good conversation is like a tennis match where both people feel like they’re on equal playing ground. They both have a chance at the gold, and the game is enough of a challenge. If you’re a loud outgoing extrovert who never lets the other get a word in, you’re that show-off tennis player who’s constantly spiking the ball. If you’re too quiet and not contributing to the conversation, then you’re like the player who isn’t even making an effort and is just missing every ball that gets hit their way. Not challenging enough. 

One last thing, the other person’s self-esteem is not your responsibility. It is their responsibility to pull their own weight in a conversation like a tennis match. If they need someone else to uplift them and make them feel good, then they have issues they need to work out. Now, if you suspect that something is wrong, like they are depressed or gong through something, then checking in and trying to help us always good. However, if you are a loud, outgoing, overly enthusiastic person who expects everyone to return that same level of enthusiasm in every interaction, then you are self-centered and narcissistic, and that’s something you need to work on."

soc_483656,socialskills,reddit_comment,804,"&gt;This is a perfect example of why its a bad idea to go into a discussion just expecting the other guy to wholesale accept and praise you for being right. You tend to disregard what the other guy says, missunderstand it, and then be no better off at the end of it.

Speak for yourself. Everything that you've said here fits in exactly to what you did. I'm surprised that you don't have any awareness about it at all.

&gt;Because if you're right, then you're the same fool that started the discussion. You've probably also alienated the other guy with your shenanigans as you attempt to ignore parts of his arguments for your own convenience. If you're wrong, you've robbed yourself of improving your understanding of it, and then becoming slightly less of a fool. 

Yes. That's a valid point. I'm not saying ""do this all the time"". I've also mentioned this in another thread over here. If you do this all the time you'll quickly get labeled as an asshole.

Also, I've been on your end of this discussion before with a friend who used to do this. I've seen both sides of this thing.

&gt;I've told you what I agree about, what I dont, and why I dont. What you do with that is up to you.

Nope. I got a sense of anger in your earlier post and somehow it was off-putting for me. 

&gt;But it was interesting to hear your thoughts.  I do not agree with truth relativism, your most topics dont have a clear truth statement, one bit since you are confusing the concept of truth with the concept of understanding. Objective truths clearly exist, otherwise our world would fall apart at the seams, but having a philosophical discussion on knowledge would take weeks of discussions. First I'd have to get a grasp of what your understanding of it is. Then I'd have to go get the sources, you too. Then we have to both engage those honestly for weeks on end. Maybe at the end we will both have a slightly better understanding of it but it is not something I can afford right now.

We don't need to do all that. I like the whole idea that you've put up over here. But all that we need to do is to discuss openly and ask whatever questions are required. Sooner or later we'll get to a clearer conclusive statement.

&gt;But sharing and comparing understandings is something you can always do. Just be careful of people that are doing it dishonestly. You should stop trying as soon as they start pulling shenaningans if you value the relationship. Because they will get angry and burn the relationship to the ground in a vain attempt to be ""right"" and damn the consequences.

Yes. I agree fully. I've already experienced this earlier in my life so I know what you're saying. Thank you for sharing your experience too. 

&gt;They'll ignore what you say and reply something like this: 
&gt;&gt; Fine. Ignore the advice then.

Nope. The guys that do what I suggested to do will never tell you ignore the advice. They're going to go down arguing with you until the very end. They will never think that an argument isn't worth it and give up.

&gt;I'm sure you can see how this can alienate people if you go into discussions trying to be right all the time. Other people will simply stop trying to engage you. That is how you rob yourself of the opportunity to improve your understanding on important things with the help of your social network.

Except you don't do it all the time. You are honest most of the time and every now and then you do this so that your acquaintance respects you. Again, this is what I've seen from my experience. If you ask me to explain something or disagree with something then that's okay. I just don't want to get into something if I foresee that it will end up in personal attacks and insults.

&gt;If you paid any attention to what I wrote then you'd know that I didnt ignore your advice. I took it seriously and made an honest reply on it. You've written what you are doing. 

Hmm.. I agree. You are considering it, no doubt. I'm not in my desktop browser right now so it's a little difficult for me to go back and look at your previous comment. But I had something sensed anger over there and decided not to continue talking about it.

Anyway, if you're still up for discussing it, then consider doing it a little bit in your interactions and see the results. Do it like 10-20% of the times and be your honest self the remaining times (to whatever extent you can be honest). "
soc_449651,socialskills,reddit_comment,280,"It comes down to self reflection. The only person who can answer your question is yourself. You can have a bunch of internet strangers or even a trusted friend give you the hard truth but you may not accept it unless you come to the conclusion yourself. 

What red flags do you think are there? Were you clingy or obsessive with the other person? Did you put too much into the possible relationship when the other person obviously wasn't having it? Do you perhaps focus too much on yourself (ie am I going to get rejected or not) vs genuinely getting to know the other person? Only you know these answers. 

Be honest, brutally honest with yourself. This is not an answer you can come up with just by asking someone.

As for lack of chemistry and ugliness... these are unfortunate truths that exist and are unpleasant to deal with. Believe it or not, you can fix ""ugliness"" through sheer will... stand up straighter, dress nicer, and take things in stride. Confidence, even faux confidence, is attractive, no matter how physically ""ugly"" you are. This is of course not to be confused with cockiness; overconfidence and boasting about how great you are compared to everyone else has pretty much the opposite effect. 

At the end of the day, if you find yourself frustrated and even fearful of rejection because you want a date so badly, it may be a sign that you simply aren't ready for a relationship. Take some time to be comfortable with yourself. Then you'll find yourself able to be comfortable around others, which is pretty much one of the most attractive features a person can have. "

Instead of telling her directly that you don't want to take the break at her suggested time, you come here and write a long post about it !

If you tell her she might not like it, which is probably what you fear, but then you can't go around pleasing everyone in your workplace !

And frankly no one can really suggest you anything other than making your choice of time clear to her, and confront her about things that you don't approve of and if she is being smartass about it , other people in your office will side with you not her, and if she is right you will learn something.

I had some normal friends or so i thought with a lot of them. Maybe its just my experience but the whole quality over quantity thing comes into play. I truly chill with or talk to maybe 2 people i went to highschool with. I dont wanna say fuck everybody because you wont ever see them again after highschool but thats my experience. And it turns out the one person i still really hang out with from highschool has speech problems but hes the only positive friend i have. Everyone else was either entitled from well off families and didnt know shit about life for people from different backgrounds from them so we didnt relate. And the people from that similar background were snakes, thieves and worse. So my only advice is anyone who treats you good, hold onto those people. Whether its 1 person or what. Thats life sometimes. We weren't all born into perfect families with money or without problems that make us different from the majority. People judge and dismiss in school. Fuck em.

soc_1604619,socialskills,reddit_comment,166,"I think when people call you a chill person, it's a compliment because it means you're nice to be around. I don't think that's something you necessarily need to change, it sounds like it's a trait people like about you.

When people say you're a private person, it usually means that person wants to know more about you. It's up to you whether or not to share more with that person. I had people in my life when I was younger who would say that to me to pressure me to tell them more about my life, and tbh, I don't think those are necessarily the people you want to share with. It's a nosey comment, basically. 

That being said, you don't want to be too private a person, you want to have at least one person in your inner circle, but they usually won't pressure you to share more about yourself.

soc_765189,socialskills,reddit_comment,174,"Spend some time alone with yourself! Only through isolation will we find individualization. 

I was the same way, especially with the last bullet. Meditate, have meals alone, enjoy and embrace the deafening silence. Observe your thoughts, for they are not good or bad. Good and bad are just labels we put on our thoughts. You are the presence behind your thoughts, the voice in your head that doesn't speak, but rather the one you feel. I hope this is making sense, because it took me a little while to grasp this concept. 

But when you meditate, allow monkey mind to take over. It will gravitate in a direction for a reason, it's up to you to figure out why. This will really help you not only to know yourself better, but to make changes to areas in your life you aren't happy with.

Hope this helps man, I was on the same boat not too long ago. Keep pushing, you're going to fail ALOT but that's okay. Failures are simply stepping stones to success."
soc_1364632,socialskills,reddit_comment,459,"It seems like your post is less about having friends and more about finding a girlfriend. 

The biggest thing, is you HAVE to stop thinking in terms of traits. That’s not how dating works. No girl is out there thinking about penis size or what scale men are perceived as on looks. Interest in people is subjective. Incels tend to gravitate towards these concepts as easy ways to shift the blame from themselves and their personality/mentality towards women onto some exterior thing they can’t control in order to play the victim. Just cuz one girl talked about a deep voice doesn’t mean that’s all any girls are looking for. And circumcision wasn’t your choice and there’s nothing you can do about it, so it’s best to just let that go (again, shifting blame to parents for making that choice for you). You can only do what you can with what you’ve got.

Relationships happen when people have shared interests and goals and develop an emotional connection. Yes, often physical attractiveness is an initial factor in dating but if you want a relationship that lasts, it’s all about compatibility. So you really need to get those thoughts about traits outta your head. It will get you nowhere, and women will be immediately turned off by that kind of mindset. 

One of the most important things to do, especially for those with ASD (I’m an SLP who works with kids/adults on the spectrum every day), is that you have to really pay attention to people. If you’re in a conversation or a social situation, you have to listen and learn about the people you interact with. Work at not shifting topics, etc. 

Also it is important to not have expectations. If you go in with the plan that I want to date this girl, and you go into each interaction with that goal, you’re going to likely push them away. Again in most situations that won’t get you anywhere. 

Relationships/friendships are two-way streets. You have to show interest in other people’s lives. In turn, if they want to get to know you, they should show interest in your life. 

There’s so much to consider, it is very overwhelming. I know, I see it every day. But above all else, you have to learn to be happy with yourself before you can be happy with another person. Relationships aren’t there to fix people (that’s codependency and it’s not good), they are partnerships where both are equals. 

Sounds like you’re taking good first steps to helping yourself. Therapy is that step but you have to be open, honest, and willing to change if you want therapy to work. Therapists can only give you tools, what you do with them is up to you."

If she just can’t see it then thank her for her input but close down the conversation and refuse to discuss it further.

Lots of people around you (socially normal ones) , they cant face with their own problems (fears, the reason of scare). If you are scared from sea, and if i pull you inside to swim, would you like to come with me ? You probably couldnt because you are scared from sea. That is similar. You are facing your own problem ofc it wont be easy and you ll give up early and decide not to socialize (or not to go inside the sea in the example). In any attemp of socializing just remind yourself that how brave you re. Believe me you really are. 

You think people are running away. This could be true, but it also might not be. Because if they didnt tell you openly what you re doing is 'fortune telling' and it will most probably lead you the wrong thoughts. But if you re so sure about it, analize what happens. For example if you talk about %100 negative things, people dont wanna listen you (and thats normal). Also if you see only bad things about the people you talk, they are right to runnig away. Who wants to be friend with someone that will think bad things about you ? No one.i  mean it could be lots of reason if people running away. Fixing the problem is totally up to you.

It has less to do with how you subtly manipulate the conversation into success, and more to do with what you genuinely want and what they genuinely want. Your way will get the most girls, my way will get you a meaningful relationship. A lot of guys lack any romantic self awareness, that’s what a lot of girls want.

So if the guy wants a hook up, by all means become a fuck boi and “learn the art of hooking up”. If he wants an actual relationship he should probably set his bar higher than the girl who’s favorite drink is cum. I swear some guys will go their whole lives dating that kind of girl oblivious to their completely low standards. Set yourself up for success by finding the most compatible person. Like you would get this girl, I’d run away. Neither is wrong, but I’m going to have more fulfilling relationships if I don’t learn how to hook thots and instead learn how to be direct and genuine."

So you get to choose how your ""Higher power"" is defined. Because right now you are not doing so well and need some extra help. WHo do you call on for assistance in decision making? WHo is you ""Phone a friend"" Maybe it is your dog that you had as a child who always was happy to see you. So you can ask that dog ""Maybe they won't like me, should I go out tonight?"" and of course your childhood dog will answer ""You are the greatest person ever, go have fun""

Or maybe your ""Higher power"" is your cat. You ask your cat for help in making a decision . they answer. ""Don't worry about it, lets go fuck shit up"" Maybe don't ask the cat they are sociopaths.

Or Maybe your higher power is You when you were in the sixth grade and were really on top of things for a little while.

That's why I mentioned the therapy. It gives you a controlled environment to work through your shit with someone who is trained to help you. It's still scary, but one on one with a pro can be much more manageable. If you are in school, (highschool or college?) you can talk to counsellors there for free, and they can at least help you find resources. (If you're not you can PM me if you like, and I can help you find some resources in your area)

I waited until my 30's (I'm 40 now) and the thing that I learned the most is that no one can save you from yourself. The cavalry isn't coming. If your life is going to get better it's up to you to drag yourself (mentally anyway) to a place where you can get help. This isn't to say ""Suck it up"", but more like understanding that you've been shot and there's no one around to help you, so it's up to you, hands shaking and bloody, to call the ambulance. 

My final warning will be to imagine feeling this way for decades. Not doing anything is going to lead to that and from my own experience it only gets worse with time. My own life didn't get better until I had lost enough pride to admit I needed help (which took a suicide attempt for me), and at this point I feel like I've lost 20 years of my life and nothing in the world can give me back that time. I may have to accept that I'm going to be largely alone for the rest of my life, and that I'm always going to be the opposite of a fairweather friend (good in crisis, bad at just being around), but you're young enough that you probably don't have to if you decide not to. 

And really, you don't HAVE to do anything. This is just an old man ""Don't be like me"" speech, and maybe this isn't the time that it's going to sink in and be useful to you, and that's OK to. Just know that what you're going through isn't stupid or weird. That lots of people have similar issues and have gotten to much better places in their lives, so there is no reason that you can't be one of them.

I am a sarcastic asshole, you can take about 50% of what I say as a joke. I do love to laugh and can be a wonderful icebreaker, as long as you can read the room a bit. Mind you, I also am very cognizant of the fact that their is a grain of truth at the bottom of every joke. So I try to not push it too far in that pursuit. At the end of the day, I love making people smile, plan and simple. Everyones laugh is unique and it can really help, at least for me, to even glean something about them. All I am saying is that I don't want to bring people down to crack a joke, I have in the past and it really bothers me. Though thankfully hasn't happened in awhile.

Side note, also is kind of important to pay attention and be very confident in yourself, at least if you are going to crack a joke. You need to pay attention because you can generally tell pretty quickly whether or not someone is down for banter at a certain level. You need to be fine with yourself because if you are going to crack jokes... you better be willing to be the butt end of one yourself. Tis only fair after all.

Good on you for keeping cool, I don't know the person you speak of...but to me, there is a very glaring line between a good natured joke not meant to offend and a thinly veiled personal attack. That second one is toxic as shit and I almost think people like that... almost craft those kind of ""jokes"" in such a way, specifically to bite deep.
Just my two cents from my own life. Assholes are assholes, jokes can be jokes. Too much of anything is bad, especially if you are making jokes about others. If someone mentions something to me about feeling uncomfortable or just not ok with banter, I simply respect their wishes.

It's not your fault that you turned out the way you did, but its your choice to stay that way. You are holding yourself responsible and accountable, which is what functional adults do and shows a degree of emotional intelligence.

I found the book ""Radical Acceptance"" to be pretty good for working through this type of stuff, although I wouldn't recommend all of the meditation activities. I'm also a big fan of the Mark Manson blog. There is no shame in wanting to do better, anyone that looks down on you instead of helping (within reason) isn't someone that you should be spending a lot of time with.

Also, from the perspective and experience of your own personal improvement, you can better empathize and understand, meaning you can be a better person/friend to people.

Keep up the hard work, these things don't fix themselves or change as fast as we like. It's pretty gradual and you don't notice the changes every day, but they are there. Part of the process is seeing more undesirable parts of ourselves as we improve, this is not because we are inherently good or bad, it just is (ie it is how we choose tp perceive it). Good luck!"
soc_346442,socialskills,reddit_comment,238,"This used to be a huge problem for me. I always think about what other people say. Opening up to people has been an ongoing work in progress over the past few years. I've definitely felt like I'm blabbing when I talk about myself, but putting myself out there has really helped me make more friends and become better friends with my current ones.

I think that if you have negative feelings after opening up to someone, it is due the other person not being empathetic or just not responding in a caring manner. I am a very private person, and I will only open up to certain people- people who I know will be empathetic or offer me advice. Everyone is different, so I don't expect all of my friends to give me the advice I need for all my problems. I will sometimes go to certain friends for certain situations, because I know that person has the experience or time to advise or comfort me. 

I think you have to learn to accept your actions and problems, whatever they may be. We're all weird, do weird things sometimes, and have problems. I definitely obsess over things, and I have to tell myself to stop, it'll be ok, no one will remember in a few days because they're probably thinking about their own problems.

I'm a man in late 30s so I can give you some insights. You are overthinking this way too much.  
It's very simple, men pursue women, all the time. No questions asked, **subconsciously** we want all the women.   
That being said, we can of course be platonic however any friendship will always have the possibility of turning into a relationship if we sense that the woman is interested in us.

So with that knowledge , as a woman you should be aware of **not sending romantic signals his way,** if you want to remain friends that is. Simply, keep the conversations very casual, don't flirt at all, don't constantly call / text , etc. 

On the other hand, if you actually want him as a partner, then gently let ***him*** pursue you. Flirt a bit, show interest but certainly don't turn into a doormat. Men will (generally) lose interest if that happens (I \_know\_ this). 

Don't forget, he might still misinterpret things, so it's up to you to steer him in whatever direction you want this to go.

For example: if you want people to like you, you should tell them to like you. I don't exactly mean directly but - I kind of do. If you talk positively about yourself, people will believe positive things about you. Therefore: practice talking positively about yourself in social situations. Of course, there's a fine line between being confident and bragging, and that line seems to me to be in sincerity. So, if I'm telling a story or talking about an experience, I don't try to make myself look good or come off any kind of way except for the way I acted.

&amp;#x200B;

It's likely that a lot of people in this subreddit dislike themselves. That's kind of the core of the rant from OP, and without digging any further into it, I guess the common response is ""we all suck sometimes and that's okay :)"" which is unhelpful, because again, it's inactionable, and it doesn't really address the core issue. Why love something that sucks? I don't eat peas because I don't like them. I don't put them in my food. I don't cook them for others. Why would I? I don't like them. If you don't like something about yourself, or if you don't like yourself, you can change. Certainly there is someone, real or fictional, that you like. Emulate the things about them that you like. If that doesn't work for you, or you don't like it, try a different thing. In high school, I didn't like myself, but I really liked this teacher I had, Ms. Fish. She was earnest, helpful, kind. I primarily focused on her earnestness - that's how I wanted to be. That's a hard quality to isolate, and challenging to emulate - I'm still working on it. But the thing I tried to do is, embrace the things that I enjoy, as a first step. Then I stopped beating myself up about it for being weird because this person I admired didn't seem to put herself down over the things she enjoyed. Finally, and I guess this is the one I'm still figuring out to an extent, I let my guard down around other people. No more hiding behind sarcasm, no more putting down someone's weird interest to make my less-weird interest look better, less couching myself in excuses. All that is scary. But it's had a great effect on my life. People like me. I like me. Maybe that's not the quality in someone that you want to emulate, but that's fine - everyone is different. But find those qualities and make them your own.

&amp;#x200B;

Last is, I guess, practical advice. I've heard it said that interested people are interesting, and that's totally true! But it's not helpful if you're not generally interested in others. Regardless of whether you're engaged or not, if you practice paying attention, that will help in conversations. Sometimes classes in school were boring but you still had to, in some capacity, pay attention in order to pass, right? Do that but for conversations. If you master that, the next step is asking questions. You don't want to always ask questions and extend conversations on forever, that gets weird. But a couple of questions asking a person to expand on something they've said go a long way towards getting that person to remember you or like you, and whether you're interested or not, it'll look like you're interested. Once you're good at asking questions, then you might begin to notice opportunities to share your own experiences. You don't want to just wait until your turn to speak - that's why you practice paying attention first - you want to find opportunities to meaningfully contribute to the conversation. I don't know if there's anything after that, those 3 things have gotten me pretty far. And they're all skills, really - I wanted people to talk to me over chat programs back in the day while I was bedridden with Crohn's Disease. To keep people's interest, I had to learn to keep the conversation going, which meant paying attention and asking questions. After I recovered and got back out into the world, I learned you can basically just... do that, but in real life.

&amp;#x200B;

So that's what I'd propose as the alternative. Those all seem more practical than the things listed in the OP."

I know when I don’t confess my feelings to a girl, I grow more and more uncomfortable as I try to filter out what I say or second guess my actions but that’s just me. Do what you feel is best.

And about the fear of failure, one of the ways that has been helpful to me is treating myself like a best friend. If my best friend were to walk up to somebody, say something stupid, and walk back would I call them an idiot and hate it? No! I’d laugh it off and continue on. Bad stuff will happen, but if you don’t punish yourself to hard, it should be better. Just spread good vibes and your good!

soc_1672834,socialskills,reddit_comment,334,"I think this comes down to ""how to not keep repeating the same mistakes, and do/say the right thing in all instances"", which sounds like a very difficult thing, impossible for most people, but there is an easier way of looking at it.

People who are slightly more aware of themselves than average will often become aware of some habit of theirs, for example you called it ""annoying"", but it could just as easily be ""a quiet voice"", and just because they are aware of it they become *more* reactive to it and lose some control of the ability. In short, they feel like they have been given a part of themself that they didn't ask for, and want desperately to get rid of it.

But this belief hides behind the greater belief that some part of you can be wrong, or broken. In reality, while you may have tipped the balances a little, you are not broken. And in fact, it is the very part of yourself that you might feel is broken that is crying out to you to be understood and cared for, because something is being lost in translation here. Some deep physical need (and it is not the need for love or attention from another person) is coming to the surface, and instead of listening to it, you are trying to get rid of it.

Everyone's situation is different, so I encourage you to seek within yourself to see if there isn't some belief or guilt or hurt that you are holding on to that isn't serving you any more. Because all of your feelings and expressions are worthy of your attention and it is only through the care that you show them that you will be able to project yourself, a whole and packaged ego, outward in a way that nobody will be able to deny as complete and strong and beautiful. You deserve love and the love you give yourself is proof to yourself of that fact."
soc_923008,socialskills,reddit_comment,379,"Hi, another 20F here (:

I have postural problems, too, because I have scoliosis. A good way to work on that is to strengthen your core muscles through pilates ([abs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzEc2ERXhZs)/[back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20FrIUxx-iI)). If you're not into pilates, try swimming!

Acne-wise, everyone is different, so try to visit a dermatologist if you can. My sister cleared hers up with some clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide cream that she got from the doctor. Mine cleared up when I started doing less to my face — no more harsh acne washes or exfoliators, just a gentle Cetaphil face wash and sunscreen everyday.

And I know it's easier said than done, but you need to start embracing the little things that make you who you are. No quality is inherently bad. In fact, the things you're insecure about might just be the very things that other people admire in you. Example: your accent. Having an accent shows that you're worldly, that you're smart enough to be fully bilingual, that you have a unique perspective on life that native-born people don't have — in short, it's attractive.

Also, comparing yourself to other girls isn't productive, nor is it fair, because you're only dwelling on the things you admire about them rather than looking at the whole picture. If you absolutely cannot help it, then I'd suggest you at least look for the qualities that you have in common with other girls. For example, I used to hate my curly hair; seeing my brother's girlfriend wear her curls so proudly inspired me to embrace mine. 

The last thing I'm going to add is that there's no shame in getting help. We learn a lot about math and literature and science in school, but no one teaches us how to deal with the really hard problems in life: insecurity, anxiety, loneliness, etc. It's not your fault that you're struggling with this and you shouldn't have to face it alone. You mentioned that you're in university; a lot of universities have free counselling services, so you should check out what's available to you (and try to do this as early in the semester as possible, wait times tend to be shortest then). 

If you're not ready for counselling, try googling ""[exposure therapy](https://www.anxietycanada.com/sites/default/files/FacingFears_Exposure.pdf)"" for the anxiety — it's helped me in the past."
soc_1839426,socialskills,reddit_comment,332,"It seems like you're in a difficult situation, and might be quite young as well.
Unfortunately, if you're in high school or younger a lot of this behavior comes down to immaturity, and that takes time for people to grow out of (hopefully).

I would encourage you to reflect on whether these friendships or worth keeping. However, if you'd like to keep them as acquaintances that's up to you. As, I know these years are complicated, and usually so are friendships.

If so, try to set boundaries with the problematic friends in the group ie., reduce time spent and/or talking with them, reduce sharing sensitive information with them, etc. If you can work on building different (and hopefully healthier), friendships with others via clubs or outside-of-school extracurriculars. Try to join school clubs and activities as a legitimate excuse to move away from them as well.

It's good that you're comfortable standing up for yourself. If the conversation is getting heated/problematic just walk away, change the subject or just shut it down asap ie., hey, it's not that serious let's talk about something else.
**communcation boundaries can be quite helpful in such situations. Have pre-planned excuses/exit phrases to make things easier.

It can be difficult to expose liars, and deal with verbally abusive people because they feed off of any form of attention.
The best thing to do is condition them to stop finding the situation entertaining.
Have a minimal (yet bold) or joking reaction to the behavior.
Keep your body language unbothered, and relaxed if possible.

Pick your battles. Not everyone is worth fighting, and you can support others by just being there for the ie., hanging out with them, sharing snacks or joking around with them etc.
Yeah, even if it's these people are buttholes, most people don't enjoy hearing about it, so...
Unless you're prepared to handle the consequences of your words, try to be mindful.

soc_1086038,socialskills,reddit_comment,362,"&gt;a little too convenient if you just murdered someone.

Exactly why the justice system relies on free will being real. I don't think you're really understanding me here. I agree I have control over my actions, but I don't control my wants. I can actively think: ""Hey, I actually am worth it"", but it won't be true unless I want it to be. Yes, I can condition myself to want that to be true, but do I want to? It's an endless loop. And I'm not pretending like it's out of my control (at least I think so). I'm very well aware that it is within my control to do something. I've said that on numerous ocations. I've also never said that I don't put in the work, you've just assumed that (quite justified in doing so, lol). If me being a better person for the benefit of others means I have to start liking myself, so be it, I'll do my best.

Also, take everything I say with a grain of salt, I don't really take anything seriously and mostly just ponder these things for fun, not to actually get anything out of it. In the end I just don't think these things are that important even though it feels like it. We all die in the end and nothing matters, so I choose to laugh at as much as possible. Sometimes it's hard, sometimes it's easy. I also try to not expect too much of people. If I'm trying to help someone and all they can muster is excuses, I simply let them be because there is nothing I can do for them if they don't want to help themselves. I'll be there if they want to talk, and I'll help them if they want the help. But I'm not gonna judge them for not wanting to help themselves and making excuses. We're all humans, we all suck, be nice to each other.

Lastly, to deflect any accusation of me making excuses. I accept full responsibility for all of my actions, and if that action is making excuses, so be it. Sorry that I'm a bit of a brick wall."

If a guy asks you to hang out, he literally probably just wants to chill and play video games or something. These are the best times you'll have in high school. Go out, laugh, be stupid together. Go on adventures.

If a girl asks you to hang out, it's more likely than not in a romantic context, especially if it seems out of the blue. Judging by your question here, I'm assuming you aren't exactly the best at picking up on cues like that (I still kick myself for missing a few to this day, don't sweat it.).

soc_582654,socialskills,reddit_comment,118,"I think that part of it depends on the person you're talking. You have to gauge the amount of responsiveness that they are going to give. As far as in a conservation you would want to start with 'superficial' talk and pick at certain parts to ask 'deeper' questions. The conservation shouldn't shift abruptly but flow naturally. For part of that you have to have something that you can contribute to the conversation rather than letting the other person just talk. 

Something to work on for yourself is empathy. Having a more genuine reason to interact with others makes it easier to do all of this. Besides even if don't you could try it just to try it."

Be affirmative and when you finish your sentence hold their hand with yours and remove your forearm and suddenly distant your hand from theirs. 
2- when they use gestures that make you feel being infantilied, mirror them even if they were older than you, they must respect you and feel what you feel.

soc_1383428,socialskills,reddit_comment,333,"The problem here is that ""ego"" has two distinct meanings. What you're doing when you're retreating into the background is pouring the baby out with the bathwater.

Ego is just a word for the self. It just is. It's your unique way of seeing the world, the bit of you that makes you yourself.

What you're describing as toxic is the need to protect the ego because to you, it's kind of fragile. You're afraid of being hurt, or of being erased, or of other people not confirming your value (or of not measuring up to your own standarts). When you retreat, you are protecting yourself from this by making it your choice.

The solution, ideally, is to actually cultivate a stronger sense of self. Know who you are and where you stand in the world. What are your values and your needs. Try to understand how you think, what patterns you are repeating in life. And be kind to yourself. You're a unique human being with inherent value. Just as everyone else. To have a strong and solid ego means you don't need to compete and compare because you know who you are and nothing will change about that if someone does better or worse than you.

As a side note, there is a lot to be said for a flexible and action based self-concept. It's much better to think of yourself as someone who enjoys solving puzzles and learning new things as opposed to thinking of yourself as ""smart"". Because if you think of yourself as ""smart"", you'll always worry if you're smart *enough*. You'll be scared of being found out as *not* smart. But if you're just a guy who likes doing puzzles and who got kind of good at it, there's a lot less pressure when facing the same problem.

Being into getting drunk and dancing doesn't make you boring. I absolutely hate dancing and sitting at a bar drinking, but I wouldn't consider myself boring. I'm in welding school and create art projects on the side, I shoot archery, I've almost got my A license for skydiving, and I'm getting into cinematic drone flying to be able to post cool videos when I go camping. 

I personally think these things aren't boring, they interest me infinitely more than hanging out at the bar and I feel like the quality of person I meet doing these activities are also way more interesting than those you'd find at a bar or club.

I'm introverted as fuck and didn't really start breaking out of my shell until I started pursuing the things that interested me rather than seeking places to meet people. I feel like once you start doing things you find interesting, the social aspect kind of comes with it. It's not weird to pursue hobbies alone.

soc_34524,socialskills,reddit_comment,306,"There are three ways to look at it.  One is that you're better off alone.  Let's throw that one out right at the beginning, because you're clearly dissatisfied and looking for something better.  You need to connect with people to satisfy your yearning for human contact; if you didn't need it, you wouldn't feel lonely and wouldn't be asking for advice.  

The second way of looking at it is that you need to learn to enjoy yourself in social situations so you can feel connected and not feel left out all the time.  The third way of looking at it is that there's nothing wrong with you, and you're failing to engage because you're trying with the wrong people.  These two perspectives are probably both right.  One is probably a bigger problem than the other, but there's no way to know which except to work on both of them and see which front you make progress on.  Making progress on one front will help you make progress on the other:  finding people you get along with better will ease the learning curve of becoming more social, and being more social will bring into contact with a lot of people and help you find your crowd.  There's a lot of advice on /r/socialskills for learning how to be more social in the kinds of situations you're talking about.

Oh, and... drink?  If not drinking is just a personal preference, it's a good idea to at least experiment with compromising this preference for the sake of feeling what others are feeling.  If it's something you can't compromise on, like a religious conviction or a health issue, maybe you could socialize through a church or through some other group where nobody drinks.  Either that or work on learning to loosen up and enjoy yourself with others who are drinking.

If you’re concerned about vengeance or justice, that will come to her on its own. No need to get involved in that IMO. If she’s a gaslighter, there’s a chance she’s a manipulator. You’ll regret setting the chessboard with someone like that because it’s like they play by different rules with monopoly pieces. To them it makes perfect sense to play their game and tell you later they win. 

Fact is, you’re only capable of being in control of your own self, words, emotions, and responses. If she says anything to gaslight you, let her and just say “oh, ok”. No big reaction. If she’s about control as you say, She will realize that you’re not a source for drama; and she’ll move on.

Let go of the control you are putting on this (or any) relationship. Try to let go of the expectations from another person. Let her be as she is. If she enjoys your company, and if you also enjoy, then sure spend some time with her.

soc_9866,socialskills,reddit_comment,571,"Sounds like what you saying is that you wanna learn how to have a conversation. without knowing more I'll try teach what I learnt that best applies to you.

Forget talking about school. Its usually a no way street and talking about it falls under social obligation. She's had that conversation dozens of times already.

As to what to talk about. Ask questions initially to start the conversational momentum. Awkward silence is a example of no momentum. Questions will be your push to get the conversational momentum going.   

What question do you ask? You thinks she's cute right, ask about her. What are her interest? Does she have sisters? Are they close? does she travel? Does she play video games? Why the hell don't you play video games? pokemon even?  Whatever you wanna know or would interest you.  You CAN cater these question to typically thing that would interest girls like: to spark the interest initially but if you can't follow up its a dead end.    

Next Key is to LISTEN, when you ask a question you listen, she's going to give you a bunch of potential topics or non topics to  follow up on.  Don't ask the obvious question.  For example. if you ask if she has a sister and its a yes. Don't ask her How old is she, or the next socially obligated question. Instead you can, maybe, assume she's a older sister, that she has big sister vibe.  Then that can move to a discussion about her personality habits and thought, self perception, experience as big sister, etc. See how a conversation can evolve quickly.  Stay positive, no therapy type threads.

Though this won't make her hot for you, The goal here is be a curious fun cool chill guy. Depending on how old you are that can be enough for her to be hot for you.

Now to to prepare.  Try this exercise.  If you have a close friend thats trustworthy and open to you improving you conversational skill.  Try word association: its where one person says on world, topic or phrase. and then the other talks about it for 2 mins. Go beyond just describing the thing. For example. Say they say chocolate. This can remind you of Christmas, and then you talk about you fav christmas memory. The idea is get use to talking and and creating new conversational threads.

You fine tune once you get this down, learn to steer conversation based on the feedback from the other person.
Learn Intuitively what to start with and where to go. You only get getter the more you do it. Talk to everyone, small talk with cashiers, random ppl, you family, friends, dog, call up your old cousins, your neighbour. 

DO NOT TELL your friends that you like her. At least not just yet. Unless you really trust her to help you and that you're confident she can help in the right way.  Otherwise, you may be creating a situation outta your control. Telling your friend assumes that your making her your pseudo wing girl.  And unless she gets it and wants to help you properly, then don't. Also this means that the process of her digging you is up to you. and if you do create a situation that outta your control then maybe via fate, you do end up dating. However, Ill tell you, leaving things to fate sucks, make you own luck.

As such, I try to give other people that same benefit. It hurts, it sucks, I may need to take some time to nurse my wounds, vent to some friends, whatever... but they're ALLOWED to not be interested and they DON'T owe me an explanation.

Now, I say all that because you asked ""how to deal with rejection"".

HOWEVER, that said... I wouldn't even classify that as rejection. Unless it is something super time sensitive or high stakes or something... which ""yo, wanna hang out sometime?"" definitely is NOT... I personally don't even bat an eye at a lack of response from anyone for anything if its been less than 36hrs. Life happens. Sometimes you're busy, sometimes HELL you just don't feel like talking to anyone or responding to any texts or maybe you just don't really feel like talking to that SPECIFIC person or responding to THEM right this MOMENT and that may or may not reflect AT ALL on your overall feelings for them. I've gone days w/out getting back to people for... pretty much no reason other than ""meh, don't feel like it"" or literally just keep forgetting. Its not my best quality and I work on being a lil more prompt these days BUT... again... I try not to hold other people to higher standards than I can reasonably meet myself so... if it was something casual like that n I happen not to have heard back from someone n its only been like a day or two? Unless its someone whose usually pretty prompt and I'm like legitimately worried about them being okay? I don't assume it means a damn thing. Most the time they'll get back to me eventually."
soc_1695891,socialskills,reddit_comment,154,"Yes, it is. Nothing is impossible, you just need the right motivation to meet 3-4 new people and the rest will come with time. I'm saying such a small number because you only need to get to know one guy from a different friend group. Then after some time, can take weeks to months, you will eventually end up with a friend group of one of these people that you met in the beginning.

So after getting them to know you if you look interesting they'll try to fit you in their friend group then you'll get to know 6-12 new people from each person you just talked to. 4x8 = 32 people that you'll meet in the next 2-3 months if you manage to get another person to know you. Then it's up to you, you'll decide which friend group you want to keep as your main people and boom, you got friends"
soc_95382,socialskills,reddit_comment,268,"If you're sick of it you should speak up.   Here, try some of my custom created responses to their bullshit:

Friend 1: ""Lol lazyambitious is black but he talks white!""

Lazyambitious: ""Best of both worlds mothafucka, and at least I don't talk like a bitch""



Friend 2: ""Is it cool with you if I tell a black joke?""

Lazyambitious: ""What kind of a question is that?  Is it cool if I kick you in the face?""



*Lights shut off*
Friend 2: ""How where did lazyambitious go?""

Lazyambitious: ""I went to fuck your mom up the ass""



Play it by ear though, that mom thing can easily backfire if his mom is dead, and sometimes you just don't know.  Socially speaking you might alienate yourself from the group if that were to ever happen.  Mind you your friends appear to be a bunch of racist jerks, so maybe good riddance, eh?  I mean, who am I to judge, but you should not let people walk over you like that.  It used to happen to me under completely different non-racist circumstances, but the worst thing I ever did was to continue pretending that it doesn't bother me..  while at the same time it really did.  Stand up for yourself, even if it means pissing some people off.  

And obviously don't use the above examples, but you get the point.  I guess the key is to not be passive aggressive about it, but neither to be too aggressive about it either.  You must find a good balance.

soc_1077597,socialskills,reddit_comment,150,"OP's advice is very context sensitive. It really depends on the person you're meeting, the reason for meeting, how you and the person came to be meeting up, where you're meeting and any number of other factors. If someone's having a bad day, the above approach could tip them either way. If someone is nervous, being stared and smiled at could be very unsettling or irritating. Two seconds doesn't sound like a lot, but it can feel like a long time in this situation. *""People will always remember how you make them feel""* maybe, but they can remember you as a presumptive arrogant prick just as easily as they can a super-positive, friendly, awesome person. 
Also, first impressions are important, but they're not carved in stone and can be altered over time, for better or worse.

soc_822601,socialskills,reddit_comment,401,"Firstly I think that the balance between toxic friends and alienating yourself is a really good one. I’m a more introverted 23 year old and have definitely experienced this a lot in my life. My initial reaction would be to tell you to be less openly critical but at the end of the day, it’s your decision what type of people you want in your life and you can set a high standard but you have to be willing to face the consequences of that.

I have a friend group and a lot of times I do think “god these guys are assholes, why are they in my life?” especially since going to college and making friends with a completely different set of people. Eventually one weekend the biggest asshole of the group said something completely uncalled for and a straight up called him out, said everything I had against him and left.

I really thought that had made me lose all my friends and for a while it sort of did. The other guys would invite me to things but we’d both be there and just awkwardly not say a word to each other and I don’t think anyone liked the energy in the room. It also wasn’t something I could really apologise for because I still thought he was an asshole. For one reason or another he started hanging around with that group less and less so in the end it worked out. The other guys are still slightly shitty at times. They live on terrible offence jokes for shock humour (I wouldn’t even mind if they weren’t so unfunny and constant) and 1 of them is a bit manipulative. This kind of stops me from ever letting them too far into my life like I might with my college friends who I trust more. However despite their flaws they’re still nice guys at heart (bar 1 maybe). 

I guess my point is that I think there’s a lot of complicated grey areas in this topic. Nice people can still be a bit shitty at times so maybe jumping to criticism isn’t always the best approach. Although brilliant people that you’ll love do exist, they can be tough to find and in the meantime it’s not a bad thing to be pals with some slightly flawed people, just don’t set your standard too low. I guess that’s my philosophy."
soc_1815046,socialskills,reddit_comment,200,"You've got a lot of hobbies that would be interesting to others.

Just a data point from personal experience: maybe 1 out of 15 or 20 people that I talk to would be interested in talking about my hobbies or shared interests. If you haven't found someone to build rapport with, it could be that you ended up chatting with the 14 people that were busy and/or less interested.

Occasionally there's a person (say once a year or few months) that's really interested in a subject or hobby and those chats pick up themselves. 

If you haven't connected with people on deeper level could be just that you haven't found the non-busy person yet :)

FWIW, I found my wife in a Karate class some years ago and we were friends for 2 years before realizing things would escalate from there. The class was 40 people or so. I had some friends there, nothing too deep. If I'd come to reddit before things picked up with my wife, I'd probably say ""I haven't made a very deep connection with anyone in the last 2 years"".

Hope this helps as data point. :) Of course, everyone is different, and experiences vary."
soc_1013033,socialskills,reddit_comment,261,"It’s always good to have goals. I see you say you don’t have motivation so some goals are great for that. Even little ones. Saving money, investing, exercise, hiking, cars, whatever. People with interests are interesting. It sucks being in a group that isn’t responsive to you so fuck it. If they don’t make you feel good why does it matter what they think? You can find any ol group then and it’d be just as good or better in that case. Find friends that bring value. 

Next, you deserve to be comfortable in your own skin. It’s not your choice you have your body, mind, family, or interests so you damn well be able to be comfortable in your own skin. Never apologize for asking a question like this ever again. You’re a man and you do what you want and don’t worry about consequences. What’s the worst that can happen? You lose a couple friends that don’t add value to your life anyway? 

Anyway just speak up and make jokes. Say dumb shit. Most of this is trial and error. Think of it as a game. See if you can get people to laugh. Make sure your voice is loud, clear, and heard. Also if you speak monotone, look up videos on how to add inflection to your words. Expressing emotion through words helps a lot with comedy, story telling, or just making a point. It takes work but it’s well worth it so you don’t feel like a piece of shit anymore. We’ve all been there. Good luck."
soc_1389951,socialskills,reddit_comment,196,"What you said can be passable in english given the context although it would have been better to say ""Men wouldn’t find her company interesting NOR she theirs"". When you say ""AND she theirs"" you aren't carrying the negative of the not in wouldn't into the next statement.

Also because we are saying neither statement is true ""she would interest them"" / ""they would interest her"" we use OR instead of AND.

If it were the case that we were saying both would interest each other we could use AND though

Eg: ""Men would find her company interesting AND she theirs"" is correct - Both A AND B

""Men wouldn't find her company interesting NOR she theirs"" is correct - Neither A NOR B

""Men would find her company interesting OR she theirs"" doesn't really work without more context because they shouldn't be mutually exclusive - sounds like A OR B but is really A is opposite to B

""Men wouldn't find her company interesting AND she theirs"" doesn't make sense because you don't carry the negative - reads as Not A but Yes B when you intended Not (A and B)

Hopefully that makes sense"
soc_1091936,socialskills,reddit_comment,389,"OP, nobody is going to message you first just like that.  If you insist people message you first,  you need to know how to connect with them on a deeper level, especially in person. Some tips.

**You have to be confident and bring positive vibes to your interactions**. You say you are funny, and that's a good thing, but is that the only good thing about you ? What other positive character traits do you have besides being funny ? Your overall positivity and high energy are what attract people. Consistently lacking in this department will make people avoid you.

**Take initiative and leadership**. Don't wait around for other people to invite you. Why don't you invite them to your own activities ? Instead of texting, why don't you do a Zoom call and invite people to that ? Trust me, a lot of people will remember and appreciate you doing this.

**Make conversations meaningful, memorable, and purposeful**. Don't merely do polite small talk. Exchange ideas, interests, and hobbies with each other. Talk about yourself, and get them to talk about themselves as well !

**Find ways to consistently bring/provide value to other people's lives**. What are your expertise/services ? Offer to use them to help other people. People love it when you contribute to their lives. They look up to you as knowledgeable and wise.

**Don't be needy.** Neediness is repulsive no matter what connection you have with other people. Don't do things such as contacting the same person or few people over and over again out of desperation or thirst. Don't freak out and confront people when they become distant towards you for whatever reason. In general, don't get hung up on one person or a few people.

**You have to be willing to give people space from time to time**. Life will get in the way of your connections and put everything on hold. People are not always going to be available to you. One day, they might respond to your text/call. Another day, these same people won't for whatever reason. When people are distant, remain cool, calm, and collected. Go do your own thing, live your genuinely busy life pursuing your hobbies and goals, and talk to other people on the side. Always keep moving forward. You will earn a lot of respect that way."
soc_1465144,socialskills,reddit_comment,629,"That's tough, and it depends on the person.  Some people are bullies because it makes them feel powerful in a space where they can be. people in general don't want to be hurt and don't like feel threatened. Fight or flight is a powerful tool, but be able to determine who will flee, and who will fight is harder is a matter of observation. 

This is an area where the philosophy by Sun Tzu really comes in handy. If you don't know who that is, he's An ancient Chinese Military strategist.  He has a rule that says ""know thy enemy as you know thyself and you should not lose a battle"" in this case knowing which one of your bullies will backdown at being threatened, and knowing which's ones will provoke you into a physical altercation is important

Some you can literally stand up to their face and  egg them on and they'll back down, while others  will take you upon it. knowing the difference is super important. Most of the time the bullying is a fear tactic in order to keep you in line. so not showing that you're intimated is important, look them straight in the eye,  keep your breathing as calm as possible, and respond as calmly as possible. don't argue with them that they are wrong or that they saying isn't true. what they want more often than not is an emotional confrontation, because it allows them to escalate it so they can feel justified.  So be dismissive if they are throwing out lies and making threats ""Well it's your choice to believe that if you want to.  that doesn't make it true, but it is your choice."" etc. I can't give you words as every situation is different. but think about how those interactions go. Realize that more often than not most bullies do so because they have shitty home lives and it's the only place that they have any power.   


I know this next part is easy to say but hard to really to emotionally understand and accept.  It is very likely that It is not your fault that you are being targeted.   


so you did something different, you said something strange, that doesn't make you worthy of being a target.  you are clearly self aware and have shown capability to have the kind of conscience thought that they probably cannot.   


If you cannot tell if someone is joking with you verses being picked on, ask yourself the question about their history. If a joke you don't like and you feel comfortable with it ask them to stop.  if they do then you work from there.   


last of all. Trust. your. instincts.  If something in you makes you go ""Hrmm.."" Then listen to it. it doesn't always make sense but more times than not you will be better off.   


I wish I had a solid ""This is what you do in every situation"" book to give you, but I don't.    


I only have experience.  As I teen in high school I was heavily picked and bullied.  I was pushed out of the locker room naked. I was left in dumpsters, I was jumped from behind and forced face first in a garbage can that was filled with snow, had the lid tied on and they rolled me down a hill and left me there.  I know how bad it can get. I hope you never experience what I did. as an adult I learned that most of those kids were beaten, neglected and heavily abused at home I was the target of their powerlessness. That is how most people become bullies to other.

I’m not calling you a loser but that’s why I said that we don’t know you and you might actually not be a fun person to hang with, idk but you can make friends it takes some confidence and the right mindset, people are always willing to be friendly and with some self reflection and bettering of yourself you’re bound to make some friends.

You're being naive to think that people won't change over time, the only thing I can say for certain is that the reason you're being jealous is because you know, and he's rubbing it on your face, that he's having fun with someone else and you're clearly putting him on a throne as if you wish you were like him and led the same lifestyle as he does, that's what it sounds like to me, I ain't no expert but that's pretty obvious.

On the other hand I've experienced something similar, not as extreme as that, but similar. The way I dealt with it was to simply live my own life, just did my shit moved with my life and focused on myself rather than spending my entire day thinking about how X person is doing with their life and how I wish I'd been there, eventually the jealousy went away.

Just hear me out, you're calling him, he won't pick it up, you text him to vent out, he won't reply or ignores you, you try to make plans, he just shuts it down.

About being shut down by your crush, that'll literally be the first of many, wether you keep your chin up or not that's entirely up to you and how you see this, she just wasn't into you as much as you were into her, that's how it is, nothing else, you saw something in her that she didn't see in you that's her loss, what you can't do is bash yourself as if you're nothing just because you didn't luck out.

Not out loud to her face, but quietly to yourself - give her permission to turn you down.

soc_40612,socialskills,reddit_comment,489,"Nerd here, who has always had some amount of social anxiety. I used to see a psychologist. I don't think I need to anymore. Here's why:

To up my social skills, I did a project for a class on what makes people more successful is social situations. This is how you do it:

* Be in public places. Trust me, even if you're alone in public places, people will approach you at some point, even if it's just to ask for directions. This will help you get in social practice a little bit at a time, so it's not too frightening.

* Learn some techniques for relaxing around others. Meditation has always calmed me down. I'd look up a guide on how to do it.

* Make sure people can relate to you. The easiest way is to have some sort of activity that people will approach you and talk to you about. This can be anything. For me, when I smoked, cigarettes and weed actually netted me a lot of friends because people would just walk up and start talking to me about them. However I'm not going to recommend using them. You could try something nerdier. That may be your style. I play Magic: The Gathering. Nerds will walk up to you and want to play, even if you're just organizing decks by yourself. You can carry around any number of activities: I keep a frisbee to toss and a set for frisbee golf in the trunk of my car at all times. Are people bored around you? Do they need something to do? Oh look, you have a frisbee in the back of your car. Instant activity.

* It may be difficult, but pretty much all socially successful people employ some method of touching their environment. Social people are touchy. They lean on other people's tables, they sit on coffee tables, they put their feet up, they touch other people's elbows and shoulders and they shake hands and give high-fives. This is probably a more advanced step, once you feel a little more comfortable in social situations. But you'll need to practice it (perhaps even before you make friends).

* Remember: people love free spirits. Shed your inhibitions, and you'll attract people. The less you care about what other people think of how you're currently behaving, the more other people will care about you. Don't be afraid to make mistakes, do outrageous things, piss people off, and lose potential friends. The things you do that would push one person away may bring two people into your life. But if you do nothing, nobody's going to notice. Like I said, meditation is the method I've used for relieving anxiety so that I *can* release my inhibitions and be social.

Anyway, I hope this helps. Don't delay your social life! It'll bring a level of happiness and satisfaction to your life that you may never have known existed!"

Being sensitive is a great quality, don't feel bad about it, cry, laugh, dance, scream, do everything you can to enjoy this mechanism our brains have called emotions, you can only experience them while you're alive, they're the most real things in this world, everyone is different and although one single person might not mean much to the crowd, that one person can change the crowd itself by interacting with it.

soc_336911,socialskills,reddit_comment,124,"Eye contact is really important, avoiding eye contact sub-communicates things like shame, anxiety, and disinterest. By avoiding eye contact you’re creating these emotions in people. However to much eye contact communicates aggression and makes people trust you less. It’s a fine line to walk and depending on how you want to be seen you should make different levels of eye contact and smile different amounts 

•warm and friendly; lots especially while they are talking and smile 

•energetic and fun; lots of brief eye contact with smiles but look around the room ever so often

•Powerful and authoritative; very little eye contact while they are talking and lots while you are

Everyone is different and this is a general guide but I hope I helped.

What I usually do is play it safe and assume there is nothing romantic going on.  I figure that if I'm wrong I can repair things if I realize at some point that the other person was asking me out, but if I assume it's a date when it's not then I may screw something up and create an embarrassment that I can't possibly fix.  So I'd go to the movies with the whole gang, make sure to sit next to her, give her most of my attention, and try really hard to pick up on any signals during the night.


Good luck!



Also, forget that whole ""workplace relationships are a bad idea"" thing.  Where the hell else are we going to meet people?  At a club?  No thanks.  If I build feelings for someone at work I'm going to act upon them.  If things don't work out then I'll behave like an adult and a professional, and I expect them to do the same.  A break-up doesn't need to lead to drama.  This is real life we're living, not a TV show.

soc_1232975,socialskills,reddit_comment,250,"Is there more context to this? If you’re talking about a local business, then just be honest. If you’re talking about a chain, good luck.

One would already hope that at a local business that the employees are getting paid enough and are treated fairly enough to where they would already be motivated to provide good customer service, because they have a healthy working environment. 

You actually don’t have any stake in that. It’s not up to you.

By being indirect, you can actually very easily put people off because they can sense that you were beating around the bush.

Being passive and indirect, especially when dealing with small businesses, freelancers, or those in between will almost always cause more stress. 

People cannot read minds. However, people who work in the hospitality industry are extremely good at telling when people are being genuine or not. They live through people being disingenuous every day. They’re basically trained to sense it. 

If you want excellent customer service, treat the employee how you wish that you would be treated if you were in their shoes.

If they give you great customer service, let them know. Be honest and open. If it is a situation where you can tip them, tip some extra.

tldr: you can’t do this passively, it won’t work and it will come off as passive aggressive. Be open and honest, and if you receive excellent customer service, praise and tip - or write a great Yelp or Google Maps review."
soc_848456,socialskills,reddit_comment,426,"I think you should try to say what you have on your mind confidently. Maybe that mind of yours has more interesting things to say if you let it out. And I also think it comes down to how much energy you have when speaking. If you can learn a good conversation dynamic, instead of just going from point A to point B when responding to someone, then you’ll be better off and come off much more interesting. Put some more effort and actually be interested. If you can’t find yourself doing that after trying numerous times. Then you really need to put yourself out of your comfort zone by taking more risks. I suggest finding more hobbies, or speaking about your interests. You don’t necessarily have to do things to be interesting. If you like choreography for example but don’t do it, then talk about it. It’s great. And it can help you. 

But as a start, ask questions about the person. If they have a conversation with you, they’re doing it because they want to talk to YOU. If they start it, respond positively. Open up with something personal, but not so much that it’ll cross the line at work or elsewhere. People love talking about themselves. But, don’t make it forced, and don’t be selfish about it (selfish in the sense you’re only talking to this person to help yourself) and actually be interested in having a conversation with them. Maybe you’ll get a friend. If you don’t want that, just keep them as coworkers and only coworkers etc. Nothing more. 

For me, I have no problem talking to people, I can talk effortlessly. I’m just too awkward and hesitant to approach people because I’m not confident enough. But when I speak, I speak with confidence. Something I trained myself to do for a long time because I applied the thoughts I had in my head into conversations to make things interesting. Weird, I know.

I know a girl that is like what you mentioned but worse. Her face is so emotionless, and her voice is so monotone. She has nothing interesting to say. She is a textbook example of a lame/boring ass person. I hung out with her once and I was so bored I had to take her home. She has no conversation skills. And she sucked at talking about herself. But I think you have something going for you because you’re interesting enough to post on reddit but also have people go up to you. And lames can’t do that."
soc_891305,socialskills,reddit_comment,155,"Well then there must be at least a small spark of interest on their part or they won’t really listen to you or offer anything up and will look for the first opportunity to get away from you. 

Unless I’m stuck on a desert island with this person with no hope of rescue I’d rather spend my time with someone or something else. I’ve lost patience with people who don’t show an interest in other people and don’t even try to make conversation or be polite and open to others and I don’t want to waste my precious time trying to make them like me. I guess I just don’t give a shit anymore. 

If I’m at a cocktail party or some kind of social gathering I’ll find someone else to talk to. It’s a personal choice. If you want or need them to become interested in you then by all means, go for it!"
soc_200983,socialskills,reddit_comment,449,"well like i've said your appraoch doesn't matter if its genuine and with good intentions. and rejection itself won't be a scene, but you say you give no fucks about rejection so it would paly out ok. 


if i were you i'd stop waiting, this is advice form experience. waiting precipitates everything to build more anxiety than what it is the anticipation itself makes the task seem bigger than what it actually is. 

just to let you know there is not a perfect moment, trust me on that, there will never be a perfect moment for you to ask her out, whatever criteria you have on your mind of the ""perfect conditions"" to ask her out, they will not happen, you have to create them. 

since you rejected my advice i have to tell you the truth. there will never be a perfect time, nor perfect situation to ask her out, you like me knows that, the longer you wait the longer that anticipation and fear is going to build up and the more paralyzed you are going to be to take action. trust me i been there. 

so all i have to say is STOP thinking about the interaction, think ACTION. for once in your life you'd have to throw yourself into the fire, that being to literally walk up to her and ask her out. be willing to crash and burn, that being whatever outcome happens it will happen. 

stop thinking of the perfect scenario, perfect line, there is not a perfect line. 


trust me you are going to have to ask her out. so next time you see her you are going to walk up to her and be like ""hey (insert name), i know we barely talk but i think you are cute and i feel we should hang out some time to get to know each other"" then ask for her number. 

if she is with her friend, you are going to have to ask her to leave like ""hey xxx can you let me borrow ""insert name here"" for a couple seconds i need to tell her somthing"" if she doesn't fuck off then you are going to throw yourself into the fire with her friend in there. be upfront. 


whatever happens happens. 

if you aren't willing to take anybodies advice then why are you here for if you are going to make excuses anyway. 

why not just give in to your fear, and stop wasting my time, stop wasting your time, and stop wasting everybody elses time. after all your choice is made. 

if you aren't willing to take actoin what is the use, the best advice isn't going to help you."
soc_1664665,socialskills,reddit_comment,362,"I was too.

Honestly, lately I've been socializing with new people more and here's a harsh truth. One you need to hear:

- Some people will act nice when they meet you in person, but when you invite them out to do things via text or social media they will completely ignore you, and probably not even read your text. These people exist, let them be.
- Some people will ignore your invitation for a few days and respond a few days later, they needed to consider it. (After 3 days you should move on, especially if they have been online frequently)
- Never expect a reply from someone when you're attempting to build a friendship, truth be told most people won't reply.
- I do not recommend socializing with co-workers one on one outside of work. It causes drama, invite atleast 2 other co-workers, and don't always invite the same people. (Also applies to any other person you are forced to see again)
- If a co-worker or any other person for that matter does not take you up on your invitation or ignores you, don't hold a grudge against them, behave normally when you see them again and don't bring it up.
- It is bound to happen that you invite someone and they will completely ignore you, and follow up a week later texting they'd be interested, I would not advise going out with these people but that's up to you.

Some other pieces of advice/need to knows which prevent you from getting hurt:

- On social media new aqquaintances will often leave you on unread, meaning they have been online but didn't check your message, don't freak out, some people do this to remind them of the text later, but don't cling to that hope. Give them 3 days to respond, after that move on.
- Not everyone will like you.
- Be wary of befriending co-workers, there are alot of risks involved, never over-share.

Things I think will help you ease your mind. Invite people you think are nice quickly after meeting them, you will instantly know whether they are interested in your friendship by their reaction."
soc_286164,socialskills,reddit_comment,191,"Holding a grudge against another person is a red flag that you have a lot of work to do if you want to be a better person and a better communicator. It's ego, your ego. I can relate because I've had similar situations and walked down the same road. Making vows of cutting off others who don't seem to be pulling their weight in a relationship. I'll tell you that from personal experience...it's always a losing battle. The way I try my best to handle these situations now - I don't overextend myself in a relationship, I have a mature personal boundary (because if you are being taken advantage of it's up to you to say 'no' more and be more assertive), be compassionate and extremely forgiving, not expecting anything, focus on what is positive and not ruminating on negatives. These have seemed to bring more positive, high quality, mature people into my life. I only keep up with people who actively keep up with me and also try to meet new people often.

All you can do is derive your own happiness from your own efforts to go above and beyond your own SMO to try and promote and enjoy their happiness, because that is what makes you feel happy.  That is the true meaning of loving someone.  

Anything extra, above their SMO in an effort to promote and enjoy your happiness is a gift/bonus to you- their love of your happiness, their happiness in promoting and enjoying your happiness which also makes you feel joyful in seeing their happiness and joy- it becomes a circulation. 

Unrequited love can be painful, but the way to avoid it is not to be disappointed by it!  That's a tough sentence to read because of the negatives, so in other words: ""the expectation of love is a love-repellant"".  If you still arent feeling loved after some passage of time, it can be some tough feelings to go through but sometimes the timing, or the person, just isn't meant to be.  It's up to you to decide how to apply the principles of positive growth for yourself and others around you in a way that you feel comfortable with.

soc_1838104,socialskills,reddit_comment,219,"So I’m working on this as well but what I think works is this: After the small talk script, when I’m a little more relaxed, I try to open up a little. So to some I talk a little about what is currently driving me, for example that I would like to get out more and am looking for people to play Card games or pen and paper with. From my experience this deepens the connection with them, as they see you as a 3 dimensional person, that has issues and goals they are working on and not just some small talk robot. But you have to find a middle ground between complete openness “I’m really down and need to get out of my flat because I can’t stand it in there alone anymore” and the small talk. Finding this golden middle is not easy but if you do it right then it won’t be weird and you will have left the small talk behind. Also a good tip is being a strong listener when they tell you something about themselves that goes beyond small talk. Listen, ask questions, give the impression that you are interested and want to know more and leave the level of meaningless conversion to really talk with someone. But this is just my opinion…"
soc_1037435,socialskills,reddit_comment,568,"I read a lot of replies and agree with a lot of this, and/or find it enlightening.

For me personally, it wouldn’t matter - my boyfriend of 6 1/2 years had almost no dating / relationship experience before me, whereas I’ve been in relationships (including a marriage) since I was 17. So hopefully not everyone you encounter will judge you for this, or if at some point you meet someone you want to be with, it truly won’t be an issue for them. 

The only thing I’ll add, in an attempt to understand the response you keep getting or sensing, is this...in my experience (sorry, TW: this is heavy), even abusive people I’ve dated claimed they were ‘worse with a previous gf.’  That’s horrible but what I’m saying is, sometimes that pain and drama, as you call it, is what teaches someone to change an undesirable behavior (in the case of my ex, severe physical abuse with HIS ex...which I got a much softer version of, mostly just verbal abuse, thanks to him learning how destructive physical abuse was, by losing someone else he loved 6 years before he met me).

Yikes so heavy. Sorry. But I think caution and spidey-senses are sometimes something people don’t rationally understand...

I tend to give too many chances, and accept too many unacceptable things. It makes me lighthearted and kind, but also makes me naive to problems others seem to spot in advance (a.k.a. ‘red flags’)

So I say, don’t worry about it - your motives make sense to you, and I think avoiding drama can be wise. But ‘drama’ is also known as risk-reward/experience...so as others have said already, you may also be missing an experience to get to know yourself better, and see yourself thru the mirror of another person, reflecting you back to you (and you reflecting them to them). 

But only YOU know when you’re ready for that - if ever (you may not want that experience) - or, more likely, when the PERSON is the right person who makes it worth it for you.

I’d say every relationship I’ve had is as different as the person it was with.

So this idea of being in a relationship just to gain experience - as if relationships with any person are always the same concept called a ‘relationship’ resulting in the same life lessons - is as foolish as saying that the TYPE of food you eat doesn’t affect nutrition (it does!) so long as you eat something every day. A diet of only sugar and candy and soda, is very different food / sustenance than salad and veggies and nutrient-rich meals.  I think you’re accurately assessing that many relationships are like junk food addiction, and not worth the time. Waiting for something nourishing may be (is?) wisdom. Or not eating at all lol...

...okay this metaphor is falling apart haha, but body builders vs ascetic monks have very different dietary needs and preferences. And when it comes to relationships maybe you’re just more like the monk (little external input needed to thrive). 

Haha I’m new to reddit and don’t know when / how to stop. Bye!

Tl; dr - you do you, ignore the naysayers, but people sensing things (‘red flags’) is real, and we all have red flags on some topics, no one is ‘right for’ everyone, as a friend or partner or anything. Good luck!"

soc_172944,socialskills,reddit_comment,315,"I don't have any useful suggestions for what you actually want to do - that is, be respected by a group of people that you say have labeled you as socially awkward and who you feel you have lost the respect of because of that labelling. Since everyone is just saying, ""why do you even want to be friends with them?"", I'd like to add that the reason why they don't want to be friends with you may not be as simple as you think. There's no magic formula to making people like you and no one is automatically entitled to be friends with anyone else just because they want to be. If a group of people has communicated to you that they don't want to spend time with you, I don't think there's anyway to 'convince' them otherwise. Also, regarding being socially awkward/anxious, I don't think it's ever a matter of ""I was socially awkward/anxious and now I'm not anymore"".

I agree with everyone else who says just leave this group of people and don't try to force yourself on them socially - it's a universal social turn off and generally a 'socially awkward' thing to do. I would advise that you spend time learning more about yourself, your interests and your values, and learn to have more respect for yourself. It doesn't matter that you're 30 - people deal with social anxiety throughout their entire lives. Spending time around lots of different people and learning to focus more on learning about them will help take your focus away from how awkward you feel. Spending time with people who reject you will only exacerbate your feelings of awkwardness and social anxiety. Respecting yourself doesn't mean not trying to improve yourself, it means improving yourself so you come closer to being your best self in your own eyes rather than chasing after other people's approval."
soc_912055,socialskills,reddit_comment,229,"I am sorry you are hurting. Consider that this is a challenging time for a lot of people, so if your friends have changed their behaviors, it may have nothing to do with you. You have a better sense of what’s going on in your life, but if this is not a change in behaviors, here are some thoughts... Feelings are neither right nor wrong, but feelings that you are meaningless or worthless are not healthy for you, so try to be kind to yourself. Once I felt similarly, I think. I felt as if I had to initiate every interaction with my friends otherwise I wouldn’t hear from them. I did a lot for people, and I started to think people didn’t care for me as a person, but they enjoyed the things I did for them. They liked that I was dependable, and I started to have feelings of resentment, which were really misplaced. I took a break, and spent time doing things I enjoyed. Once decided that no one owes me anything, and I stopped expecting so much from people, I was transformed. I expected nothing and was so grateful for the simple courtesies. I still do good turns, but I do them only with a full heart and understanding that it may not be reciprocated. You may find you just need better friends! Best wishes!"
soc_1713162,socialskills,reddit_comment,199,"Yes and no. For me, I really enjoyed going out partying (not every week, but often). Getting super drunk, flirting a bit and just having fun. That's a very crusial time in my life that I wouldn't have wanted to miss out on. 

However, I'm not for casual sex. I have done it, but it's just not as good. It's so much better when you're in love with someone. 

But everyone is different and I'm 24 now and sometimes when I still go out I think, what am I doing here? It's fun, but I just enjoy it a lot less than I used to. So I don't know if you'd still enjoy it or would've ever enjoyed it. 

If you don't see any needs to have casual sex, then you don't have to do it. It's not something that you have to do in order to have a fulfilling life imo. For some it does, for others it doesn't.

But I would go out once and not be so careful. Just live a little and if you end up with someone, then that's cool. But don't make it your mission. Just make it your mission to have fun."

It’s a longish story, but I eventually reconciled with the friend I mentioned in that comment. He never apologized for ignoring me but did acknowledge that “we hadn’t really talked for the last couple of years.” I forgave him (in my head) because he was going through a tough time and moving to the other side of the country and I thought I would never see him again.

To explain, people form opinions about you by themselves. It is not up to you whether that perception changes. The change will occur when (1) they are receptive to change, (2) when you act in a way that goes counter to their perception, and (3) when they are around to see it.

The best thing you can do is constantly be a better man, and to always act as the best version of yourself, even if nobody is watching. Because you will never know when someone is watching.

And trust me, if you are positive, have self confidence, is respectful, and is considerate. You will get many friends. Even if you are into the weirdest kink. "
soc_268885,socialskills,reddit_comment,479,"General points already made that are good: speak more plainly because your words sound like a scalpel next to everyone else's butterknife, accept compliments and move on, don't feel ashamed of your gift, don't lie, and probably stop self-depreciating so much.

A couple points are worth noting. People, myself included, unintentionally take things they see and hear and alter it based on their own personalities. Sometimes self-depreciating humor gets a chuckle, sometimes it leaves a person feeling insulted. This isn't news to you, but you should try to get a feel for how people's perspectives can be categorized by the way they react to different things you say and do. No one can tell you how to mesh with others because no one else is you. 

When it comes to conversation in general, it sounds like everything in a 'get to know you' type conversation comes back to intelligence. My guess? Your intellect is like a giant statue standing behind you. You used to boast to everyone about the giant statue, forcing them to compare themselves to you. Now, you've thrown a giant white sheet over the statue that towers over you. Naturally, conversation drifts back towards the giant covered statue. You try to cover it up and insist that you don't talk about it or insist to others that it isn't so large, but, no matter what, it feels like conversation will always be drawn to the giant statue that is your academic success. Practice leading conversation in a walk away from the statue. 

When you focus on keeping the conversation away from it, it's like checking to make sure the sheet is fully covering it. That won't keep conversation off of what's underneath for long. 

Your personality is a garden, walk away from the statue. If a younger schoolmate starts talking about their intelligence, listen, ask questions, etc., don't try to avoid theirs or you'll end up at yours. If a direct question is asked about yours, just say you've talked about school enough lately and you don't want to think about it. Maybe ask them to help keep your mind off of it for a while, people like to feel helpful. 

To do this effectively, you'll have to develop a genuine interest in talking about other stuff, instead of thinking about other stuff as a way to avoid your intelligence. 

Positive (towards) focus AND negative (away) focus, will always lead back towards where the focus lies, whether you want it to or not. The best way out is to shift the center of focus elsewhere. The easiest place to start is the other person. With practice, you'll be able to talk to others about yourself while keeping the giant statue out of sight until you're ready to talk about it.

You can't force a connection -- I think this is the main thing. A lot of people you will find are going to fake niceness because that's how the world is. People want to seem happy. But when you engage with someone with curiosity and go beyond the fakeness and the surface-level BS. Then you can get into flow-state with them; get lost in convo which becomes very enjoyable.

So simply the experience together --- is much more important than the labels. Friendship is developed from a genuinely good time with the other, not from asking or wanting someone to be your friend... Act as if they already are! \*

Acting like people around you are already *potential* friends would help a lot.

Also, befriend yourself through this process. Learn from the not so enjoyable interactions and move on. 

You will get rejected by some no matter what and it's up to you to learn how not to take that personally. It's up to you to initiate and take charge in creating new and hopefully long and fulfilling friendships."

When she makes an unreasonable request, you do what you've been doing: ""I can't do that, and here's why."" When she gets angry, you just name the emotion and repeat what you said: ""I understand that you're angry with me, but here's why I can't do that."" And if she threatens to break off contact with you, you say something like ""It's certainly your choice if you want to do that, but I still can't give you the help you're asking for."" Then, you wait. If she cools off and wants contact again, you can make the call whether the risk of future aggravation is worth answering it. I've found that when I successfully stand my ground two or three times, my friends tend to get the message and not make boundary-crossing requests anymore."

soc_414421,socialskills,reddit_comment,207,"This comes down to your judgement. Do you feel that the other person has made a sincere effort to regain your friendship, or are they just taking advantage of you by asking favors. 

If you feel that they want you to be a friend, go for it. 

If they are just using you, let it go. 

There is no reason to feel guilty. Friends come and go, and arguments happen. This situation is 100&amp;#37; up to you and you alone. Nobody on reddit can make this choice for you, and there is no shame in whatever route you take. 

Another possibility is not talking to her, but being open if she sincerely comes to you looking for a friendship. This is sometimes ideal because if she doesn't come back, then you know the friendship wasn't meant to be. If she does, great! Be friends again. 

One more angle to consider is the argument. Was this argument your fault, hers, or both parties? If it was your fault, I would lean towards you trying to make it up. If it was hers, then she should be doing most of the work. If it is mutual, you can make that decision.

soc_700539,socialskills,reddit_comment,317,"&gt; What do you mean with the expression of someone else's self? ELI5 please

When you were little, you were told you were special. Being special meant you had traits about you which naturally came from you that were part of your personality, your attitude, your whole self. They could be that others saw you as patient, caring, empathetic, nice, friendly, whatever. 

When you interact with life, and other people in it, you have unique ways in which you respond to situations you're faced with based on these traits. For instance if someone you dont know comes up to you and says hi, you will smile, say hi back, and ask what their name is. That's you expressing the friendly part of your self. These are ELI5 versions of self and behaviors from self.

&amp;nbsp;

Just as you express the attributes that make up your self when you interact with other people, and just as you have a right to express yourself when you interact with other people...so too do other people express *their* self when they interact with you...and they have a right to express themselves as well. Part of the vulnerability idea I speak of is empathizing that everyone else has a self, and expresses that self. Just as you have a self, and you express yourself.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; I also don't understand the part of letting hate in. You've been rejected not hated.

In this instance OP is speaking about rejection (which...he really didnt even get rejected...but that's a different issue). Expanding on the idea of letting rejection in though...the path to vulnerability and being okay with other people expressing themselves that I'm speaking of entails letting all kinds of things in. From rejection, to hatred, to sadness, to happiness, love, euphoria, anything. 

So I'm hinting at a lesson about a bigger perspective shift than what OP needs to deal with this one scenario."

soc_1543410,socialskills,reddit_comment,344,"Also don't discount the value of true friendship. A girlfriend is nice, but if you pour all of your time in her and she say, gets sick or something, that could be a horrible hit to your confidence. My suggestions:

1) Your passion is C++? Study that, it's a great hobby. (Coming from the cybersecurity major).

2) Keep in mind the circle you are in now will not be the circle you are in a couple of years. Your in high school I am assuming? If so, you will graduate in a couple of years and either attend college or go to work (I highly recommend college). In either one you will find groups of like minded people who get you. Watch this video -&gt; [https://youtu.be/y3FaqmUD4Ew](https://youtu.be/y3FaqmUD4Ew)

3) Your 5 best friends now will determine who you are in five years. Choose your friends wisely. 

4) Put as much effort into your self care as you can muster. By being your best self you will attract the people who appreciate you and are like minded. This means eating healthy, lots of water, abstaining from pornography, alcohol, and drugs, reading as much as you can about your passions, financial literacy, and the arts, exercising daily, whether it be the gym or body weight exercises at home, getting your time management straight, getting as close to the right amount of sleep as you can (everyone is different), etc. Prioritize your time, your health, and your mental well being and the rest will fall into place.

5) If your friends would go so far as to steal money from you (even if you were mean to them) the are not, never have been, and never should be your friends.

6) Always lead with kindness. Don't shout at these individuals, be polite and move on. Even if you are not a Christian, just take a look at how Jesus handled the pharisees and the other individuals who attacked him. Humble admonishment, or in other words be a gentle bulldozer.

Hope that helps.

soc_1075518,socialskills,reddit_comment,863,"You're never too far gone dude.

Honestly just the fact that you can recognize you went a little overboard there is a great sign.  

&gt; This might not sound right to you, but the most toxic people in my life have been my family (especially my mother) and it's impossible to cut them off. 

A share of people have toxic parents, you can read a lot of their experiences on reddit.  There's two ways to handle them.

1. Cut them out completely.  This is generally the best way but it's also a huge step that most people would not feel comfortable taking.  It's pretty difficult to pull the trigger on this decision.
2. Keep them at an arm's distance.  Keep them in contact just as much as you need to.  Avoid them as much as possible.  Insist on most communication thru text.  Text is better in that you can answer when you want to answer and waiting allows you to answer when your emotions aren't so high.  If you need to visit, when you get there, tell them ""oh, I gotta go at (X) time for (something)"".  Set an alarm on your phone and when it goes off, excuse yourself and leave.  The less time you spend in contact with them, the less their toxicity can infect you.

You really don't have to be alone, dude.  Don't resign yourself to it.  If you want some advice I'd do this:

1. Work on cutting off toxic people or pushing toxic people as far away as you can.
2. Work on yourself physically.  Start to work out more, start to pick up sports, start to pick up more physical activity.  There's a ton of reasons for this.  It's good for your health.  It's good for your self esteem (the better shape you are in the better you look).  And... (point 4 below).
3. Work on yourself emotionally.  Learn to like yourself.  Learn to try to see the world in a better light.  Look at your bad habits, tendencies that might push away cool people and try to get rid of them.  Look at the things people you think are good people do and see if you can do them to.  Be it small talk, be it becoming a better listener, be it their approach to problems and conflict.  
4. Put yourself out there.  This is tough to do now with the pandemic, but get out there and meet people. Now if you've been doing #2 above like picking up a sport, or an outdoor activity, then that's good ways to meet people.  Group hikes, camping trips, basketball clubs, tennis lessons, jogging groups, crossfit, martial arts.  Really easy to be put into groups and have something to do together.  Otherwise, find (ideally local) groups covering things that interest you.  Try online dating, or online friends.
5. Prepare for disappointment - making friends takes time and you WILL run into toxic people.  You will run into flakes.  Most commonly you'll run into people who want different levels of friendship than you.   For example, you might meet someone that's awesome and you could totally be best friends with, but that person might already have like 10 close friends and another 50 friends and while you and that guy get along great, you wouldn't into his group of 10 close friends so you're gonna be regulated down to the 51st normal friend.  Don't be bitter about it.  It's just the way things are.  Keep them as a more distant friend and continue on your search for a close friend.  Having a group of more distant friends isn't a bad thing. You might get invited to a group hangout and you might meet other people that you get along great with.  Distant friends are people you hit up every now and then to see how they're doing and maybe grab lunch/dinner here and there.
6. Don't let yourself be taken advantage of.  Yes, in the beginning if you're the one seeking the friendship, you're gonna have to do most of the work.  You're going to have to be the nicer one and put more effort.  So at the start expect to be putting a lot more effort in, doing more favors (never do big favors do minor ones; don't lend money but you can occasionally treat for lunch/dinner if it's cheaper) than getting them, etc in the start of the possibly budding friendship.  But after a period of time (your choice how long but should at least be a couple of months) judge how it's going.  Especially with favors - start to ask yourself ""would this person do this favor for me?""  If the answer is no - don't do them that favor.  If they flake on responding to you often or almost never initiate, throw them in the distant friend pile. If they're always fast and reliable to answer though even if they don't initiate keep them around.
7. Don't use social media as social media.  You can add people on Facebook/Instagram as a way to contact them, but don't check it because Social Media tends to make you feel lonelier.

Seriously dude, best of luck.  Don't give up."

You said she asks stupid questions. Do you have attitude when you answer? Are you calling her names? What are you doing? 

I also have a coworker that doesn't think at all. He asks a hundred stupid questions a night. I tried being nice at first then I was a little snippy now I might be a little rude and condescending but I ask him his question back to see if he knows the answer and show him how stupid it sounds. 

They say there are no stupid questions which is true to a degree. If you legitimately don't know the answer and are trying gain insight then it's not stupid no matter how simple it may seem to the person you're asking. If it's something you could figure out if you thought about it for two seconds then it is a stupid question and I'm not sorry.

soc_53004,socialskills,reddit_comment,150,"I think it's important to keep in mind that you are going to need to do the legwork to hook up with new friends. To meet people with similar interests go to social events that center on or are tangential to those things you are interested in. Search out groups in your area. They don't come to you. They may not be big on broadcasting themselves either. If you like manga, then go to the local shop and talk to the shopkeeper. Let him know you're new and see who (s)he knows. If you seem like a decent guy then (s)he may just invite you to their social circle. 

Everyone is entitled to their own interests and your's are perfectly valid, but as somebody else said, it may be good to get into some activities that lend themselves to creating social connections and avoid ones that seclude or isolate participants."

soc_747726,socialskills,reddit_comment,296,"I'm speaking from the perspective of someone who is just like this. I'm very shy and tend not be very forward with someone. Whenever I get asked out, I'll often say I'm not interested because I get overwhelmed and don't expect it, and after that I start considering and playing with the idea. Eventually I'd make an effort to reach out if I was interested, typically just small talk and short texts. At least that's what I did at the beginning, but I've realized it's not the most efficient way because people tend to move on when you reject them. Though I've gotten better at reading signs over the last year since I've become more socially active and experienced, so I rarely get overwhelmed now.

And I'm not proposing a drawn out plan over an extended time period. I'm simply suggesting you ask him on a date, which is natural when you're interested in eachother, and talk about more meaningful things to send signals of your interest. Smoking together just the two of you does the trick, it's easy to get out of if it becomes awkward. As the conversation throttles along, he'll start to be more confident that his feelings are reciprocated and he won't be as overwhelmed once you inevitably breaks the news to him.

At the end of the day, you can do what you want. Little effort, or actual effort. Text or date. It's your choice. A date is generally safer, and if it doesn't work out then he simply isn't interested in you and you thought incorrectly. It'll save you both an awkward interaction once you inevitably hang out after you've been texting and not really been able to talk things through properly. Just my... 4 cents now, I suppose. :P"
soc_1178790,socialskills,reddit_comment,187,"I would not bring it up unless she is discussing her mental struggles with you. Then you can naturally work it into the conversation that perhaps she see a doctor because her struggles sound similar to the struggles of people with BPD. 

I also don't recommend dating someone with BPD (no offense to those struggling with BPD, but honestly, you must know how much work you are, right?). It's one thing if you fall in love and then discover this, but if you're still in the getting to know each other phase, you're asking for a lot of drama, and probable heartbreak. Of course everyone is different and some people are better at doing the work everyday, but they may not be able to keep that up, always. It's not like alcoholism where you just need to focus on avoiding drugs and alcohol, or depression where you can take meds that fix it over time. It's a life long struggle. It's a rough illness to put up with in a partner and a much rougher one to live with. 

Just my opinion though. Good luck with everything."

-Having a dog helped me a lot. Because i must go outside if i want or not. (maybe a side job as a dog sitter)

-Making Plans before I go outside. What do i want outside? Which train do i need? How long is the way to my destination? Organizing me being outside. 

-Trying. If you want to join a club, do it. And if you don't feel well while doing it you still can stop. You decide how far you go. That really important for me. I decide my limits. 

-Looking at something i like. What calms me down is watching the sky and nature around me. It's therapeutic for me.

-Everyone has the same goal: to get better. They are all there for Personal Development.
-They are a VERY supportive group of people. Remember everyone is there to get better.
-Your participation for the first few meetings is up to you. If you want to get involved or get your first speech underway more quickly, simply ask and they'll take care of you.
-Each meeting should last about an hour
-There is impromptu speaking practice (only if you're willing) and usually two speakers each meeting

soc_346902,socialskills,reddit_comment,312,"I'd like to ask you a question if you don't mind:

* Let's say that you don't have this fear of girls rejecting you for your ""low social status"" or desire to find a girl at all. Would you still have a goal of making friends? Or is making friends more of a stepping-stone goal in order to find romance? 

Another thing to consider is that making more and more friends is a good way to find that special someone. A friend could introduce you to a single female friend, for instance. Just pragmatically, it's going to be harder to exclusively find a girl without a social circle. 

&gt; To point number two, what gave that away?

I saw a lot of myself in your post and  I figured maybe you just needed to learn the same lesson I did ( still am ). It's not like there's some glaringly obvious window to it. :P

***

You have a lot of things to be thankful / proud of. You have the strength of character to put yourself through self-betterment, be proud of that. You're ( presumably ) physically attractive as evident by those ""porn eyes"", give yourself a pat on the back for that. From what I can tell, you're a well-spoken and a nice guy overall. You have a lot of positives man, make sure you're not forgetting that.

With the low social status, it's up to you to decide how much of a negative it is. If it really is bothering you directly, than what's been stopping you from making friends?


This is somewhat of a deep topic, at least for me. I'm exploring a lot of my own thoughts as I write this as well. I'm not some social guru by any means; I'm trying to figure things out for myself too :P

soc_912041,socialskills,reddit_comment,367,"I'm sorry to hear that, friend. I experienced similar invalidation in my childhood as well, and I can definitely attest to the self doubt/social anxiety that I still struggle with as a result.

Childhood years are our most formative, and when a child's ideas are repeatedly rejected, invalidated, or downright ignored by their family, it has detrimental effects on their self-respect and social capability well into adulthood. Maybe it wasn't outwardly hostile, violent, or a direct threat to your safety, but it can even still be classified as trauma. Young children need two things from their guardians: love and protection. When a child feels that one or both of those needs is not being met, the child then becomes who they feel they need to be to receive that unmet need, which is a hugely common denominator in mental/social disorders in adults. 


(disclaimer: please don't take this as a direct criticism of your parents/siblings. we are all imperfect humans, often unaware of the lasting effects that our words/actions could have, and i'm sure they're good people.)


In your case, it sounds like your opinion was brushed off or invalidated so many times as a child that you became someone who does not offer their opinion unless specifically asked, and in turn, you now feel guilty when giving any unsolicited input. This is a completely natural and human reaction to the childhood environment that you've described.

However, it's now up to you to work through these inclinations you have, for your own best interest. Know that your opinion is not inherently wrong, irrelevant, or unwarranted. Be patient and kind to yourself, and try to work on building your confidence by talking to people about whatever you deem worthy of discussion. Feelings of guilt will arise, but understand that it is essentially just your psyche clinging to an early survival tactic, and that while your feelings are 100% valid, there is no real reason to subject yourself to that guilt any longer. 

You will find that people do want to hear what you have to say, when you want to say it, and slowly but surely, your confidence will grow.

I hope this insight was helpful, friend. Best wishes"
soc_648851,socialskills,reddit_comment,166,"I think it's important to distinguish between opinions and facts.  Your post reminds me of someone I know, who thinks that ""those curtains should be blue"" is a fact.  Facts are things like 2+2=4.  Opinions are things like ""this roleplay should be done this way"".

John Gottman talks about something called ""accepting influence"", and basically, it means to really consider the other person's point, then form your opinion from there.  If the only input you get is your own, you're missing a lot.  Groups generally run best on consensus.  If you want a friend group, they're not going to put up with you deciding, without input, what's best.  (At least, not for long.)

In short, you need to decide whether or not you want to be ""right"" or liked.  Clearly, your way of handling relationships is not working.  I think you'd do a lot better if you stopped with ""it's gonna be my way"" and started with ""how can we do this so we're both happy?"""

soc_809937,socialskills,reddit_comment,493,"I am noticing a lot of overthinking, and some that I don’t think you’ve realized have formed false, seemingly deeply rooted, beliefs.

But first, I’m sorry you are struggling with anxiety, and have had to deal with a hurtful parent. That is genuinely hard, and it’s awesome that you are becoming more aware and want to change this about yourself.

Now, some general things everyone can use a refresher on sometimes:

hanging onto other people won’t ever make you feel less lonely. It’s true to some extent that we need some social interaction, and introverts crave less frequent, but more “deep” social interactions that can be harder to come by, but the truth is that when you’re trying to prolong contact with friends, you’re just distracting yourself from loneliness, not feeling less lonely. Your loneliness is not externally induced, but rather coming from a place of lack of self-acceptance. There is then a resulting anxiety that fills in the blanks of how to externally obtain that, when in reality, you just need to be better at being there for you to feel less lonely. Do you like yourself? Do you feel comfortable with yourself? Do you feel like you know who you are as a person? — start there. 

You can’t control how other people perceive you. There is absolutely nothing you can do to be a perfect friend, or “make” somebody like you. They either will or they won’t. Did that sink in? I just want to emphasize: Changing yourself, trying super hard, draining your energy, etc is a waste of time and won’t change anybody’s mind. Who you are as a person isn’t dependent on those shallow things and real friends want to be friends with the real you, and humans are good at detecting whether or not something feels genuine. — Really, all that matters is that you have good intentions, and you’re treating them kindly. 

For the record, you are not trapped. Even if you have to go to the next town over, I promise you can go to therapy and you can request a different therapist at the clinic. And if you really don’t want to, there are licensed therapists online that you can have sessions with over the phone, or through messaging. All of this in both cases are all governed by HIPPA. In short, it basically means it is a big fat crime for a therapist to share any information about you—nobody has to know you’re gay if you don’t want them to! Which btw, fuck them if they don’t accept you! You are 100% as valid and important as anybody else! You deserve to feel and express your attraction and love the same way everybody else does! 

Also, In my personal opinion, the Bible will just leave you more lonely. 

I hope you feel better. You deserve happiness, kindness, acceptance and peace. I challenge you to offer that to yourself, and others! 

Best of luck."

I've definitely noticed in the past when she just stops replying for a while but then comes back and treats everything like normal. I don't count out the fact that she's busy, and I also don't count out the possibility that people just talk less and less to each other the more they know about each other. It's just human nature. And then there's the change of priorities.  That's just life. But after what she told me I definitely think she's been distancing, and if the past is any indication, she's going to distance from the chat even more now.

Is there any hope to redeem this? I guess everyone is different but in general if a woman starts distancing herself from a guy what are the chances that things will get better especially if we have never seen each other in real life?"
soc_225451,socialskills,reddit_comment,346,"&gt; she should be happy you decided to talk to her because you like her looks and she should not have anything better to do than to talk to you

There is no assumption that she should be happy, or feel any particular emotion.

The perspective is thus: you consider yourself a good person? You make others laugh, or you are very kind, or perhaps you are a fantastic listener. You do interesting things and have interesting ideas. You are a healthy, social person. If you think this about yourself, why would you *not* want to share that with others? In fact, it would be rude of you *not* to do this because you are genuinely interested in making others feel good and be happy.

&gt;a friendly conversation between strangers without an ulterior motive doesn't happpen. No one talks to strangers just for the fun of it, it always has a purpose, so when someone comes up to me like that without giving any context, I am already suspicious.

I think the difference is in fact cultural. The US is known for an atmosphere of social outgoingness and strangers converse constantly. Europe, particularly northern and eastern, is very much not like that (from what limited amounts I have heard and read from others).

So, at least in the US, strangers have conversations literally every day about any old thing. Lots of people just like to interact with others and feel connected in that way. I suppose Germany is probably not at all like that. 

All I would say is, consider what I have been saying, and please believe that I am being fully honest. The perspective that strangers who strike up a conversation just want something from you is just that - a perspective. Not universal law. I'm not saying you should change, necessarily, but simply keep in mind that humans are social animals, and that your (and my) attitudes towards the appropriateness of random conversations is hugely based on our cultural upbringing. Neither of us is right or wrong, we just have different perspectives :)"
soc_116370,socialskills,reddit_comment,170,"Asking about the actual situation and standing for a person who is not here is called sexist? I would consider ensuring both sides have been equally represented as equality. But go ahead call me all you want.
As a woman, society will always consider you to be correct just because you said so.

Also, this maybe nitpicking but women usually do not stay as FWB after a breakup with the same person and then say that he treated her badly. I find the situation unsettling. So, I asked questions? If the questions seem particularly abrasive, so be it.

As for advice, I stick to my previous one. Get new friends. If it is a political org then I am sure there are branches and locations other than the one you 2 frequented together. If the ideology/politics is important to you move to a different location. If the people are important. at least do not meet the same people while he is around. Get together at a place of your choice."
soc_16542,socialskills,reddit_comment,886,"I find that correcting people when they're wrong is subjective to quite a lot of things. To name a few, the magnitude of their flawed argument (ask yourself:how wrong are they?), the manner in which they present it (perhaps they are yelling at someone, perhaps it's a Facebook status, tweet, or comment on a blog), how much they seem to rely on whatever information they are citing (they could be in a desperate state, in which case, you should be ever more cautious), etc.

Whenever I hear someone stating wrong information, I always try to correct them firmly but gently, in terms of manner. I also like to enter into a counterargument by saying something like:
 ""I'm not saying I am disagreeing with you, but why do you believe that? Just curious.""
 This not only informs them that they are entering into a debate with an open-minded person, but lets them know that their opinion matters. If it's really wrong, their answer to this question will soon show really how uninformed their opinion is. I then try to enter them into some sort of a logic loop, or a ""well what if you were in their shoes?"" type of question. See what they say, I personally love hearing people's opinions, no matter how wrong they may be. Then comes the kicker: actually telling them what the right answer is. They have their flawed sources, you hopefully have better ones (and make sure its a good one, or else you lose credibility). You don't want to seem ""better"" than them because, even for the most tolerant opponents, saying something like ""I'm right, you're wrong"" is practically a ""fuck you"", so don't ever try to sound like that. Rather, say something like this:
 ""Hmm, interesting. When I was in high school, I distinctly remember learning....""
This way, you are not only putting them next to you, but you are also gently approaching an opposing argument. In addition, by saying something like ""I can respect that"" or ""interesting"", you are acknowledging their opinion which is just a simple but effective courtesy. 

Of course, some people just in general CAN'T be corrected. I find this happen especially in philosophical or political discussions; you have to go way out of your way to reach a plethora of facts. With philosophy, and I may be wrong, there really isn't one right or wrong answer, unless the opponent incorrectly paraphrased the author of a text or something. In opposition to philosophical arguments, I usually say something like: 
""this is just my opinion, but....""
Political discussion is notoriously difficult because people tend to pour all their faith into one side of the argument--one party---and shun the rest. Of course, this isn't universal, but its normal, and I find it hard sometimes to enter into these discussions without arousing at least some level of discontent, in which case I either back out or say a neutral comment to let them know I acknowledge their opinion. Politics are stressful--I'm still learning how to deal with them and I'm sure our government (I'm from the US) could get a lot more done if they learned how to speak to each other.

If this is something that could harm someone else, it is ESPECIALLY important that you let them know they are wrong. The point is to prevent as much harm possible. Especially with relationship shit, like if a guy comes up to you and says ""My girlfriend's being a bitch. She won't text me back and every text I do get is only a word long. I'm really pissed and am gonna yell at her.""
Of course, that would be a bitch move on the girl's part, but yelling could erupt into something worse, like abuse. We don't want that. Try letting your friend know: 
""yeah it sounds like she's being a bitch, but honestly, if you really care about her, yelling isn't going to do much. Obviously something is up, and you don't want to make matters worse. Why not try straight-up asking her to meet you and talk, then calmly ask why she hasn't been communicating?"" 
With matters like these, correction must be quick but steady. Again, nothing that says ""I'm right, you're wrong, fuck you."" We don't want harm to come to anyone, and reassuring them that they are wrong and could actually cause harm is very important. 

But anyways, key points:
1.Approach gently but firmly (""just curious, but why do you think that?"") Get their opinion
2. Help them understand that there is at least a little bit of flaw in their idea (""Don't you think...?"" ""What if....?"")
3. Provide modest insight (""I read a book by a professional that said this..."")
4. See if they admit their wrong. If so, give them a pat on the back and reaffirm that its alright. If not, try repeating step 2.
Arguing can be both detrimental and foundational to good relationships and friendships. It's essential that you are able to communicate not just well, but genuinely and honestly with friends, family, and loved ones.

TL;DR: Don't be a dick. Let them know you're open for discussion and try learning more about them in the process. Then, cite your opinion and source, but modestly. The point is to not seem above the opponent in this case. "

I will give OP some advice based on direct life experience. I have more or less had the experience of being in some ways betrayed my 2 close people though maybe they probably think I betrayed them. It's funny how narratives work. 

1. Find a therapist and specifically focus on the parts of yourself that you want to work on or any baggage you carry to process that. 
2. I would say at least 75 percent of people are not good people. They might be bad altogether but it's like having an apple with blemishes which isn't great. What that means is you gotta become a top 25 percenter and hopefully a even higher in terms of how you are as a person. 
3. Generally speaking if an opportunity is mostly good but carries some risk one should take it and still be watchful, set boundaries, or enforce their will when necessary. If it's 70 percent promising 30 percent risk one should go for it more or less. 
4. Communicating is more important than being right and that's a big marker for if you or someone will do something to fuck someone over. They will prioritize perceived facts which they perceive as objective overlooking the power dynamics at play which are perceived as subjective. I have found that the dynamics matter far more then the perceived facts but that's cuz we find it difficult to see our bias or how that affects the whole context for our interactions.


I personally think that red flags do exist but many times they are somewhat a myth in the sense that all people have them for instance on one's own failing to acknowledge ones own red flags. When one checks their own red flags it's a bit easier since you wont walk into relationships blind. All people have flags but the important thing is to acknowledge them, grow, learn, and change. In some ways people who don't hide their red flags/mistakes and weaknesses are much more trustworthy than someone who you assume has none. 

The most trustworthy people I have met as of yet all have the common phrase which is don't trust me or don't have faith in me and see for yourself. 


The best advice I ever applied was the reversal of advice which most people don't like to here because it is hardcore. 

Advice
------------
Sometimes people focus on trying to work through their issues by creating conditions to setup their success or their failure. Sometimes people rework the story about themselves to help the move forward. 


There is another option though it's not something one really applies but more something that may or may not happen spontaneously if one gets lucky or has some conditions setup for themselves. The idea is simply put to drop the narrative altogether though that's easier said than done. 



On quotes 
------------------

If you've ever watched attack on Titan there is a cool quote Levi gives and I paraphrase. I don't know the right answer and I never really have. I just accumulated battle experience and after enough battles here I stand ready to fight another day. Just because something worked in the past doesn't mean it will work now. So you have to decide Eren who you can trust whether yourself, survey corps, or me. 

He is supposed to be humanities strongest fighter but even that is not a guarantee. 

As such I draw the conclusion to more or less go since it seems whatever choice I make doesn't gurantee anything anyways. It seems bleak at first but it's actually a little freeing because I can still put effort and accumulate life experience to help but in the long run it's hard to control chaos. Do your best regardless and live to fight another day."
soc_1289528,socialskills,reddit_comment,306,"For one, remember that their opinion literally does nothing to you or for you. So if they don't like you, oh well. They don't even know you. You don't have to respond or retort to their immaturity. Just keep on moving. You said it yourself, you look good. You are about to be off into the world of adults, they are children still. Just because some 14 year old girls have bad taste you can't go doubting yourself. 

As for the rumors, not giving the rumor the time of day is a good way to deal with it. Kids try to use rumors and your insecurities against you, but remember that it's just a rumor. You and those who matter in your world know that it's just a rumor. You getting bent out of shape over it is precisely the reaction that they were hoping to get and would prompt them to continue to try to ruffle your feathers. Bullies want the reaction. When they see that you aren't an easy target, they are likely to move on to easier targets. Getting defensive is almost just as bad as saying that the rumor is true. They think that because you are getting so upset about it  that it must be true. If you learn to ignore it until it's in your face, then laugh about it you'll see that these sort of things stop. 

For instance, someone comes up to you and tells you that they heard a rumor about you, just laugh and say something like ""oh no, what have I been getting up to this time?"" I've heard some rumors about myself back in high school that you just have to laugh about. Like, wow, I didn't know that I was that much of a badass! Or oh jeez, I'm such a dick! lmao"

Look at Naruto who initially had no contact with girls/humans at all, look at Kaneki what he went through, look at Yukine who nobody could see (because he is invisible). It might sound weird, but all these characters mentioned have had to go through a lot and each of them found a happy ending in different ways.

To close with someone you feel like you've run out of time with a simple ""sorry I'm going to have to cut you off I have ___ I need to attend to thanks for ___ "" should be appropriate for most occasions.

I have a lot of fun with phone talks that are not very personal with bankers or telemarketers for instance where I'll holler at a woman across the line and act all flirty.

Attract people – Is it that difficult?

Let’s see how you can attract people out there.

You can attract anybody; it depends on you how you want to attract people towards you. There are two ways of drawing people’s attention- First, you can act like a gentleman and attract people with your good deeds. Second, you can be a joker in the crowd and do silly things to attract people.

In this article, I will tell you the way of attracting people by your positive behavior instead of being a jerk. That’s entirely your call what you are putting out in a public domain. So, let’s begin.

#### 1. Being Kind Never goes Old

If you are kind and nice to people, you will always attract a lot of people towards you. As being kind and humble to everyone is not that easy these days because then people take you for granted. But still, you should not change this behavior of respecting people and being kind to them.

#### 2. Always Wear a Smile on your Face

A smile is a thing that will do the work. Smile captivates people’s attention. You always need to wear a smile because interacting with somebody without smile always reflects a sense of negativity in you and builds a [bad impression](https://personalitydevelopmentcourse.com/how-to-change-your-bad-impression/). And, if you are smiling, then more people will be attracted towards you and you will able to spread much more positivity.

#### 3. Attire

Your attire plays a very important role in attracting someone. Everybody will get attracted to u when you are in a nice attire pristine and hygiene; it always releases positive vibes. Attire makes you feel confident about yourself. As a result, people feel a bond of attraction towards you. People would love to interact seeing your confident personality.

If you want to look more confident, then read [Gain Confidence to boost your personality](https://personalitydevelopmentcourse.com/gain-confidence-to-boost-your-personality/)"
soc_69385,socialskills,reddit_comment,295,"To answer you question, no it is not strange to ask someone to hangout. That is what friends do. Getting to the point where it is enjoyable to hangout with someone can take time, especially when its only two people. Trying to join in with other groups is one of the easiest ways to build relationships with people.

If the group setting isn't an option, try finding people with mutual interests in something you enjoy and then ask them to go/do whatever that may be with you. Doing something with someone should help build a relationship with that person and can make going out for food or drinks easier. Think about the first time hanging out with someone outside of work or school, it can be a little weird since you don't have that much to talk about right off the bat. Finding out that you enjoy something that someone else also enjoys at least gives you something to talk about and can make spending time with someone more enjoyable.

Second, the internet is a whole other thing. Talking to someone online is ok for a lot of people but a real life friendship or relationship that starts out on the internet is weird to some people. Keep trying though, everyone is different.

Also if someone avoids trying to hangout with you multiple times, either let them initiate spending time with you next or don't bother. People who care and want to make time for you won't keep making excuses. Not that you should have a fuck everyone that doesn't like me kind of attitude. I talk to people almost everyday that I wouldn't hangout with outside of work or school just because I don't feel like they are relatable to me. 

Hope this helps."
soc_1136528,socialskills,reddit_comment,165,"Do you remember who brought up the subject of reddit? Or who mentioned they use reddit?

You could ask ""wait. Are you implying that X is a socially awkward loser? I don't think so.""

And he'll be forced to take back his point or change his stance.

If you're the only one who mentioned reddit and you sense that he's aiming at you (but you're not sure) then you could ask him questions that narrow down his comment to exactly what he means - ""have you met any redditor?"" / ""Did you have a bad experience with a redditor in real life""?

But most likely he'll just be making a general statement and it might not be worth getting involved. But if you're the one who's extensively been talking about reddit alone then you can clarify a little more. ""What makes him say that?"" / ""So you think people on reddit are losers by you think people on twitter aren't?"" And leave it at that."
soc_471235,socialskills,reddit_comment,211,"I can relate. Sarcasm is sometimes called the lowest form of wit. A healthy dose of it here and there is generally well received but if your humor revolves around it, I’d start to hone other forms . I was really good at sarcasm, too, but I realized more and more that there was a certain contemptuous about it and aura of negativity that felt like it had become a bad habit. Again, I still appreciate and use affectionate sarcasm but I think it’s important to strike a balance. Also, you mention that a lot of your social interactions rely on humor. Humor is great, don’t get me wrong. But, if overdone,  it can come off as a defense mechanism that can prevent true connection and intimacy.  I’d try staying quiet at the times you think about cracking one of your typical jokes and see what other types of responses emerge. I find it more satisfying when I’m open to other more earnest or compassionate responses or humor that revolves around something slightly absurd yet innocuous. Also, you might find it a relief not to always have to be funny which might open up more complex and varied ways of interacting? Anyways just my two cents based on my own experiences. "

I'll be honest, I, and several others, have laid out the tools for you to take control of your situation and move past your self-defeating beliefs. It's up to you to take them and do something with them now. Wishing you luck.

soc_86318,socialskills,reddit_comment,177,"&gt; If not, don't.

If I can add a counterpoint, you should not feel social pressured to do something you dont want to do just because everyone else in the group does.

The peer pressure argument of ""well all the other guys in the group do it so you should too"" argument can be very compelling. But nobody should ever be shamed or guilt tripped into doing something they are not comfortable with.

I have a grand total of 6 people on my ""hug friends"" list. And there are some social circles where a hello-hug or goodbye-hug is the default standard. I have had to explain on many occasions that I simply do not know the person well enough that I feel comfortable with a hug. (They do get a high five if they want though!)

Your personal boundaries on who you do or do not feel comfortable hugging is entirely your choice. If the two other guys in the group think that is ""rather weird"" then it is them who has the problem and not you."
soc_1576464,socialskills,reddit_comment,893,"Btw when I say ""you"", I do not mean you, as the person reading this *could* be quiet, but my message goes out easier this way lol.

Anyway,

My 14 y/o sister calls me boring quite often because I'm quiet, reserved, and don't want to leave the house 😛 Well, at least I'm willing to be myself and not conform to other people's standards, take that sister!

So yes, I agree on the comment section that quiet people are boring, and not that many people are brave/confident or interested enough to get them talking, but in almost every case, you have to talk to someone to get to know them better, and that goes especially to quiet people.

**The cause of being quiet are a variety of reasons though. The quiet individual could just be shy, nervous, awkward, self-conscious, etc. But while people could assume those reasons, they might as well think these very reasonable situations as well, such as the loss of a loved one, mental illness/disorder, health reasons, or maybe they just think you're unapproachable because they are humans who can see you too :o 

**So, I think some ways to fix that is try to feel... open? Like idk, if you're sitting down in an active conversation, try not to look at your phone or look distracted, but try to make yourself attentive to the conversation. But what if the conversation isn't one you're well-versed in or one you do not care about? I don't think it could hurt to ask questions about it if you want to go about it that way, but I think you're better off leaving the conversation and wait for another time. OR if you're lucky enough, maybe look for other people that are not interested in the conversation not so much and talk with them.

**Okay this is the 2nd long edit I've made because I keep seeing comments making me facepalm and say, ""Well why didn't I think of that?"".

**So, one-on-one conversations.

**In this situation, one quiet person and one chatty person. The chatty person is no doubt going to be uncomfortable chilling with a quiet person, and so as I said before, opening yourself to that chatty person may help relieve them of that tension surrounding you two. Even if opening yourself is scary, at least you know you're with a chatty person that's 100% going to reply back freely to you lmao. (What if you're somehow the chatty person tho? That can apply to the following -&gt;) However, what if you're BOTH quiet? Well, one of you guys are going to need to be the leader here :P I don't think either will leave the other person ignored, so they will respond if something is asked, probably not a lot of words spoken though. Open-ended are the best questions to ask a quiet person, it forces them to speak a longer answer, and the longer you both chat, the more you both will get comfortable with each other speaking your thoughts out with less hesitation/limitation. And yes I'm going to stop editing before this gets even longer no matter what I see and facepalm myself. Too. Many. Goddamn. Situations.

But in short, yes quiet people are seen as boring (maybe arrogant but not so much), but I'm sure they're great people once you got them interested in talking to YOU. I think getting a quiet person's attention is great because they are usually (hint: not always pls dont give me 'what ifs', ur smart enough) observing everyone around them, overhearing conversations, etc. Even better if you and the quiet person likes the same stuff.

If you're having trouble, I think just starting up an introduction like, ""Hey my name is [ur name]"" and they'll probably follow up with their own, continue on from there with some topics like gaming, reading, sports, etc. It will probably be weird at first but the more you show you want to talk to them, the more they are willing to let you talk to them, and even come to you themselves.

That's just a basic scenario that could happen, but ultimately it's up to you on how to decide on how to break the ice.

As a lady myself, though I cannot speak on the behalf of all, I don't find quiet guys scary or creepy at all, unless they have a van spraypinted with ""Free candy"" on it (o.o) JK nothing against people having a van with free candy spraypainted on it, right? monkaLaugh. About the awkward part though, it really depends on how you portray yourself, like are you clumsy? Standing slouched over with your arms sticking out? But if being quiet itself seems awkward, it COULD be in a group project or something, but generally I myself do not think so :3

To continue, if you look decent and well-kept, I think ladies will be fine. I personally find myself gravitating towards quiet guys more because they are not so loud about themselves. It's hard to deliver something like a one-size fit all answer, but I hope this somewhat helped the OP and other people scrolling down the comment section :)

But TRULY, overall...

It's okay if you simply just don't want to talk :D let people think what they want to think.

soc_1802207,socialskills,reddit_comment,213,"The function of confidence is reducing how much emotion you feel when taking actions with unknown outcomes. 

When someone is confident, they can form opinions and make decisions without being biased by loss aversion.

The more someone erroneously inflates the odds and impact of a low roll scenario, the less confident they look. 

Note that this is based on perception, though, so a dumbass might think you're weak-spined for wearing a seatbelt, even though it's absolutely the right call. 

I'm not saying it's necessarily easy, but if you can find ways to *accurately* assess the actual downsides of bad outcomes, that would be a huge step towards confidence. A lot of the time, there are fake downsides to actions that you can eliminate with enough practice - for example, a girl rejecting you is sad, but there are ways to control exactly how much it ruins your week to feel sad for a day. People who can feel negative emotions without it impacting their livelihoods tend to have better Expected Values because the downside for feeling sad is way less for them.

In terms of actually changing how impactful negative emotions are on you... Everyone is different, unfortunately. But I think looking into that kind of thing would be a great next step."
soc_879985,socialskills,reddit_comment,493,"hey man, I just wanted to share with you my recent history and hopefully you'll feel a little better

I arrived in Germany for a new job 2 weeks before the pandemic started to unfold, then I started to work from home, I'm from Brazil and I'm completely alone in here, I don't have friends, I don't know anyone except from the people at work that I don't have contact except for professional contact... And I don't speak German.

I have an autoimune disease and obviously I need medical care, the first doctor that I went literally said ""go seek someone else"", he wouldn't get me because he was there ""only for emergencies"" (no one was at the praxis when I arrived, it was empty), I went home crying in the subway without being able to clean my nose because I was wearing a mask, I felt alone and helpless while strangers looked at me with confused faces. After some other doctors appointments and exams I needed a surgery, it was last week and I'm recovering already, but I can't walk and it's being hard... living alone, you know? Sleeping is the worst part because of pain, I had a fever a couple of days ago but it went away.

But you know what? I've lived in Brazil my whole life, there we don't have clear transition of weather seasons... It's always so fuckying hot and sunny, with a sun that burns your skin and gets you cancer lol

Here in Germany we are leaving winter and we're currently at Spring. When I arrived I've saw snow for the first time in my whole life, I was working and them said on Slack ""it's snow!"" and everyone kept saying ""go out and play!"" and now I can see what it is to have a spring, and it's beautiful. There's so much in life that we take for granted, and it's actually so beautiful, magical, almost miraculous. I can see the birds and hear them sing, feel the wind, the pollen (and some deadly coronavirus) going with the wind... Some honeybees get stuck at my apartment when I leave my window opened, then I get a glass, make them enter it and help them find the light.

So don't worry, be happy and be grateful for the good things you have in life, everyone is different and you know what is best for you, this is just a phase, like last year... When I was ran over and my bike was smashed by 2 cars, if I didn't jump out of it I could be dead by now.

We don't know each other and life is hard. But it could be beautiful too, so focus your attention on good things, things will be better, I can assure you, we have bad phases and then happy moments with people that cares if you live or die.

Tell her you think she looks pretty. (People LOVE compliments) 

See if she has any interest in you at all. If she declines she may have a b/f or whatever but you can start looking elsewhere. 

Spend time with her by shopping together in a ""non-dating"" activity. This is where you get to know each other in a safe public setting. You will learn if she is a careful shopper or not, can shop to a budget, has good taste in clothes, etc. 

99% of the time she will shop for clothes with you. There's no pressure, no expectations, and growing up she dressed little dolls. Here you are, a life size doll, asking to be dressed. 

It doesn't matter if she brings along a friend, parent, etc.  Just remember, set a dollar amount you don't want to go over, (be realistic, if you don't know what's reasonable, ask your parents or an older friend) and you must buy her something as well. That can also have a max dollar amount.

Ask them things. Show some interest, show them it's worth talking to you. If you just keep talking you're painting yourself as a self-important prick that's in love with his own voice - why would an introverted person want to open up to you then? And give them a moment or two of silence where they can collect their thoughts and answer. Or just shut up and hang out quietly for a minute, that wont kill anyone.

Find a common ground, some interests that you share and slow . your . pace . the . fuck . down. If an introvert feels like they need to keep up a conversation in a certain way that they aren't good at - at your pace, about topics they don't care about just for the sake of filling dead air, and where every moment of silence is a social failure - then of course they may prefer to not participate at all and just not say anything."

just ignore that kind of post instead of trying to censor people. because one day someone may label something you wrote in good faith as ""toxic"" as well.

the worst thing about reddit are people trying to shoot down certain types of posts because of their PERSONAL preference - applying it to everyone. i see this all the time - the ""STOP POSTING X"" types of posts.


&gt; These people need support and understanding in a sub where people discuss and seek advice. Not ridicule, shame or mockery. 

i think people need to see the whole spectrum of opinions instead of getting a pat on the back for anything they post. sometimes the so-called 'tough love' may get you to realize that you have problems and can't run away from them.

if - in context of that answer - someone wrote : ""i think you have issues forming meaningful relationships if you did not have a friend until 40"". would you instantly shoot it down as 'toxic'? or would you stop and think ""you know, they might have a point there"". ?"
soc_402988,socialskills,reddit_comment,191,"I used to do this every time I drank and still occasionally do, but I started to realize that unless people bring it up to you, they probably don't remember. If you're drinking with other people they're probably just about as drunk as you are, and also doing dumb, drunk person shit. Drinking is the ultimate example of the saying ""You’ll worry less about what people think of you when you realize how seldom they do"".  How often do you think back on something that your friend did that was stupid while they were drunk? Probably not nearly as often as the things you remember about yourself. And chances are you remember it as a funny memory filled with drunk antics.

As others have said, learn to pace yourself as well, and know yourself when you're drunk. I've become very good at knowing how much alcohol I can have without going too far, while still having a great time, whereas my friends who never had the anxiety issue still get blackout drunk on accident, because they never had to pay pacing any mind. It's almost become a blessing in disguise, haha."
soc_90326,socialskills,reddit_comment,407,"This is a minor addition and in no way rules out the other comments here.

First, a direct response to your question: I often find myself saying something along the lines of ""Of course!"" or ""Yeah! Definitely."" Especially at work. It's nice because it can sound 'removed' (in the good, professional sense) while still remaining rather chic in many contexts. However, there's plenty of concrete substitute phrases here already, and I actually wanted to add something different.

I know this sounds strange, but hear me out. When I muster a reply (be it ""Of course!""; or ""You're welcome!""; etc.), I make an honest effort to imagine - ""Hey, you know what? This is a pretty nice guy or gal!""; or: ""this person is human and has needs, and I can understand those needs.""; or, at the very least: ""I didn't do much! It was little effort on my part, really. Given the chance, I would genuinely not mind helping him or her again."" I muster this bond between myself and the other person, and from that follows quite naturally the inviting body language, the goofy grin, and so on...

Essentially, what I am proposing is this. Don't look for an instruction manual for every possible ""Thank you!"" response -- not just because you sure as hell aren't going to get one; but because *hey, goddamnit,* this is a real, bonafide *opportunity* to develop a bond with the person who is thanking you. How exciting! You should actively engage with the person's thanks -- rather than mechanically respond with whatever you think might elicit the best response, or best advance your social agenda, etc. (which I think is in the very nature of your question, not to mention [as I always silently complain to myself] the culture of this sub). The technical, step-by-step ""instruction manual"" method is as good as gold if you're starting out, BUT you eventually need to lose the training wheels and just be genuine. Of course, this takes practice in itself. But I think that sincerity is the true paradigm of social skills -- not merely saying the right thing all the time. So I conclude: don't worry about the individual words. Instead, give them a genuine meaning!

I apologize if I've blown this way out of proportion. (I think about these little things all of the time, too.) Hopefully I've helped at least a little bit. Have a nice rest of your day."
soc_1745847,socialskills,reddit_comment,200,"I believe it should be your decision if your gut tells you to go, but in my opinion if the thought terrifies you, you should say no thanks to that concert. It sounds like you need more baby steps putting yourself in small social situations and working your way up. 
That concert is no baby step, its a lot of people and high energy. You know if anyone initiates a conversation with you it will likely be awkward small talk with someone you'll never see again or get a phone number only to never hang out with them again. 
Or, no one's talking to you and everyone's watching the concert, which, I mean that could be fun by yourself if you like the group(s) performing?

If you want to put yourself out there more, I suggest organizing chill outings with 2-3 aquaintences you like at a time (preferably at least one of them being an extravert), until you get to know each other and become friends with at least one of them. with smaller groups, you can have more attention on you when you want it, and you can back off and be quiet when you don't want the attention."
soc_293877,socialskills,reddit_comment,1008,"First off, thank you for sharing your feelings and experiences with us my friend. I thought long and hard about how to respond to you with some advice so bare with me; what I came up with might seem a bit uncanny.

&amp;nbsp;

Now before I start, I want to say that your story is my story - *verbatim*. The only difference is the time frame; your living my life as it took place about three years ago. I've since improved a lot both in my social and professional life, although I've still got a lot of growing to do in certain aspects.  Having said that, I want to try something with you. The next few paragraphs are essentially a letter to my past-self. Here's the kicker though: I want *you* to read the letter as if each paragraph is a piece to an open letter that you, /u/SmoresByTheShore, wrote and sent to yourself from the future. In other words, future you is talking to present you **right now** and wants to share his life with you via an open letter. Got it? Okay.

&amp;nbsp;

Ahem... hello old friend! First things first: You made it! If you take one piece of information from me, let it be this: You chose a happy life, with an exciting group of friends, and **you've made it**. Right now your struggling with life questions *every single soon-to-be college graduate* is trying to answer. What do I want out of life? Is the one thing I've been working towards even what I want to do? Should I take this job close to home or pack up and set out across the country? What does the ""right"" choice look like? Here's the cold hard truth; there is no right choice, just choices - decision, options, opportunities, whatever you wanna call it. Never right or wrong, that doesn't exist. 

Remember that one piece of information I shared in the first sentence? ""**You chose** a happy life, with friends"". It's true! You *chose*. You *chose* that drifting further and further into the background wasn't how you wanted to live your life. You *chose* to turn your life's gothic narrative on it's head! You *chose* to find more in common with people than just the course you both happened to sign up for that semester.

Now I know you're probably laughing out loud in your room right now, having to stop for a breath, at the thought of just how impossible this fairytale of a life seems to be. ""There's no way my life turns out this stable and grounded."" ""There's *definitely* no way I'll be friends with anyone from college three years down the road... scratch that, there's no way we'll keep in touch 3 hours after graduation, let alone 3 years!""

&amp;nbsp;

I'm gonna tell you *exactly* how you made that possible:

&amp;nbsp;

* **You stopped using your phone for social media** - Instagram, Facebook, Twitter: all of these things are powerful social tools that can enhance your friendship circle beyond imagination! The only issue is you aren't capable of using them while having insecure, anxiety driven, self-centered undertones. You just aren't compatible with these social tools yet, but you will be soon.
* **You started using your phone to make calls** - Lots of calls! ""Hey, there's a minor league baseball stadium near Zach's place. I should call him and ask if he wants to catch a game some time."" "" There's a new bar in town just a few blocks from the med school. I should see if Lauren is in need of a study break."" ""I can't believe Katy got a job in New York City! I need to get back in touch with her and plan a visit this summer."" (That last one actually happened! June 10th 2017, mark your calendar)
* **You showed gratitude** - It's important to show gratitude because some things in life we are just simply lucky to have. Period. Gratitude can also make you feel like you have more than you may perceive. You should keep doing it everyday, with everyone in your life, in any little way you can. You chose to use your first paycheck from your job at the hospital on a weekend trip to the mountains with your family. You figured ""Hey, they put me through college. It's the least I could do."" How about the professors that agreed to be your personal reference on all those job applications? You sent them gift cards to the spa. Always be mindful of what you have and who you have around you and show some gratitude.
* **You chose to listen** - The best part of most conversations is hearing what others have to say. Look people in the eye and listen carefully. When it's your turn, use an interesting bit of info you heard as a spring board to move the conversation forward.
* **You chose to touch** - Let me explain. You used touch as a way to communicate. Physical touch is powerful when used in conversation - a pat on the back, a touch on the forearm, a slap on the shoulder, a hand on the knee. It all communicates emotions. Use it when appropriate and it can be really effective in a conversation.
* **You nurtured the right friendships** - Connections between people can feel limited and fleeting, especially in college. The act of making friends is so interesting after graduation, because you have to decide who you'd like to hold on to a connection with from your college days and whether or not it's better to just venture into life's great beyond to find better, newer friendships. It's important, though, to nurture and tend to relationships that got off to a good start and show potential to grow. Keep in touch, call them, plan visits, send gifts.

&amp;nbsp;

Well bud, that's all I've got for now. Remember what I said: You made it!. Just **make choices**, with good intentions, and you'll be writing to thank yourself in no time."
soc_721397,socialskills,reddit_comment,148,"I text my close friends every day. They text me too, we all enjoy it. However, I have other friends that I text once a week, or only talk to in person. It depends on the person, and the important thing is that everyone is comfortable. If you feel comfortable not texting, then you shouldn’t do it just because other people do.

About the girl: First off, a heart is not a price to be won. Second, no one can tell you how to act with her, as the only information we have is that she is a girl. She’s a person with likes and dislikes, just as everybody else, and it’s impossible to know if she would like texting you without knowing her.
So, again, do as you like. If you feel like texting her, do it. If you feel fine just talking at school, do that."
soc_126395,socialskills,reddit_comment,150,"You know what you need to do, buddy, is go out and get absolutely shitfaced wasted and make the biggest, most public, disgustingest ass of yourself you possibly can.

Then, when you wake up the next day with a hangover from hell and it feels like Satan is shitting in your head all day you'll come to feel (not just understand) that, hey, it's really not that big a deal to be social. So long as you're not hurting anyone else the worst that'll happen is you come away with a story to tell in the future. 

People like people with funny stories and if they're stories that don't paint you in the best light, so be it. As long as you get a laugh out of someone you're making them feel good, and it helps you take yourself less seriously which will ease social interactions. Just my two cents. "
soc_1209007,socialskills,reddit_comment,217,"That’s social anxiety. You might be fine taking to adults, teachers, doctors, or random people because there really isn’t any social pressure. They aren’t your peers and you really aren’t tying to be their friend and develop interpersonal relationships. There is nothing at stake and you don’t have to feel vulnerable. It’s just safe and comfortable for you. 


When you talk to people your age or girls you have skin in the game. You naturally want their approval, their friendship, their acceptance, and sometimes a deeper relationship. This scenario increases anxiety because you don’t want to be judged, rejected, or hurt. It’s risky for you and your ego. You have to open up and be vulnerable knowing that they might not like you. 


In addition to that, it’s more formal talking to adults and that can be easier to understand. Social situations have a different flow. They aren’t formal and can be chaotic, silly, and goofy, with a lot of joking and teasing. It’s more difficult and require more social awareness and skills. When talking to girls you have even more complexity with flirting and sexual advances. 


It’s not the same for everyone. Some people are the total opposite and feel more pressure talking to parents and adults and are fine around their peers. Everyone is different."
soc_958076,socialskills,reddit_comment,279,"Did you talk to her about it? Maybe she didn't intend to hurt you with it. Often people don't notice how much effort someone else is putting in their relationship with them, and you can't always blame them for it. 
It's a great thing you cared for her this much, but I think she is not obligated to do the same for you. If you want to be nice to a person, that's awesome, but don't do it because you expect the person to behave in a certain way because of it. If you have high expectations for people, it's no wonder they will disappoint you at some point. That doesn't make them a bad person. 
If you tell her about your feelings, and she still doesn't want to give you what you want her to give, you can think about investing less in the friendship. It's your decision and yours alone how much you want to invest, and the same goes for her. 
I think it is not the right approach to think about a way to get back on her. She might have no idea that you are thinking she's in the wrong. Talk to her, and try to understand her position. And if she doesn't want to meet your expectations and you don't want to adapt them, leave. But don't think about revenge, it's not gonna make you happy, and it most certainly isn't right. 
I hope this helped you, and I wish you all the best. 

Oh, and don't lose hope in people, really, most people are nice - they just don't always do what you want them to. Sucks, but such is life. 😟😌"
soc_1231631,socialskills,reddit_comment,138,"This sounds like a dumb thing to say, but neither your mom nor you are qualified to say whether you are ugly or good looking.  Both of you are too close to be able to really tell, and it's a viewer dependent thing anyway.  My older step-daughter grew up convinced she was unattractive (probably due to her jerk of a biological dad), and it was heart breaking at times.  The fact was that she was strikingly pretty and attractively shaped, and when I would be walking somewhere with her, in a mall or on a sidewalk, groups of boys/men would literally turn to watch her and she flat out couldn't see it and got mad when I tried to tell her.  Isolate yourself from what you think you 'know', it always has a significant chance of being wrong."
soc_823179,socialskills,reddit_comment,131,"I’ve had this problem my whole life. I hate awkward silences between conversations. I try my hardest to think about stuff to talk about. I kinda imagine the person who’s talking to me is having the same issue. When I think like this, I’m able to relax and have more time to think. I have a bad memory from an injury as a child. So sometimes I get embarrassed when I can’t think of 4x4 because I panic and can’t think of the answer. Being able to have full conversations comes with experience and practice. You will have a lot of awkward conversations, but it’s up to you to learn from that and not make the same mistakes. I consider my self an introvert but most people say I’m very extroverted."

- you both have a great time together every time
- it keeps happening every week
- she really opens up to you in that time
- you seem more and more compatible as time goes on
- she is really happy in your presence, is interested in your life and interests, etc.

bonus:

- she spends her birthdays with you, one on one.

i mean, what is a guy to think here? i was honestly surprised that someone that interested in spending alone time (who i found very attractive as well) with me would want to be just friends.

People like this are usually really frustrated and hyper aware of themselves. Constantly checking and anticipating criticism. They override it with insults. Typical mean girl stuff. 
There is nothing you could have done or say that would change their narrative. They would think that you are hurt because you know they are right and that’s it. Because the problem is never them. It’s always you. 
So please, enjoy your happy married life and try to let this ugly memory go. Feel petty for them for having an ugly heart. When we are (hopefully) old, we will all look the same and only character will tell people who we are ♥️"
soc_877454,socialskills,reddit_comment,394,"Change your mindset. If you understand The odds are in your favor if executed properly. 50/50 chance to gain the interest of any female for any male should be enough to roll them dice on any situation. 

This is the part that most (myself included at ) don't understand one time. You must understand the proper way to execute a plan to gain someone's interest. 

Females do not want to be told they are liked by a male. They don't sit there hoping if any guy is gonna come over and pass them a note that says ""like me? Check yes or no.""  

You yourself are responsible for creating that interest for any female. She wants to see all the things that hit the list of check marks every female has before ever entertaining the idea. Learning what these checkmarks are up to you to learn and figure out and execute properly with each different situation. 

If you have to ask a female if she likes you, then you just have made yourself the last person she would ever consider. Here's why, the men who don't have to ask that question already know he has her attention. He is confident in himself because of the proper checkmarks he creates and promotes and then sits and waits and takes has his pick. Now it's the females who are making themselves appealing and showing interest in hopes of being that one girl he picks above all the rest that want him. And that's what females fight for everyday. To be the one picked above all the rest. Females just want to feel like they are the only girl in the world. 

Key point to drive it home. 
A female a will automatically put you a catagory of sexual interest or gay best guy friend (who isn't gay) within the first 60seconds of meeting you. After this 60 second window your given your fate has been sealed forever and like a black hole you can't ever escape. (There's been some stories myths legends about some who escaped the black hole) my point is   promote and create interest for yourself before meeting anyone and sealing your fate determind with in 60seconds.  Highlight your best features and own it. You decide for yourself if any female finds  Interest in you. You don't ask and hope for interest CREATE IT."
soc_218142,socialskills,reddit_comment,158,"Hmm. It's tough to say because you're the only one who really understands what you're going through. It kind of sounds like there isn't much passion in your life. Outside of work, what is it you do to better yourself? Is it something you can be proud of? I still have issues with confidence, but I feel much better when I'm accomplishing things in music, which is my passion. I feel like I can speak to people about my day easier, I'm much more curious in other people, and most importantly I feel like an equal. Very often, I feel like a lesser individual to the people I speak to, and I have the same issues with stuttering and freezing up that you mentioned. 

As corny as this sounds, follow your heart my friend. Make sure every decision you make brings you one step closer to that happiness you're looking for (once you've found it) and don't stop."
soc_1263661,socialskills,reddit_comment,152,"I have some experience with this. My family is also wealthy and I'm weary about how I come across to others. But I have a cousin who helped me understand this. She's more middle-class and very hard working, I have a lot of respect for her.

She has a pretty rich friend and says her friend can be snobby about stuff (like the stuff you mentioned, but a bit more so) but she's OK with it because her friend embraces it. If her friend were unaware, she would be much more annoyed.

So what I've learned to do, and I recommend to you, is to strike a balance between toning down the ""stuck up"" attitude and being comfortable with it. Like, you can't help being annoyed at a lack of dinner options (and you can voice that opinion), but you also don't need complain/throw a fit/etc about it. Hope that makes sense."

If you don't like something about yourself, you can work on changing it, but do it for yourself, nobody else.

soc_1406365,socialskills,reddit_comment,152,"Just proceed to hang out as you would with your ""regular"" friends. If at any point she makes obvious advances / tries to escalate the convo, then you can just tell her you're taken or not looking for a relationship atm. Some women might do it but chances are she's hoping you will escalate things, assuming she's interested. The more time you spend hanging out and just being friends *and you give no escalation or flirting*, it should be obvious to her you're not into her in that way.

I personally don't think it's classy to just bluntly tell her you're not attracted to her but only want her as a smart study buddy. If and only if she seriously tries escalating, and pushes past the graceful deflections IE: ""I'm taken / not looking right now"" - then it's totally warranted imo / up to you to give her the straight dope."
soc_1453766,socialskills,reddit_comment,1642,"&gt; How do people get respect

The surprising thing is: you don't ""get"" respect from other people. 

And other people don't ""receive"" it from you. You can _choose to act respectfully_; but it's your personal choice, not theirs.

Personally I usually choose it, because I think and feel that by taking this course the world would be in a bit better place.

Also you can feel a _want to act respectfully_, which is elicited by feeling of admiration for someone or something evoked by their abilities, qualities, achievements. 

You can also want and choose to act respectfully towards yourself; which is basically self-respect.

&gt; while I always had to prove my self

I really know how it feels.

But in the end, there is nothing that needs to be proved to them, and you can stop trying to hard :)

Because self-respect also includes giving yourself freedom from that self-induced pressure.

&gt; How do people get liked?

There may be many ways. And many of those are fleeting and superficial.

I think a good way would be: working on emotional maturity, vulnerability, integrity, self-soothing, self-acceptance, self-love and self-respect.

I dated one woman, and still remember feeling her high level of modest self-acceptance and calm self-respect. That was very attractive. I admired that, and was unbeknownstly trying to learn from her. 

&gt; How do people get respect/or are at least liked and not bullied, I ask because from my pov people just get it for free while I always had to prove my self and fight for it and never even got civil behavior from many people in my class as a child and a teen?

It may appear that they ""get it for free"". But it's important to see the difference between respect that comes from admiration, and: fake respect, fake social proof, and situations where teens create small groups and use those to trade the appearance of ""social-acceptance"". 

&gt; My psychologist that I went to like 3 times suspects asperger but I am honestly afraid of that diagnosis since where I live people still call these people the R word (mentally slow) 

I am reading your post, and you don't appear mentally slow.

Also, are you really engaged in repetitive patterns?

Maybe your behaviour could be seen to her as avoidant or anti-social. But it could easily be caused by a reaction to having your boundaries crossed by uncultured peers.

Also there are people that can be mistaken to have autist/asperger simptoms, but it's actually their sensitivity to sensory and especially emotio-audial information, which quickly leads to overstimulation, sensory overload and results in desire to distance and close off.

https://en.yburlan.ru/node/1717

Does anything ring a bell here? ^

&gt; Damned If I react damned if I don't react

You put it really well. 

That's pretty much how I felt at age 14-16. And I remember trying a plethora of different strategies. Some effective, some not. Here are some of them:

- totally ignoring: was ineffective; and not healthy (because taking bad behaviour from others is not healthy)

- subtle and disguised counter-insults: partially effective because they confuse the bullies; but it's not healthy, because you don't want to carry that venom in you

- growing emotional armor and camouflaging/misplacing your inner core: this was effective, because others could not hit my emotional weak spots. But this turned out to be emotionally unhealthy in the long run; because it damaged my genuine vibe and ability to form emotional connection.

- emotionally distancing, becoming cold, overusing intellectualization and abstraction: this was effective, but unhealthy. Over time it numbs you emotionally; makes cold; and rises the emotional safety bar for others too much.

- build emotional walls: this was effective, but unhealthy in the long run, because in order to approach me, people had to either pass the walls (and they couldn't) or demonstrate how emotionally safe and accepting they for enough time for the walls to melt; and no one had the desire to wait enough, or perhaps the energy to do it.

-----

In the end the secret was:

- to act, instead of react

- to allow yourself to feel. Even if it hurt. Yes I feel hurt, and allow myself to feel it through me, along with anger, confusion, sadness and all emotions. Let if feel through, flow through, and let it go through.

- to self-soothe, self-love and self-respect

- to set healthy psychological boundaries. And act when they are crossed. And important note: act within the limits of my boundaries. Someone thrown a dirty rag at you? Tell that you don't like rag being thrown at you, and that you would prefer to be understood from the first time without having to shove it back. If they understand: great! If not: get that rag, come close and throw it in their face, tell ""I have warned you. And this is what you get. If this will repeat again, I will talk about this with principle / authority figure, and we'll see what we can do about it."" or ""and we'll get your parents involved"".
No anger, no resentment, just a bit of disappointment from their behaviour, and calm but firm warning what _will_ happen.
And if they will ignore your warning again, act, and make it happen. 
If principle or director or whoever is responsible won't do his job; use next lever. There are special guardianship departments for that (at least in my country; dunno how they are called in yours). 
And lastly you can change school/college. You may feel anxious about it, but as the last resort it is the right thing to do. You demonstrate self-respect to yourself, by physically distancing from abusive situation where you have no control over; and move to a healthier and more productive environment.

&gt; I am currently asexual due to boys being pure psychopaths

Northern-star1458, your resentment is greatly understood. But it would greatly help to substitute ""boys"" with ""some boys"" or at least ""all boys that I have known so far"", in order to avoid some specific problems later on. There is a chance that you will meet a great guy few years later, but interacting with him will trigger these old, buried pain and resentment and it will be really hard to become close, intimate and vulnerable. Don't do it to yourself.

&gt; It is not in my programming to insurl random people just cause I don't like what they wear

And this is great!

&gt; I don't understand what is it to not care about other people and also insult them at the same time. I just don't. How do you not care and also attack them.

I have spent a looooot of time trying to understand why. 
And couldn't get it.

In the end, I have figured a list of whys:

- some teens are abused by their caregivers. They feel weak at home, and perceive their caregivers as strong. When they repeat their caregivers' behaviour at school, they kinda feel strong too. 

- some teens are treated poorly at home. But they depend on their caregivers, and their mind makes a trick by believing that this is actually they way it is meant to be. They repeat that behaviour at school, and even feel righteous about it.

- some people don't feel empathy; or not as strong as others do.

- some don't have the concept of healthy boundaries. And they constantly overstep the boundaries of others around them

- some keep testing the boundaries of others, to see how further they can get  

- some are sadistic and authoritative/commanding, either because they are emulating their parents behaviour, or because it's one the multiple ways the conscious mind runs away from basic anxiety

- some like you, and it's their way to get your active attention

- some feel less worthy compared to peers, and try to find anything where they are better than others. Quite often clothes are used for that, or proclaiming diametrically different interests, or forming small social groups (think of mean girls groups)

- some try to rebel against system that uses metric that estimates that in unfavorable way. Schools literally use grades. And this can easily cause those who underperform to constantly carry feelings of anger.

- some are caught in the storm of hormones, emotions, confusion, and try to emulate the behaviours of ""popular ones, who seem to have it figured out""

- people are different. And school/college is one the places were the most different and immature people are brought in one room. Lack of understanding is almost bound to happen. For example it gets much better in University, where students are much more likely to have similar interests

- different people may have different psychological needs, and perceive and react differently to the same situation

- children and teens tend to repeat to a certain degree the tribal life; and threaten others by different forms of rejection and alienation (because for majority it was dreadful to get expulsed from the tribe in the stone age)

- many teens, subconsciously try to find their place in hierarchy; and often use conflict and provocations

- some teens lack healthy ways of processing emotions. Some suffer from emotional neglect. Many have parents who suffered from that neglect, and thus couldn't teach them

- some insecurities do not manifest in anxiety, shyness or stuff like that. Instead it can take the appearance of narcissism or compensation.


This list above is not necessary complete; but it is already enough to describe what emotional turmoil can happen within a class/school/college atmosphere. 

TL.DR. Don't take personally what happens during that time. Because it is not personal.

Otherwise you might have to spend years, and am speaking from experience here... to unravel and detangle that emotional knot cause by buried pain and resentment.

Good luck :)"
soc_1533813,socialskills,reddit_comment,353,"Lately, I’ve been thinking about that too. I think it’s part of a social, cultural and economic mindset that inserted in our minds the idea of a single and unique love forever. Just like the movies. “She is the one”. “He is the one”. But once you think about It, sounds weird. I mean, really? One single love forever? We are humans, we are animals and obviously we are going to be attracted to someone else. 

I’ve been reading about it and all these ideas are related to the concept of romantic love; where, for example, marriage is the final step. Marriage and have kids. If that doesn’t happen, then the relationship didn’t work. So, every relationship is doomed until you find the girl you decide to marry? It is really frustrating to think about that. 


I realized there are different types of relationships, like open relationships with different names haha and I am on that stage right now, but it’s been really difficult for me to start something like that, bc the mindset we all have is like a force of gravity that doesn’t allows us to do something else. 

I also realized that if I decide to start a relationship, I will enjoy every second and moment with the person I decide to spend time with. If at some point I start to suffer the relationship, I will end it, because my goal is enjoy the process. So I can say that to you, yes, every relationship is doomed to end (also bc we die) but it’s up to you to decide what would you like to live in the present day. Who is the person you would like to spend the present day with? If you are not enjoying the present day, then finish it. And yes, there are people that will have 1 gf or bf for their whole lives, and it’s ok. It’s ok if they are enjoying it. But if you look closer, the number of infidelities is so high that I wonder if the mindset we have chosen is congruent with our feelings. I don’t know..."

soc_1133682,socialskills,reddit_comment,394,"Sure. Just FYI, I saw some typos in my original post, so I fixed them to make more sense. Damn iPhone typing. Anyway.

You are facing a very typical dilemma men have, which is ""I want sex =&gt; I need a vagina to have sex with =&gt; Woman has vagina =&gt; I have to do whatever woman tells me to do so I can have access to vagina"". Sorry to be crude, but basically most guys all think along these lines. 

The issue with this line of thinking is that you are making sex with the woman the prize. Instead, the prize should be your enjoyment. What that constitutes is up to you. Perhaps it's a non committed, casual sexual relationship. Perhaps it's just two people getting together and having some fun and banging. If a serious relationship is not what you enjoy, then that's that. 

The way you stay in control is to decide exactly what it is that you want and focus on that only, not on what the woman wants. That is, don't try to please her because you think you will have a chance to sleep with her. Say what you want upfront and if she's cool with it great, if she's not, than end things then and there. 

Don't go on dates. At most arrange a quick drink with someone at your favorite bar, invite her to tag along and ad you get to know each other, tell her that you are not the commitment type, you don't communicate a lot, don't like to feel pressured, and that all you can promise her is that you will have some fun tonight. And leave it at that. Don't build any further expectations. Don't talk about her hopes and dreams and feelings. Keep it loose, kid around, be the fun guy and hook up. Tell her you are not available for anything but a purely physical relationship.

The reason most men don't want to be this honest with women is because they fear the woman will get angry and storm out and they will lose whatever little chance they had at getting pussy. So every guy is always playing by the woman's rules, taking her out on dates, being nice, showing what boyfriend material he is, always communicating with her. I can see why you don't want that in your life."
soc_1830614,socialskills,reddit_comment,339,"I related to this when you said it and di have a few points or things to think about since I struggle with this too, but this is just my perspective on it.

First, I wanna just say that this isn't a bad thing

I understand you want to have the type of close relationship you're seeing other people have, and I've been going through the exact same thing.

A first step is to kind of not be envious of those people who have that. We all get caught up in our thoughts but when we think about it - it's not really that we don't want them to have that, it's just that we want to have that.

Alot more goes into being friends than just compatibility, the situation really dictates who you'll spend your time with as well. 

If you're someone's roommate, or you're someone's coworker then you just will spend more time with them 

I know this is obvious but part of my answer is to just take a step back, appreciate the relationships you do have, and take them for what they are. Most importantly don't take this personally!!!!! Please dont


These situational circumstances can really shape how close you get to someone, and I think I read you joined sports and that's great for this. 

Eventually you're going to be seeing the same faces, and after someone spends enough time with you they'll get to see your true intentions, and your willingness to be a good friend - you'll get this in return as well most likely

I know that by putting yourself in the right situations you'll maximize your chances of this. Hang out with those friends that you think they have a closer relationship with each other than they have with you, meeting a friend of a friend is the best way to find a best friend 

I hope this made sense and please let me know if I can clarify any of these thoughts more since they may not make sense"
soc_661205,socialskills,reddit_comment,197,"Are you considering yourself a bad listener because you feel you could engage with people in general more? Or are you having these thoughts because Leslie won't stfu about this one thing that no-one else cares about?

If you want to engage people more and be more in touch with their emotions, be more in touch with your own emotions. Next time literally anything happens, just process the emotions. Someone in line was rude to you? Process what caused you to feel anger or embarrassment. Now that you are more familiar with the thought process of this emotion, next time someone talks about an embarrassing moment you have a frame of reference that could be useful in a conversation.

If Leslie is literally is blabbering on about her collection of figurines all day and obv you don't care beyond the usual polite gesture but she insists on talking about it to the point that she is forcing you to listen and calling you out for not even though its really fucking boring. Then Leslie honestly needs to be a better talker and you prob aren't necessarily a bad listener

soc_341511,socialskills,reddit_comment,518,"Out of curiosity do you wear a hijab or a niqab? This could make a big difference. Niqabs are not only more intimidating to an outsider, it also actively sends the message that you don't want to be spoken to. People unfamiliar with Islam would question if they are even allowed to talk to you if you aren't married to them. 

I don't want to be intrusive or anything but niqabs aren't mandatory in Islam. I don't know why they are part of some Islamic cultures, my guess is that they are remnants of a pre-Islamic pagan culture, but hijab is the only thing that is mandatory and some would even consider that questionable, especially outside of an Islamic country where the culture is different (some would argue it's enough just not to be revealing and the rest is up to local culture). 

Other than that I also had a disclaimer in my post where I said this may not work for everyone because everyone is different. Have you ever seen a therapist about it? That's the easier way to go. I'd definitely do it long ago if it was accessible to me.

To me it sounds like being stuck in a vicious cycle of overthinking things which was exactly my problem. The sooner you realize that all these things are completely irrational the better. I know people sometimes ignore me because I naturally speak by mumbling into myself (having a deep trombone voice doesn't help either) and sometimes I have to consciously make an effort to make myself understandable.

Even if they do ignore you it's their loss.

It kinda just helps (me) to view a conversation as a pass-time more than anything else. Like checking something on your phone or playing a game. If the other person doesn't partake it doesn't mean anything except that I'll have to find another pass-time. You don't have to be genuine or whatever. 

It also helps to know that people just go with the flow and you can make more than one first impression. So, if you were awkward in the pass with somebody and you meet them again and you're not awkward, they're not gonna think about how awkward you were but just go with the flow.

And another little tip is that people don't think about you as NEARLY as much as you think you do. How much do you think about other people really? Things like about how awkward they were? It's not like you're the only one on the planet.

I'm no professional but whatever it is, I always found comfort in the fact that social anxiety and depressions aren't practically even real. They're a thing in your head that you can overcome with the right help. They're not like being disfigured and people do change and get over it. I felt the exact same as you (except some minor details), and now I don't. If I can do it then so can you, even if my little tips don't help, some others might. The best thing definitely is to talk about it with a professional."
soc_299187,socialskills,reddit_comment,194,"The big thing about getting outside of your comfort zone is that it is uncomfortable.  It sounds like you are afraid of failure under pressure.  As in you don't want to look stupid or have people think less of you because you used the wrong word or stutterred or whatever.

Since you say you feel comfortable with discussion with people you know or people online, I would say start talking with people you're not comfortable with.  For example, one of my best friends is completely different from me.  He has totally different political and religious beliefs, but we have common respect for each other through some shared hobbies.  Surrounding yourself with things that makes you comfortable isn't going to change anything.  

I would recommend changing up your routine to break the loneliness.  If you sit inside all day, trying going for a walk to break up the day.  Go see a movie alone. Go sit in a coffee shop and watch something on a laptop. Whatever you think of.  I think just being in society and still doing the things you like to do will give you a better outlook on that lonely feeling."
soc_327617,socialskills,reddit_comment,164,"I'd say it's best to be the most outgoing and confident on the first couple days. This is for multiple reasons. First, studies show that people judge you the most during your first impressions. If you set yourself up as being a confident person on the first day, people will open up to you and you'll feel more comfortable around others. Start by greeting the people next to you. Ask for their name and give them yours. Ask them if they're looking forward to the class, if they have a house or if they're in a dorm. Maybe they're wearing a video games shirt and ask about the game or maybe you can share your opinion on the game if you know it. It can honestly be as simple as a compliment like, ""Hey I like your shirt.""The conversation starters are endless on the first couple days of school. Dress nicer than you usually do. Look as good as you can! You got it! "
soc_814052,socialskills,reddit_comment,370,"Ah. Those are tough. At the root of each of those, your intent is not to hurt, but to make what is ultimately the right decision. If you can’t be with your decision wholeheartedly, then you’re not really giving them what they want either. You’re only half in. When I’m faced with situations like those, I try to center myself on the overall truth of the situation and then present it with love and honesty. If I play any of the other decisions forward, they’re hollow and false and I can’t commit to them healthily long term, which means that it may look like a good choice to the other person at first, but really isn’t good for anyone in the long term. I present the truth to them (that I’m struggling with the response, how I see the other outcome). The boss situation you mentioned:  ‘I know you had plans for me and I respect and like you so much, this is really tough for me, but I don’t feel I could truly provide my best for you long term by staying here. I really need to (do other things, make more money...).’ 

RLExample: my husband was out of town, I was absolutely stretched thin with a new child and busy work schedule. My mother in law announced that she’d be coming to help. To me, that wasn’t helpful, it was intrusive and pushy and I simply didn’t have the emotional bandwidth to have a visitor. I stewed for a bit, got my emotions in check, figured out it really was me and this time had to be about me (I didn’t want to set a precedent of her just showing up, I didn’t want to blow up at her at some point if she did visit and knew I might have and I really had to honor what I felt was best at that time).  I politely apologized and hoped I hadn’t mislead her, but I really couldn’t take her up on her kind offer. It would simply have been too much for me at the time. It was a decision I knew I had presented kindly, honestly and that I could live with regardless of her reaction."
soc_344755,socialskills,reddit_comment,613,"You're welcome! I hope it is helpful. 

That being said, in my own experience, in a situation where you are expected to mingle the idea actually stays pretty much the same, and the talking points are a lot easier to discuss because they are mostly general information that you would be able to speak to quite easily. Unless you really click with someone, or get involved in a group discussion over a common interest (ie. Game of Thrones or another show, Football or another sport, Dota or another game, etc, etc, etc.), the conversation doesn't really need to move past the basics of ""Who, what, when, where, why and how"".

The thing you're curious about is still the person. ""Hi, I'm marin. Who are you?""  
The common thing you have is the event/location. What brings them here? How do they know [person, if house or birthday party]? What do they do for a living? What part of town do they live/work in? What would they be doing tonight if they weren't at this party? Do they like [profession interest, activity, show, book series, sport, game, artist, music genre, etc. that you really like]? Do you have any other common interests? Has this conversation been pleasant? Would you consider another conversation with this person? Do they have a business card, website, or email to contact them with?  

Ultimately, with a stranger, what you are interested in is ""Is this someone I want to keep as a stranger, or someone who I want to become a coworker/friend?"" In many cases one may be networking for business contacts, potential clients, etc. as well, but I'm working with the idea that you aren't interested in strangers. That's fine, I'm not really either - but I like my friends, and it would be great to have more people like them in my life. Being curious is a good way to find out if someone will fit into your life as a friend or not and transition from a stranger you don't care about into a friend you are interested in.

**Disclaimer:** There are tonnes of more qualified people to talk with about this, I'm only offering my opinion based on my own anecdotal experiences. I'm a fairly big guy, have a beard, dress pretty plainly. I stand straight, put away my phone when people address me, look people in the eye without staring them down, I smile, I laugh a lot, and I ask questions about what people tell me and then nod and smile while people answer them and offer a follow up point or question so it can be corrected or expanded upon because most people love to talk about themselves - or they will ask me a question instead and I'll just be honest in my response.  
I don't like networking or mingling events and don't really try and actively talk with anyone. However, if you do what I've outlined in this disclaimer it seems that you will be unable to prevent people from coming and talking to you even if you're just wandering in circles throughout a space trying to run down the clock until you leave. 

So, employ with caution - you may end up with a few new friends... or you might just have a bunch of strangers coming up to you and talking all night.

EDIT: Side benefit to positive mingling experiences is positive second-hand ratings. ""PreparedBody? Yeah.. I met them at Jeffcallahan3's thread thing a while ago. Seemed like a really genuine person - really direct without typing out huge text walls like marin4rasauce does a lot of the time. If you're considering them I would definitely recommend contacting them!"""

soc_579913,socialskills,reddit_comment,597,"You need to step out of your comfort zone. I know its hard abd we feel like we need people validation to be allowed to speak, but socializing is about social cues, especially with women. I do agree we tend to go for funny guys? But honestly not always. I just dont think you have found the right person for you or people who understand you, or your past. You can bring up things with the guys you work with surrounding work, or talk about sports you guys like, or anything else till you hit somethig you guys have in common. You obviously are not stupid if you got the job and what holds you back is your self pity and insecurity. People can handle being around people who are not funny! If people tend to not stay long is because they can send the negativity and brooding that you give out (it isnt your fault) but often the body lamguage can throw people off and they might feel like they bother you instead. 

It is hard to let go of the past but that already happened and where you are headed now is up to you. Online dating barely works for anyone, i know plenty of “funny, partying,hot” people who can not get a decent match, and when they do the persons a flake or pure trash. STOP comparin yourself to other, id being analytical and “not” funny is you, then own it, we are not all the same and we all deserve peace and happiness. You should see your job and determination as something to be grateful about and not a burden, your career will take you far even if you dont feel like you are there yet. Podcasts saves lives, honestly you can find some on socializing , approaching women, stepping out of your comfort zone, etc. Joining things that you enjoy or wxploring things you always say no to can help you on meeting people and gaining those life experiences that you need. I think your sense of not belonging comes from a negative past and you subconcipusly blame yourself for it, it was not your fault and you are funny, whenyou meet the right people and break free from your chains that humour WILL come out. There are times were i have nothing to give , no love , humour... nothing. That goes away and then i can do that all again, its just a mindset created by bad experiences that causes you to believe youre worth nothing and arent funny or likeable. 

Im not an expert in any of this, but i would love reaching out further if you want someone to talk to. I know how hard being in a dark place is and feeling like you are just stuck and that no one likes you, you are worth than you know, ans you are smart, and likeable, youre just holding yourself back. I hope this helps, it defintely is a tough road but even something as simple as discussing the news will ease from small conversation to someyhing more meaningful and  you can map out other topics from there, or even at a outing just discuss the place and ask how someone elses night is going, i tend questions help conversations go a long way. Especially when you show interest in the other persons replies, and 100% body language, seems like you struggle with this and thag takes practice, a mirror will be a big help, practicing conversations helps so much even if that sounds silly.

All in all, you have to decide if it is acceptable for you to always have to start a conversation. And up to which point in your relationship it would be acceptable.

Secondly, I would say that neither of you are clearly in the wrong, you both have different ideals and beliefs. The best way to go around this is to have a conversation with your dad about your passions and ideals. You have to find a common ground between both of you. Dads are stubborn people, but mostly just want what’s best for their kids, it’s clear that what he thinks is best for you is from his own experience, which can be helpful in its own right.

soc_1614880,socialskills,reddit_comment,363,"Maybe I can help telling you what helped me. (But everyone is different, so you have to see for yourself) Some different advices which might help:

1. Start accepting yourself, so it is easier to live with these hard feelings. Start with accepting some of your thoughts or feelings. (accepting means to accept that they are their. You don't have to like your thougts.) For example, you start accept that you are insecure at the moment in social situations. When you start accepting it and doesn't fight it, it is easier to work on it (paradoxically) 

2. Mindfulness can help you to concentrate better on conversations and are less bothered by your thoughts. (Good book for that ""The confidence gap:From fear to freedom)

3. In general work on your self-esteem. A good book for that is ""the six pillars of self-esteem"". This book is a litte bit dry, but it helps to understand what self-esteem is and how to obtain it. Especially the chapter about self-acceptance helped me a lot. (Maybe finding a summary in the internet can help, too)

4. Try to do small stuff, even if you don't feel ready. For example greet people, even if you are insecure. If you do actions, which are slightly risky for you, you will extend your comfort zone step by step. It is important, that you accept your feelings of shame and anxiety and nervousness (which you will feel. That is normal, when doing stuff you are not used, too) It is okay to feels this way! With time it will get better, but only if you do small steps. And small risky things are enough, more brave stuff can be done later when you feel more brave.

5. Also it can help to speak with others about your problems, maybe speaking with a good friend, familar member, doctor, therapist. It can be good to have a different perspective. Especially psycho-therapists can help, since they are trained for that.

6. New thoughts (like acceptance of feelings) need time. There is a thing called neuroplasticity, which means thoughts will get easier to think and feel more natural when you think them more often (very simplified\^\^)."

They were always feeling awkward and unhappy because they never felt they fit in. They had to work harder to find themselves. But college was an opportunity to totally reinvent themselves. They got to start with a totally clean slate. They made new friends, and the freedom and responsibility came easily to them. It felt good to be a whole new person. Some people have the opposite experience. They found their spot in grade school, with people who understood them and treated them well. And lost it when they went to college. Everyone is different. 

What you need to remember is, you're not the only one who isn't who you used to be. If they want to still judge you that way, let them. It says more about their personal growth than it says about you. You are a new person now and they should be too. You've grown up and they should have as well. So just be who you are.

My friends/family will comment on it and it’s ironic because I’m probably more of an introvert than I appear to be.  However, I have learned my experiences that I don’t really want a million friends.  I just want to connect and vibe with people that get me and I get them and we connect on some level.

In terms of how to talk to people I would advise you to not care what they think and just go for it.  I like to make jokes when I first meet people about things that are observational and are a little funny/odd.  It doesn’t work for everyone but it’s my sense of humor and if someone doesn’t like it I don’t care because I feel like I’m being my authentic self. Basically that’s my ice breaker.

Obviously, things like inside jokes won't work and you may want to avoid any racy or **too** offensive jokes (unless of course, you end up playing Cards Against Humanity... at which point anything goes) but be friendly. Open up a little bit (without spilling any emotional baggage anywhere, of course) and people will usually open up to you.

*Yes, ignoring other peoples opinions is easier said than done. Typically, nervousness in situations like this is the product of fear - fear of disapproval, being disliked, whatever. Evolutionarily, this fear was perfectly logical. It kept you alive. In this context, it's a burden. Odds are, these people disliking you will not result in you starving to death or being eaten by tigers or something. Now, it doesn't matter. Once you start to push yourself beyond that and actually start talking to people, the fear will go away - or at least subside long enough for you to enjoy yourself."
soc_1256114,socialskills,reddit_comment,140,"What Real_Vents said. This is a violation of your material boundaries - your stuff is your stuff, and deciding who to share your stuff with is your choice. And just so we are on the same page, let's define boundaries real quick: they are a safeguard to overextending yourself, they communicate acceptable and unacceptable behaviors in a relationship, they are parameters for knowing what to expect in relationships.

What is more, what are the background rates? How many times has your friend stolen money from you? If it's only once, maybe you have boundaries that are too rigid (think tough, much like a steel box). Rigid boundaries look like this: cutting people off, never sharing, building walls, enforcing strict rules.

I'm sorry to hear about what happened to you OP.

Emojis just let people know what's your facial expression when u send the message.

For example: ""gee thanks =)""  verses ""gee thanks :("" 
Same words but emos give it a different meaning, one expresses happy to a response, while the other expresses disappointment.

But to be honest, its silly because I meet people that get annoyed that I  use too many emojis, so it depends on who you are talking to. Dry for one person might be fine for someone else. 

So for that person, just spam a shit ton of emojis, that will show them just how much swag you got."

The professional setting ""script"" isn't necessarily something I found, but something that I was taught at school. I did an internship program where we specifically talked about how to be professional and answer interview questions and stuff like that. Also, professional settings are ""easy"" because they're straightforward and (relatively) predictable.   


Speaking with people outside of that is difficult because everyone is different, nothing is straightforward or predictable, and saying the wrong thing could completely destroy any potential bond that could come from it. I guess it often feels like navigating a minefield, except I have a horrible tendency to step on the wrong place and blow everything up"
soc_1701633,socialskills,reddit_comment,355,"I feel the exact same. I’m very particular and random with who I find attractive so it’s not often I see a guy and am like wow he’s hot. When I have dated or talked to guys I like physically in the past I find that they’re usually cheaters because women throw themselves at them and their personalities are always off because they’ve been told their whole lives they’re attractive which I’m my case always ends up with a very douchey man who is extremely cocky and arrogant, usually making it clear they assume I’m drooling over them or want to immediately sleep with them. In other words they’re always fuckbois lol. Being completely honest (and this is depressing af) I genuinely don’t believe there are really attractive men out there who are also good partners, loyal, interested in others instead of always talking about themselves, etc etc. I mean intellectually I know out of billions of people on this planet they obviously exist but I think of it as hitting a powerball jackpot; if you find one it’s both incredibly lucky and rare to accomplish. Dating the past two years it must just be bad luck on my part but I’ve started feeling more and more that all the amazing men out there have prob already been scooped up because I haven’t met a single guy who isn’t either a mess, a flake, or just looking to hook up and giving me a bs speech about how he wants a family when his nickname is widely known as “perro” (dog in Spanish as he’s Latino). I have little faith in men at this point and I feel like the bar is very low
Sometimes. A lot of it is I’m not working, I’m renovating my house to sell in a few months and the only place to meet men seem to be at bars and that’s never turned out well lol. I’m on bumble and it’s the same there as well. A good guy seems harder to find now than ever but that’s just my perspective I’m not a man hater or anything lol"
soc_1048983,socialskills,reddit_comment,524,"I’m fat, but I try to look nice and wear flattering clothes. One time there were three teenage boys giggling as I walked by. I was sure they were talking about me. Then I heard one of them say, “Why would she wear that. She looks like a beached whale.” It was mortifying snd hurt me to the core.

Here’s the thing. I’m fat, but I know my outfit looked great. It fit me well, flattered me in the right places and had a nice print. Although hurtful at the time, (I cried in my car) it meant nothing after awhile. That’s because I decided that the only opinions I care about are those who are close to me. They matter. If they thought that shirt didn’t look good, they’d tell me in a kind way, if they even told me at all.

It must be horrible walking around, thinking you are a walking joke. Honestly, the only opinions that matter are from those closest to you though. It’s probably not happening as much as you think, but even if it is. You’ve got to stop letting them, those strangers, have power over you.

I’m 100% sure people laugh at me or think I’m weird a lot. I’m a 44 year old woman who’s clothing explodes with color and I wear cute little ponytails even though I have short hair. Sometimes I put matching bows. Dressing like that makes me happy though. Carrying my sparkly unicorn purse makes me happy. I’m not going to go around dressing in black hoodies and skinny jeans like everyone else because I’m happy the way I am. In fact, the other day a woman in her 20’s was being rude to me (long story) and said, “ why do you wear your hair like that? It looks really stupid.” This was in front of a large crowd of people. I had a glimpse of shame, but I stopped that and told her, “because I like bows. They are cute and cute stuff makes me happy.” The look on her face was priceless! She was shocked that her bullying didn’t work.

Bottom line: Be proud of who you are. Dress how you feel happy. I’m pretty sure everyone isn’t staring at you judging you and laughing. It may feel that way, but tbh, people are so self-absorbed they probably don’t even notice you. For those that do laugh and point, your choice is to ignore it or confront them. I confronted that girl because she was in my face with her comment. Confronting random people can be, at the very least unsavory, but could be dangerous. My suggestion is to ignore them and work on building your self esteem through self-care, possible therapy, self-help books, talking to people you trust, etc...

Here’s a quote from one of my favorite movies:

You are kind
You are smart
You are important

Repeat that to yourself when you are having negative thoughts. Look in the mirror and say that ten times per day if you have to. You are a valuable and worthy person. It’s time you started treating yourself that way."
soc_929600,socialskills,reddit_comment,176,"It really depends on your needs, do you think something is lacking in your life? I don’t think what you’re experiencing is a problem unless it is, if you know what I mean. It depends how you feel.

There’s no one way to be, everyone is a little different. So you need to investigate on how you feel, journaling is great for that.

But I’m guessing if you’re not talking about your own issues it might be because you simply don’t need to, nothing wrong with that. Or it could be that you’re not capable of confronting your own issues or that it’s something you prefer doing on your own. Nothing wrong with these either. You really just need to investigate your feelings and see if something is lacking, then make a decision based on that.

But what would be a “problem” is if you need to talk about your issues but find no one to confide in. Or if you take the time to listen to people but they don’t do the same for you."
soc_1385311,socialskills,reddit_comment,399,"I tend to put up with a lot of shit from jobs/people not because it doesn't bother me, but because I see their opinions and needs as more important than my own. It's taken a lot of work to grow out of that mindset and start standing up for myself and stop being a pushover. I once called in sick to work, had my boss call me and tell me to get my butt over there and so I did,, and I worked for 6 hours in obvious and intense pain till I collapsed on the bathroom floor crying. I drove myself to the hospital and had to have emergency surgery. I quit, but I gave them two weeks and thanked them for letting me take so much time off to recover. I have a deep seated need to prove that I'm good enough or responsible enough, and when people appreciate my hard work, it feels good for a minute and then I feel like I need to work twice as hard to earn their appreciation because I really didn't deserve it. I tend to cry easily when frustrated, and hate myself for it. Receiving any sort of criticism drops my self-worth in the toilet, so I try my best to be un-criticisable. I tend to cry or have panic attacks when asking my lovely partner for any sort of help (around the house, etc....), despite knowing that it's not a big deal and that he's happy to help/do his fair share. I tend to be conflict avoidant because I'd rather stifle my own feelings than bring up that I feel hurt, thereby hurting someone else's feelings. I see my valid feelings as not a big deal, and something I should just get over. Bottling that shit up sometimes causes me to feel like really small things are a bigger deal than they are/should be, because I treat the big hurts the same way I treat the small ones.  The list goes on and on...

That being said, I can recognize these harmful traits, and I know that I have the power to change them. I've made really good strides from where I started, and I'll keep making them. Life is change, and if you're not changing with it, you need to reevaluate yourself a bit imo. The hurt might always be there but it shouldn't be a crutch."
soc_616047,socialskills,reddit_comment,377,"By being happy to be who you are. By allowing others to see your wants, ideas, perspectives, the things you like, the things you dislike. Be proud to be yourself. Be proud to be who you are. 

Embrace other people for who they are. Their personalities, likes, dislikes, perspectives, ideas, philosophies. Learn to love and respect other people as the rational conscious human beings they are. Just like you. We all share this thing called “consciousness.” We are all able to take in this reality through our senses, and to make judgements about this reality. No animal or plant has the ability to rationally and consciously operate in the world. We are unified in this and that connects you with everyone else.

Confidence is being yourself. Confidence is being unapologetic about being yourself. Confidence is being able to share who you are with others without anxiety. Without moderating it because you think you will be judged for it. Confidence is the lack of fear of being judged. Lack of anxiety.

The person you are is a perfectly acceptable person. Sure, nobody is perfect, but it is up to you to identify what you do not like about yourself and change it. YOU decide who you are, nobody else. You’re living this life, trying to fit into some mould that you think society demands you to fit into. But that’s not the way it is.

People like people who are themselves freely without fear and anxiety.

Be free and open up. You can always introspect into your own mind, and make decisions about who you are, make changes in the way you act. But you should be making those decisions based on your own rational assessment of yourself and how you want to live life and pursue your happiness. Do not think that society aims to control you. Society likes people who are okay with themselves. When you are comfortable with yourself, other people can be comfortable with you.

Edit: Basically confidence isn’t real. “Confidence” is just your natural state. When you fall from your natural state, it is because of anxiety. Confidence is hownyoure supposed to be. Anxiety is mental illness. I suffer from it too. It hurts me every day but I fucking fight that shit."

soc_1025526,socialskills,reddit_comment,980,"So there are things that can be considered right and wrong actions during this pandemic that were never morally in question before, and what those are have evolved or changed or become evident or been disproved as time passed and more research was done. They've also been arbitrarily quantified because they need to be, in practice, like you could make the argument that it's immoral to stand 1.9 meters from someone and wear a mask that you've used for 1 minute over recommended safe usage, not because those centimeters or minutes mean anything but because there needed to be a line drawn somewhere. Also in some places as lockdown eased in my country there was a recommendation for keeping an arbitrary number of people in a social group and not intermingling outside that group, not because one more person would be the straw to break the camel's back and suddenly you're a danger, but in an analogue world you need to decide on a practical limit rather than 6.38 people being the ideal safe number of people to stay ""safe"". 

The thing is before all the guidelines were developed there wasn't a moral question. You could plead ignorance, because it's not intuitive at all that 2 meters is the magic number, or that civilians need to wear surgical masks, and even then new dilemmas arise, because it's easy to assume that if you wear a mask you can be in closer contact, and the advice is that you should stick to the magic distance. Who would've thought, right? The point is, your personal responsibility is to know, to keep yourself 100% informed and even ahead of the curve. But. The lines are arbitrary. Should you have been wearing a mask and working from home back in July of last year, you may plead ignorance then because who would've imagined what December would bring, but there are resources out there that predicted a pandemic, just not how or when. You made your choices to ignore that then not because you're a terrible person, but because even without a degree in statistics you recognised it was a very favourable numbers game, in that odds truly were that you didn't need to be constantly prepared for a possible apocalypse. You should be, to some extent, prepared for anything. We wear seatbelts in cars, we keep first aid kits in the bathroom, based on our understanding of risk. 

That hasn't changed today. COVID epidemiology is under great scrutiny, so we have a lot more numbers than a day to day risk to base our actions on, but it remains relative and it remains dynamic. Maybe you could mathematically quantify how stupid your friends were, but those same numbers quantify how not-stupid they were. Like creating a 10% risk of transmission means 90% odds that there's no risk. So maybe they did weigh up the risks, and then it becomes personal opinion whether or not the risk was justified, since the numbers don't answer that question they just inform it. Is 11% too risky? What about 12%? I'm all for moral absolutes, but the modern luxury of numbers are a blessing, and a curse in this regard. Some risk is objectively acceptable, because we all still don't live in boats in case of flooding. More risk is acceptable in different circumstances, like breaking the speed limit if you've got a friend with a cut artery bleeding out in the passenger seat, but maybe not if you've got food poisoning and are trying to get to a toilet. There's an upper limit to that as well, because if you build your house out of cardboard a slight breeze will knock it down, and if you drive at insane speeds to get your dying friend to the hospital you'll probably end up killing both of you and someone else because you'll lose control and crash. 

So, maybe your friends made a judgment you don't agree with, but you won't be able to mathematically define your high ground. The risk in judging them is hypocricy, of course,  but it also shuts down any path to understand their reasoning. Maybe they were just wilfully ignorant, or (less-likely) honestly so, because even in 2020 not everyone lives on the Internet or television, so it's possible to avoid the breaking news that 2.25 meters is actually the best distance and everyone who is under that basically hates old people and wants them all to die. Maybe you can judge them for wilful ignorance, because if they were open to being informed maybe they would come to the same conclusion as you that the risk of going to a party is not justifiable, or maybe not, as I suggested above. In my opinion that's an easier judgment to make, because the stakes are too high these days to stick your head in the sand, even if your actions don't change based on the information you're wilfully hiding from. That's just being average at best, lazy at worst, dangerously lazy by whatever numbers they're missing out on.

That's just my middle of the night train of thought, if you hadn't structured your path to judgment this way maybe it would be useful to you, and maybe I'm wrong, but I definitely think structure to the way you think about things like this is useful rather than going with your instincts. Instincts aren't the best authority, they've probably formed from information you've gathered mostly passively in the past 11 months or so after all, that's pretty short as far as day-to-day experience goes. You will probably save a lot of face if you're slow and methodical to cast judgment and humble in doing so, and there may even be no judgment to cast, just a difference in opinion because difference in personality, and you can't do anything but nod and move on.

Stay safe."

I mean, people see a different you than you do, they don't feel the things you feel, or think the things you think. They only see the things you do. And you claim that you haven't done anything, but this is not strictly true. You have stayed relatively still, from an outside perspective, maybe. But people don't judge you based in that. In fact, to be still for much of your life, is something quite special to many people. Because we know that to be still, is a precursor to great movement. To understand stillness is to only finally be able to move when there is a very powerful force behind it. And now you are talking about the desire to change, which is the most powerful thing a person can realize.

So I want to tell you about a parable of a twisted tree. In the middle of an ancient village there is a huge, ancient, knobbly, twisted tree. A villager asked a monk why it was the only tree left in the village. What was so special or sacred about this tree? And the monk answered that all of the other trees had been cut down. Straight and tall trees make great boards for furniture.

So instead of thinking about what you *would* have done, as a typical boring (but straight and tall) tree, being turned into boards by the march of currency and usefulness, realize that you are truly a wonky tree that has avoided a lot of the annoyances of life thus far. And that is something beautiful to be respected.

It is your choice now whether to live the rest of your life in peace as a knobbly, wise old tree, or to choose to extend a slender branch to the community of the desperate so that they may make a bow out of it.

Your life is your choice. And it is your choice whether you give a piece of it to another or not. Make that choice wisely, not out of desperation or fear. Good luck."

soc_947365,socialskills,reddit_comment,647,"Ok here it all is :)


Hey I’m sorry about your situation. I know how this feels and it’s so hard cause humans are made for relationships. I can totally understand how it can impact your mental health. 

I think the first thing is to reflect on your mindset... do you think you’ll never be able to make friends in the future or are you optimistic? In order for changes to happen you have to be your number one supporter. So start thinking phrases like. “RIGHT NOW I’m struggling with making friends, but that doesn’t mean it will last forever.” “I don’t know how to make new friends YET... but with time and practice I can be amazing.” “Whatever social skills I’m lacking rn I can work hard and gain.” This is so important to have this mindset. How can we truly become who we want if we don’t believe we CAN change? 


Ok so now that huge thing is out of the way here’s some more tips:

Figure out your passions and talents. From there join a sports team, clubs, programs, classes, Reddit forums lol... The thing is to be around people who have similar interests because that is an easy way to make connections. Friendships work by having connections, showing interest, and making time for them. When you get involved just be yourself, if you’re funny, embrace that with some funny comments. If someone responds, laughs, or shows interest then remember that and they may be a good person to start with. If you’re nice then embrace that! If you’re quirky then embrace that! Whatever you are like, embrace that! See who is responsive to you, your actions, or comments. They will be the easiest to start a conversation with. 

Once you have someone who’s showing interest then introduce yourself when its a good time. “Hey man, I’m new here, my name is ....... Can I work on this with you/ practice with you/ or whatever is relevant for the occasion you’re at.” From there you can ask how long they’ve been doing that hobby, or what grade they’re in. Here’s some great convo topics for when you just met:

- what’s your name lol
- what grade are you in
- what electives are you taking (if that’s relevant)
-  Ask topics related to the interest you both share!!! So for example, I just looked on your profile to make this easier lol. I see you like art, so you can ask people what’s their favorite art medium. Who their favorite art teacher at the school is. You can ask them how long they’ve been making art. Or just complement their work! Showing interest is the important thing. 

Honestly, on paper is may sound easy but we all makes mistakes! You’ll also learn though trail and error. And that’s great! Understand that mistakes will be made and think of it as a learning opportunity. 

Ok so from here you can start watching YouTube videos on specific social problems you are still struggling with. Or if you want specific tips for super specific occasions. 

Some people are just not interested in making new friends (for whatever reason) but there are tons who are always looking for new cool people. You seem really nice so I think you should embrace that! Be genuinely kind to people around you. There will be a lot of times where it’ll go unnoticed but not always. Having a good heart is so attractive and people will be drawn to that.

There will be people who you meet and eventually fallout with. That is so normal in life. But there will be some people you meet who will have this instant connection. Those are the ones you spend your time and effort on. 

At the end of the day, everyone is different but everyone is looking for connections, love, and acknowledgment."
soc_648472,socialskills,reddit_comment,120,"Take people's word here with a grain of salt. It's /r/socialskills, so many people are bitter and angry.

Just my perspective, but it's not being ""nice"" that is looked down upon. It's being weak. People respect you if you're a competent, secure individual. 

It's kind of complicated. If being nice is your personality, it means you don't have much going for you. There's a reason people like banter. Banter isn't being mean, but it isn't being nice exactly. Being completely nice 100% of the time makes you kind of one-dimensional. Having a personality often means you're kind of disagreeable and edgy at times.

soc_926252,socialskills,reddit_comment,280,"Consider this: you are no longer her friend but her caretaker.  And what you are feeling is caretaker burnout.  Which happens to all caretakers, because being responsible for another human being is *hard*.

In your case, it is also unhealthy for both of you.  She is not an invalid, genuinely unable to take care of herself.  The kindest thing you could do for her is not to solve all her problems, but to support her to solve her problems by herself.  

For example, you have gotten used to ask around for her.  Encourage her to ask around for herself.  If she responds with panic and confusion, wait out the panic (help her calm herself if you know how; if not, just wait sympathetically).  Then once that burst of emotion has died down, walk her through the necessary steps.  Help her practice what to say if she needs the practice.  Encourage her and be her biggest cheerleader.  But do not do it for her.

Honestly, it really worries me that she 'freaks out' at you for not knowing.  You should be able to be honest with her about your limits without being guilted or berated or having to endure outbursts.  Please try to tell her that you need her to stop this.  If she does not respect your request, you really should take a giant step back from her.  Much as you want to care for her, you do not owe it to her, and you will not be able to do it when exhausted anyway.  Protect your own mental health before you try to save another's, much the same as you put on your own oxygen mask before assisting others."

Surprisingly, this often opens others up to you (think how you feel when someone invites you or puts effort into getting to know you!). 

I’m often anxious (don’t know if you’re the anxious type), so I often have to tell myself - “you’re ok. They’re ok. Everything’s ok. Listen. And respond. No one is expecting you to be the best/worst. You’re ok as you are.”  This helps me gets past some of my social awkwardness...not all of it, but enough to connect with people as I talk with them (and helps me from slipping into unfriendly habits...  being a “know-it-all” or boasting or overly negative...) 

Good luck on your friendship endeavors! "
soc_702583,socialskills,reddit_comment,302,"Okay, the fact that you're making such a ridiculous accusation about what that means in a relationship if it were to come about cheating. I think most of, if not every single person, would have a problem with being cheat on by their significant other. Are You just being facetious with that? Come on, I'm pretty positive you get what I mean. 

That conversation was not any of these things. The person seemed to a show a general concern and thought that maybe you making jokes like that meant that you were depressed and actually suicidal. They were showing general concern for you. Considering that you're taking a personality label seriously is quite ridiculous too. Those personality tests don't really say much. It's just an overgeneralization because everyone is different and you can't just put people in a box like that. It's almost insulting to think that you were saying certain things to this person because they are an INTP. Is that how you want to be treated?

Don't even understand what the boundary or ultimatum here is. It looks like a general conversation but one person explaining how they make jokes and another one expressing concern over them from not understanding the joke. They even said they couldn't really read things through text so it made it difficult for them to understand your jokes. Some people have issues reading sarcasm and you definitely can't tell tone of voice or facial expressions when it's a texting conversation. So where's the boundary or ultimatum in this?

You offered not to say those kinds of things to them and they said no, that you can be yourself and say those things ,they just couldn't read it through text. So I seriously don't see what the problem is with this conversation in the least bit."

Question is, how do you connect with people? Some tips, shoot innocent banter

Example scenario:

Club is doing some speed friending ice breaker, you meet the first person. ""Oh man, these ice breakers aren't usually my thing. I usually find them kind of awkward. I'm ____, what's your name?""


make a small genuine compliment and spring it into a question:

""Oh hey, I like that shirt, is it from ____?""


I use to be really socially awkward, but I decided to face my awkwardness head on and just pushed myself really far out of my comfort zone.

soc_535278,socialskills,reddit_comment,298,"I suffer with this too. 

What has actually helped me a ton is this: 

I realized at some point that people have a list in their head of what is important to them. Like their family, friends, loved ones. Or things that distress them like their self image, health, paying the bills, some drama situation in their life, etc. 

These things are all in our heads and we care about them A LOT. They take up a bunch of space in our heads like hard drives on a computer. Most of us don’t have the space in our heads to add more things to care about such as how a random person in public looks. They could make *observations* about us and then forget about it 10 seconds later because it doesn’t matter that much to them. Or they could make legit *judgements* about us, however how much weight they place about that judgement is tiny tiny tiny like 0.1% in their head. The rest of the 99.9% of their head are things they care about in their life, things that are much more important to them. And they’ll probably forget about that judgement 10 seconds later and never give it another thought. They don’t have room in their head to care that much about a random person they see. 

This has alleviated a lot of stress and anxiety I have being in public when people are looking at me. Sure they might judge sometimes, but they don’t care about that judgement about me nearly as much as I think it does. Which has been really freeing to me. I’m not 100% perfect yet, but I’m significantly a lot better. 

That’s just me though. Everyone is different of corse. Just thought I’d share. And remember you’re not alone!"

I want my relationships to stay intact but I either 1) don't think to get a hold of anyone. 2) don't try to because I don't know what I would talk about, or 3) try to talk to them but have an awkward engagement with them. 

That's all pretty irrelevant, but here's the thing. You have to make an effort to talk to people, because even if you don't miss them or don't feel as though your relationship has changed, they might. I've had this happen. I go to visit every now and then and certain people that I had great relationships with months before are awkward, as if we've seen eachother around but never really talked or if we had a bad break-up. It's completely up to you though.

Otherwise, you will find more frustrations instead of romance.

soc_150813,socialskills,reddit_comment,342,"- You don't **know know** that everyone had a picturesque life in grade 12. Plenty don't. Whether you have a bunch of good friends depends on luck, the local social culture, and being stationed in the same geographical area for a long time. 

- Lack of friends does not necessarily reflect badly on you or indicate you are not likeable. There are plenty of factors that get in the way, but that doesn't mean you aren't a wonderful person to befriend. So never think you can't do it because you haven't done it yet.

- Take a lesson from young adults with asthma: 

    Some feel embarassed about it and act like it is taboo, they act that way and their friends end up finding it weird, which will feed into the young adult feeling like it *is* embarrassing. Others embrace it and simply explain their condition to their friends as if discussing how to ride a bike if their friends ask, and they build a loving and supportive social network around them.

- If you start trying to make friends now, if you fail you can recover in university and also learn from your mistakes during this time. If you start trying to make friends in university, you don't have the luxury of failing and feeling okay with it. It is ultimately your decision, sit down with a pros and cons list in your own time.

- From my own experience, definitely establish a support network of close, reliable friends before you even think about dating. If you dated your only friend, who will catch you when you break up? If they turned out to be abusive who can you go to? That sort of thing. 

- Keep in mind abusive romantic partners also tend to isolate people from a support network, so once you have friends don't stop seeing them because you've found a *really hot, wonderful, and caring bf/gf that wants to marry you and fulfill your dreams*. Because it may just be the case that you've found an abuser."

If this is your approach, you may try having a heart-to-heart with him to explain how his actions have made you feel. Perhaps come to an agreement to try to support and build each other up (this is something that I've seen come naturally with good friends) both personally and privately.

The important thing however is to practice self-care. However you decide to address it, either by seeking new people or trying to improve the existing circle, you are allowed to prioritize your own sense of identity.

soc_440751,socialskills,reddit_comment,235,"It sounds like one solution you could do to avoid confrontation is to ask your mom to celebrate your birthday and Father's Day separately. Assuming you and your mom are on good terms, I think she would respect your decision to not want to celebrate them at the same time. Then you can weed out whether your mom wants to invite the family because it's Father's Day, or because of your birthday. If your mom still decides she wants to invite the family over on your birthday, you should tell her you don't want to do anything big for the day and don't want to invite a lot of people over.

If you don't want to go down that route at all you'll need to talk to your mom and tell her about what happened with your ex-friends. It isn't even really a confrontation, you're just talking to her. Again, assuming you're on good terms, she should understand and hopefully be able to work out a solution with you. It might be cheesy to say, but she loves you. There are going to be so many other social situations that happen in your life when you'll have to stand up to a boss, coworker, stranger, etc. This is your mom, and if you can work something out with her then its just the first step to getting used to standing up for yourself.

soc_1131908,socialskills,reddit_comment,491,"Actually my guy it’s as simple and as difficult as learning to socialize. I’m saying this as a gamer myself since the age of 7-8. I had a over bearing mother that didn’t want me to learn bad habits so she wouldnt let me hang with friends so that hampered my socializing skills, didn’t have a father figure to learn from and with these two along with severe anxiety, being over weight led me to turn to gaming to help me deal with life as a loner. I had to literally force myself to interact with others and it took months and even years to slowly get used to talking with strangers. Part of my drive was that I wanted to get laid. That part of course isn’t the best reason to want to socialize but it was a good enough reason that I kept on enduring to hopefully make that happen one day. 

So I kept torturing myself feeling that creepy anxiety wash over me making my heart rate creep up, body heat and would sweat so much to where I would soak my shirt and it would be visible which lead to more anxiety. It was a vicious cycle that I endured for years and I would relapse and go back to gaming and then I would steel my resolve and try against. At some points I would think I was going insane to keep putting myself through this but idk I just kept doing it and eventually I did get better at things I could now chat with servers or cashiers and just do small talk. I asked for women’s numbers and got shot down so many times. Eventually i did go on dates which is another can of anxiety opening up overthinking things and self sabotaging etc. Yet another thing I wasn’t experienced with but I trucked through it and dealt with the unpleasant feelings. What I want to get across is that it isn’t sunshine and rainbows to learn to socialize but definitely don’t give up on it man just take your time read self help books and as long as you don’t give up you’ll get there. And one of the best things I’ve learned is that you own your own life don’t worry about the time frame bc everyone is different and gets to these points at different times. 

Some of the books I read that helped me is how to make friends and influence people by dale Carnegie this one helps by just finding basic questions to get people talking about themselves bc I’ve found out that many people love talking and you can use it to sorta hang back and get used to someone else doing all the talking and you can add bits of your own as you feel comfortable.

I think most of the anxiety comes from feeling like people are looking at you and judging you for being alone -- or feeling awkward and not knowing where to look/what to do when you're used to filling that space with conversation with friends.

But when I go out I started noticing when other people were sitting at the bar alone or eating alone -- I barely noticed them. I was so busy in my own conversation with my friends that I was in my own world. I think that was the most freeing thing to realize, that people are so busy worrying about themselves that they don't have time to worry about you.

Bring a book or a journal, or even a crossword puzzle or something to occupy yourself without having to scroll on your phone the whole time, or go to a bar with a TV so you can watch that. Going alone often allows you to strike up conversation with the bartenders or people feel more comfortable coming up to you versus approaching a whole friend group.

soc_212486,socialskills,reddit_comment,248,"The thing about sarcasm is that it is **incredibly polarising**. People who like sarcasm *really love it*. People who don't *really hate it*. These type of jokes will force people into one of the two camps: either they will really like you or really hate you.

It is up to you to decide how to proceed. If you are willing to find new friends, you can stay acting yourself and make really good friends who like you for who you are. If this is your choice, front-load your personality. Since sarcasm is either a huge positive, or a huge negative, you want people to know what they are getting right off the back.

The other option is if you don't want to be sarcastic. The main problem with sarcasm is that it comes from a place of disassociation. *You are too stupid to understand what I am saying, and if I were to tell you directly, you would misconstrue it and take offense, completely missing the point.* The problem is actually the emotions you give: I don't care about you (most communication is tone and body language). So you want to target that and push your mind into really caring about trying to understand their position. This means that you listen to them fully, and re-explain what they are trying to say. If you are intelligent, this will be difficult since you probably understand what they are trying to explain, before they finish explaining it. Hold your tongue."

I have done lots of thinking about it and simply put i am a completely different person when on the ""job."" 

Sure the first few weeks of any job I have had where a little uneasy, but once I understand what it is I need to do I change. At work I am confident I know what it is I need to do and I do it. If i need to tell people what to do, I tell them. If I need to back off and let them figure it out then I do that. At work I am an Alpha. I am a social person. I ask people about their day. Get to know people as co workers. Have no problem talking to upper management, or complete strangers. That's how its always been when I am at work.

Outside of work is different. Life is difficult I don't know what I am doing, and I'm not confident. Outside of work I'm not an alpha. I can't talk to people, and I mostly stay at home. Outside of work, no matter how hard I try it's like i can't find a purpose, and that has been a real eye opener for me.

Purpose breeds confidence. People that have a purpose in my opinion seem to have more confidence in themselves. At work I know what to do, I have a purpose, and I have no trouble fulfilling that role. But outside of work, without a purpose In society I fall short.

soc_240828,socialskills,reddit_comment,329,"&gt;I always tell myself ""Ok the next time will be different."" Only, it never is

What I would recommend is that you change your approach. Whatever you've been doing so far is giving you the same outcome. 

There's this quote I read in a book years ago, and it isn't anything fancy at all but I find it to be 100% accurate, it's helped me in many different situations in life:

""If you always do what you've always done, you will always get what you've always got""

Basically I interpret that to mean don't expect a different outcome if you always do the same thing.

I recommend you use a technique called 'weaving' its the best way to keep a conversation going. If its one on one, you have to listen, you have to create a connection, even if you don't like the person. Weaving example:

Him: Hey hows it going, did you have a good weekend?

Her: Yeah kinda, I had to wait in for the cable guy on Saturday which was annoying!

Him: I feel you, that's happened to me so many times I lost count

Her: I really wished he didn't ruin my Saturday though, I wanted to go to the beach.

Him: Oh the beach, so are you one of those sunbathing types or you like to spend your time in the water...?

And so on.... I know it looks like a pointless conversation, but I'm just displaying the way it works. You have to feed off what the other person is saying, you can even introduce a subject yourself but feed off of what their response is in a positive way. It keeps the conversation flowing and the person will be at ease with you, because subconsciously you're displaying to them that you share things in common, which in turn will make them open up to you more.

Hope this helps, and I hope you manage to see for yourself how effective weaving is.

Racist comments are  spoken or written and those offended often take it to the wall to be heard. I am not considered politically correct in my use of the English language at times but I also tell others that I was raised in the sticks many decades ago and taught to call it as I see it. Ingrained responses sometimes come about and if they offend just consider me ignorant. Reaction to what you consider racist is up to you. Consider the source and move away or confront the source and be prepared to defend your beliefs. Just remember if you have come to America be prepared to run into people who will be racist or act racist to prove a point. This type of actions goes back several hundred years so it won't be cleaned up overnight or in decades to come.

Sure, the people who choose to follow the revised version might not always be winner, but some people don't care about winning all the time, they care about making this world and themselves a little bit less painful.

soc_1635633,socialskills,reddit_comment,357,"""only a small percentage will understand what i'm saying"" no, a very very large percentage completely understand. people do think about this stuff just like you. philosophy is human nature. that's why we have a billion religions. we wonder about our existence, our creation, our minds, we wonder about wondering and how it's all possible. we've done this for thousands and thousands of years. even formal logic has been around for a long long time and people use it in their everyday lives all the time. 

i used to feel like you when i was in middle school, beginning of high school. like i was special and not many other people thought about the things i did, or thought about them as rationally as i did. let me tell you it's not true. i have had very few truly original thoughts in my entire life, and the same goes for you i'm sure. but that's not a bad thing. everyone is different, but everyone is the same. 

it might seem like you're the minority because most people know that philosophical discussion isn't appropriate in all situations. in fact it's appropriate in relatively few situations. maybe when you're really close with someone and you share your every thought. maybe when you're in a real philosophical debate or a philosophy class. but not when you're exchanging pleasantries with your coworkers. it's not that people aren't thinking like you, it's that they aren't sharing those thoughts with you. it's hard to get that out of people, but it's definitely there.

do you remember ""discovering"" that you existed when you were little? realizing for the first time that you are a person just like everyone else? that other people are existing separately? that you are conscious? you probably thought, like most little kids, that this was a huge revelation and probably no one else was thinking about this stuff. but everyone was... we are all aware that we're conscious by the time we're 5 (at the latest), yet no one taught us that. it's natural. you weren't unique then, you aren't unique now. you are special, but so is everyone else."
soc_280750,socialskills,reddit_comment,133,"It's not an easy case, but you have to decide how much you're willing to go through with this guy. If you want to have him as a close friend, or at the very least have him more cooperative, then I think some well-spent or fun moments outside work would help getting him to open up more. From there just gradually ease into the subject that you want him to talk about. If the guy is bad at confrontation there's no other way to get what's really on his mind.

The other choice would be to just shun him for what the collective thinks about him, and just not care about all the things you mentioned. But obviously you do care if you went to the trouble of posting it here for advice. "
soc_526020,socialskills,reddit_comment,255,"when i had low self esteem yeah. i would have lots of self doubts, regrets and the disability to make a decision and stick with it. if you have anxiety, self esteem or boundary issues, you most likely have a comfort zone that is fear, fear about how others look at you, think about you or what they’re talking about you behind your back. you probably need to love yourself a whole lot more and listen to your gut. know that people’s opinions about you is none of your business, and they have no right to dish out judgements whatsoever. because only you know yourself best and you’re accountable to yourself. its only when you start doing that that you’re able to focus on yourself and your own wants and needs.

i dont have super close friends or BFF if thats what you mean. i think its not healthy to do everything together, even for spouses or romantic partners. you’re all individual people who need to live individual lives and have spaces. nobody can also cater to your needs 100% so you need to be your own best friend first.

i also suggest living in the moment for anxious people. we tend to have lots of fear, obssessive and uncontrollable thoughts like past memories or worry for the future, all dont serve any purpose because they’re not things you can control so they’re useless. so live in the moment and live your present well. it will really take a lot of stress off your shoulders."
soc_354951,socialskills,reddit_comment,536,"Hey there, so before I begin, I'm just gonna say that I know nothing about you, so I only have assumptions. This is really general and if I personally knew you I would obviously be able to give you much more personalized advice. Also, I'm just an internet stranger. 

So I had this same problem as well. For me, it took a lot of reflection and simply asking a close friend for an honest opinion. I pretty much learned that although I was a nice person, I really didn't have anything to offer to people. Coming to this realization really stung, but in reality it was true. The only reason I looked for friendship was to fulfill my needs. 

People are attracted to people who are pleasant. You may be confident, but if you don't care about other people or bring something to the table, it can be very hard to make friends. 

So what do you bring to the table? Is it a shared interest? A common hobby? Maybe you have a great sense of humor and you bring a positive vibe with you. 

I had to take a brutally honest look at how I treated people and if I brought anything positive to the table. For me, I was very stand-off-ish, very quiet, selective of who I wanted to open up to, only went out with people on my terms (this was huge), and generally didn't give a shit about what was going on inside of peoples heads unless we were very close to begin with. 

I'm going to use my sister as an example. She is a super sweet person but has a very hard time making friends. My other sister and I were talking about this. She is very introverted and needs her alone time to recharge. However, it is very difficult to hang out with her. I have tried very hard to make a connection with her, but whenever I try making plans, they are usually cancelled last second because she doesn't feel like going out any more, or she has a quiet evening inside already planned out.

 Eventually I gave up. My other sister is easy to make plans with. She'll go hang out just to see me, even if a nice evening inside is more ideal. My very introverted sister has a tough time making friends (similar to my issue) and it's easy to see looking outward, but she can't seem to figure out that if she sacrificed some of that alone time and spent it on other people, she would have much more meaningful relationships (to include her brother). Time is money, so if you invest a lot of that by yourself, friends aren't gonna grow inside your room. I know it's difficult to spend time on friends if you don't have any to begin with, but spend that time working towards it. 

Again, this is me, I don't know if this is you. I always thought it was because I was very introverted. I thought I was nice enough, but could never figure out why it was hard for me to build a relationship with people. 

Just my two cents, take it with a grain of salt. "
soc_1806708,socialskills,reddit_comment,206,"First impressions: how you look, how you carry yourself, the tonality in your voice. Where you look with your eyes, your mannerisms.

The amount or lack of makeup, and even your fingernails. *Edit:  Additionally how you smell as well, are you wearing deodorant or perfume. Do their smell profiles match each other, etc.*

Everything that I just listed is an outward sign of who you are because all of that is 100% controlled by you. It's your representation that you present to the world and it's what people can see and judge you on. We all do it no matter what we say, everybody makes an instantaneous judgment on everyone else the first second they see them.

soc_155398,socialskills,reddit_comment,335,"Take anything said here( in regards to my post) as a grain of salt. Ultimately it's up to you and what your feel comfortable doing.
My two cent:
A true friend wouldn't make you feel/ treat you like a dumbass( using your phrasing) and would listen to your valid complaints/ issues about these aspects, especially when it's clear he has over-stepped one of your boundaries. Your boundaries can be anything you feel someone has crossed. There is no discussion or debate about your feelings/boundaries. They are yours and there is no right or wrong about your feelings in this specific situation. Your feelings are telling you something is not ok and you want that to be respected.As they should be. 

However, this sounds like this friendship is all one-sided..and unless the other party is willing to listen and respect your boundaries,, there's really nothing more you can do if you are still willing to try to bring light to the issue and they want to maintain the status quo and down play your feelings and dismiss the issue by sweeping it under them rug by continuing to not care.

And if someone called me elitist/silly.. I would wink back at them  or roll eyes ( however you wanna play it)and say ""You know I am....Your not going to change me..Idk why  you even try"" and then walk away or do whatever it was you were doing...once he sees those words have no power over you.. he may stop using them to get arise out of you. Some people like seeing their words get a reaction so they can claim they are the reasonable objective one and the other person is just ""too sensitive"" or ""over-reacting"".

Again, I hope everything gets sorted but think about what you are willing to do for yourself if the situation does not change.

I hope you guys can work things out..it's hard to keep one's self respect in tact when the other party feels like they're attacking it.

But if you see this person at work every day it may seem odd.

I'd rather do it in person. If you want to act casual you could probably state, while chatting to them, that you feel like a coffee. Hey, would you like to join me? Then get chatting.

soc_1302023,socialskills,reddit_comment,341,"Does it look childish? Yea. Is that a bad thing? Depends.

If you're trying to find people with similar interests as you, shirts like this are great for that. But a lot of other people may think it's childish and weird and may avoid you for it. But consider this: are those people you would've wanted to meet or become friends with anyways?

Additionally, consider how it appears not only to your peers, but your professors and potential job connections as well. If your professor is quirky and loves Pokémon, that could instantly put you on their good side. But otherwise, it does look childish, and likely some adults won't take you seriously because of it.

But rather than worrying about what people will think, just do whatever you want to do. Present yourself however you want to present yourself. If you want to present yourself as quirky, then dress quirky. If you want to present yourself as mature, then dress mature. See, I have a social anxiety disorder, so I could never wear a shirt that's anime or video game related in any way, despite liking both. But if you don't have a clinical anxiety disorder like me, then for the love of God just be yourself. That's the best way to attract the right kind of people you like, and is honestly something I wish I could do.

And don't rush to get a gf. I get it, I'm in the same boat, wishing I was in a relationship. But if you make it a goal to get a gf asap, you're going to become desperate and rush into a relationship blindly, and that relationship could potentially be very toxic. Or maybe you change the way you act to impress a girl, but now you're in a relationship with someone who doesn't truly know the real you. Either way, finding a gf asap shouldn't be a *goal*. It can be a desire, but it shouldn't be something you go out of your way to do, if that makes sense."

It takes a great deal of fucking self-awareness to have pinpointed what’s triggering you and that shit needs to change.

But you’ve got to deal with the cold hard fucking truth, served up to you on a dick sized platter. 

Customer service isn’t for everyone, and it certainly isn’t for you so you’ve got two choices. 

The first choice, find a job in a more introverted environment where you aren’t face to face with shit stains all day. 

The second choice, accept that this is part of your job and roll with the punches.  

If you’ve been eating candy all your life and now you’re introducing Brussel sprouts into your diet, it’s going to be disgusting for the first three months.  But you keep eating it and eventually you’ll forget what candy tasted like.  That’s when you started getting used to Brussel sprouts. 

Your situation is the same. 

You’ve been fed mummy’s titty milk and toned down tantrums for the past few years.  Now you’re dealing with people who don’t give a flying fuck about what you think. 

If you stick it out, it will be bad for a little while longer, but eventually you would have heard every complaint, every tantrum, every fuck stain’s problems from here to south of the border.  By then you’ll be so bored out of your mind, you’ll wonder why you were ever upset.

She's already sounding pretty fragile and you guys are really close, so this could be a devastating and shitty way to part. 

It's up to you what you do ultimately, whether you keep being friends or not (although tbh Idk why you would not given that the only problem is that she's an anxious person), but you can put distance between the two of you without being so drastic and killing any chance of her ever contacting you again.

But I see this ending either sooner (if you decide to back off) or later, when she realizes you're not interested romantically.

If you want to let it play out and see if you might develop feelings for her, that's another story. Also there's nothing wrong with taking a wait and see approach, or just backing off a bit and see what happens. There's no huge downside to that.

soc_233663,socialskills,reddit_comment,434,"Here's the thing; you've got to get comfortable asking for a number, but you need to understand that simply asking a girl for her number means almost nothing to her. She gets asked for her number from dudes she doesn't know all the time. Maybe the most important thing when interacting with women is to see it from HER PERSPECTIVE. If some random girl you didn't know walked up to you and asked for your # completely bluntly and with no lead up, how would you feel?

Let me try to explain. When I was younger and terrified of approaching and flirting with women, I thought all I really needed to do was approach, ask for a number, then invite the girl out and show her how awesome I was and she'd be hooked on me. The problem here is that I did things in the wrong order. I could get all the numbers i ever wanted, but NONE of them would call me back. You've got to approach a girl first,  then show her how awesome you are and at this point she's HOPING you ask for her number. When you do, she's already excited about the potential date you're going to go on. As soon as I started really trying to be interested in the girls I was chatting up at a bar or party, I littreally had more girls calling me then I knew what to do with. I could pick and choose exactly which one I wanted to hang out, and if one of them wasn't a good fit, I didn't feel like I had to hang with her. 

So the question becomes, how do you show her youre awesome in the first few minutes?  Well hopefully you know that the answer is NOT to brag about yourself or try to logically convince her. In my experience, the easiest way to get a girl interested in you is to be interested in her.  You said you don't know her. Then why do you want her number? Introduce yur self to this girl and then GET TO KNOW HER. For all you know she's a total bitch and yall would have a terrible first date. You won't know til you find out. I would highly recommend the book ""the charisma myth"" by Olivia cobane. It explains how to master personal magnetism. I've used the book to greatly enhance my social interaction significantly. 

Tl;Dr it might be slightly weird unless you actually get to know her.  She won't freak out or make fun of you, but she probably won't call back either. "
soc_31615,socialskills,reddit_comment,168,"This can be argued both ways. It really depends on you and how poor your social skills are. If you're basically incapable of human interaction, this may help.

I recently wrote a paper for a pysch class on this specific topic so I could go back and forth on positives and negatives all day, but at the end of it, my personal opinion is that it completely depends on you. If you can meet people through Omegle and have casual conversations about any subject that comes up with low levels of anxiety, it may help. Try moving on to webcams so that you have more face-to-face time. Eventually, you should experiment with random people you encounter during the day: clerks, cashiers, etc. It may help you to think of it as an experiment and you're just testing out different methods."

What most conservatives (not insulting, but yeah, I am generalizing) have an issue with is they think PC means that they can't say what they want no matter how awful it is. PC is actually about saying the right things that will include everyone. I don't want to ever insult or alienate someone or cause discomfort to others by what I say. This is my choice, to not be an insensitive entitled jerk.

soc_17775,socialskills,reddit_comment,473,"I can tell you a bit about both sides:

I have a good friend with social anxiety issues. Having a FB really stressed her out because she often felt overwhelmed with it. If you have anxiety or are not tech savy, it's easy to feel like there's too much too keep up with because others post constantly, update at all hours, play games, post pictures, etc. If you are neither in the circle of friends to be a part of the update, cannot handle the volume of updates or feel social anxiety just by looking at the barrage of shit people upload to facebook by the second, it can be rather overwhelming. My friend, in this case, didn't even feel comfortable getting in touch with the people she did feel close too because she'd get stuck in the main page. Her therapist recommended she delete her page (in FB, you should know, you can't really delete your page. You can just deactivate it) and so she did. She's still working through her issues but she's more invested in face-to-face interactions rather than hiding behind a screen. In addition to this, she feels that the people she does get to see are interested in her more genuinely than the third cousin's husband of one of her old first grade bffs. 


It is really up to you if you want to engage in that adventure.


You could also do Google+ if you want to avoid the mess that FB can be. It's a little quieter but it's got some good features and anyone with a gmail account has one automatically so your friends still have the ability of contacting you and seeing you updating a page without it being FB. Of course, there is still a privacy risk, though I feel it's less aggressive than FB. Google wants to rule the world, for sure.


On the other hand, I use FB a lot. Primarily to network and keep in touch with long-distance peeps/family. It works for me because I don't get obsessed with updates of others (in fact, I liberally block people's updates from showing on my feed if I find them at all annoying), or with stalking people. If you want to go through the FB route, I suggest you have goals/limits already set up. For example, wanting to keep in touch with LD peeps is a good one. You won't know your limits until you try out FB but you should definitely feel free to block updates (those people won't know) or limit who sees what (again, they won't know), etc, to make sure that you create the social networking experience you want. Likewise, you can not add people you don't want to be friends with, etc. Remember that if you use FB you do have control over many aspects of your experience! "
soc_883976,socialskills,reddit_comment,439,"If you already have a good connection with her that suggests you're doing something right so maybe you're being unnecessarily hard on yourself and overthinking this. I don't think there's any need to bring these concerns up with her and it would probably do more harm than good, at least at this stage. 

For dates, in my experience if you like someone it makes little to no difference what you actually do with them as spending time together is what matters. My personal preference is to go to a bar early on. It's not a big commitment, it's informal, and I find a couple of drinks helpful when getting to know somebody new. As long as you use a common sense approach and don't pick something they will obviously hate that's not really something to worry about. Just look at the sort of things she normally does and choose something inline with that. 

As for what to talk about, that's just not something you can ever really plan in advance. I mean you could try but she could say one thing which takes the conversation in a totally different direction to what you had planned anyway. The best way is to sustain conversation is to be a good listener and be present in the moment, if you really pay attention to what people are saying you'll find that it's actually much easier to naturally find good responses then if you're too busy in your head worrying about what to say next. Some people say to keep the conversation light early on and avoid topics like religion and politics. Personally I don't agree with this, I'd rather just discuss anything that naturally comes up. I'd also rather find out what somebody thinks about the big things early on and know if there's any fundamental disagreement which may be too substantial to overcome. This is just my preference but really I think any subject is fine (with common sense exceptions).

I wouldn't really worry about the nature of the 'man's role' in a relationship, these roles are a lot less defined than they used to be. Just focus on enjoying your time with her and getting to know her and let your relationship naturally develop.

The only real solution to get more comfortable with face to face conversations again is practice. I'd suggest putting yourself out there as much as possible and look to make some friends, or at least just find opportunities to speak to people. This will teach you so much more and provide results much more quickly than you could get from any book or advice on Reddit."

soc_392211,socialskills,reddit_comment,102,"Kind of confused what you're looking for. Do you want to feel justified in not responding or do you want to know WHY you even need to respond? You already stated it's puts you at a disadvantage choosing not to acknowledge others and your choice stems more from perceived issues specific to you than what others are actually doing or thinking. So weighing the pros/cons of the situation, the choice should be easy. Obviously you don't have greet everyone (b/c not everyone deserves to be acknowledge ) but giving a small nod or hand wave is painless and would only benefit you.  "
soc_762728,socialskills,reddit_comment,323,"Yep. I'm 21 and i felt lile this a looong time. But ended up finding a bunch of great people.

Honestly the best tips i can give you are:

1. Be yourself, fully. Embrace your quirks and your differences. It might push some people away but it'll attract the real ones. The ones you can connect with.
2. Take time to think about your situation and make sure it isn't a self-fulfilling prophecy. I made friends when i got rid of this kind of romanticized idea that ""i'm not like other girls"". Suddenly, i was interested in people and what they had to say. Instead of focusing on what doesn't connect, try to find things that connect. Everbody has something to teach you. Find it. When i stopped thinking of myself as someone that can't peoperly socialize and that can't connect with others, as someone alien and ""too weird"", things started to shift.
3. Get in groups that share interests. Make some ads to set up a music group? Go to a book club? Join the student radio? Volunteer for a cause that is deer to your heart. Take some kind of group class. You'll find people that share interests and it'll be a great starting point.

Hope this helps! I remember when i was 19 i would cry every week because i was so damn lonely. I didn't have anyone and anytime i had any kind of social event, i would either be too stressed to go meet people or if i ended up going, i would come back crying because i just wasn't able to simply have an interesting conversation with other people.

There is hope... open yourself to others and others will open up to you. Embrace the alien in you instead of deeming yourself as unevitably alone because of it. Lots of people just crave to see real people not afraid to show their inner alien.

Good luck! 😊"
soc_639891,socialskills,reddit_comment,262,"My two cents, but there are two questions here. 1) Should you do something? Yes. 'Make a move' so to speak; ""Hey you're fun to be around, what do you say you and I go axe throwing next week?"" Start spending quality one-on-one time with her and see where things go from there, absolutely. 2) Should you confess? Unless you have a strong reason to believe she feels the same way, no. Picture another girl you've been friends with for two years (someone you're strictly platonic with). Picture her now coming up to you (while you have a crush on the girl in your post) out of the blue, pouring her heart out and saying ""Hey I've been into you since I've known you"". You'd probably freeze up, get uncomfortable, and look for the easiest way out. Easiest way to get out would be to reject her.

I'd suggest maybe waiting for any 'confession' until date 3 of you spending quality time on some activity (social dancing, bowling, amusement park, etc.). Timing is arbitrary, longer or shorter just feel it out, but give a solid test first to see if you actually like spending time with her (and give her some time to see if she likes spending time with you). If so then maybe more casually bring up a ""hey you're fun to be around, I kinda like you. What do you say we give this a shot?"" Everyone's different and one single answer won't work in all scenarios, but usually this works out much better for me than outright confession."
soc_225162,socialskills,reddit_comment,102,I wouldnt say your weird because I dont like too label people. You seem sort of anti-social maybe your shy. But there is at least one person out there for everyone. You could join a club with league of legends people to help you meet people. So don't worry if you're weird or not who am I or anyone in this world to tell you that. it's just words. Getting self-esteem and confidence is where it's at. You make the life you choose it's up to you to get better nobody can do it for you. And quit judging yourself. love yourself.

My biggest piece of advice I can give you is that you’re DEFINITELY overthinking it! I thought that there was a specific way to appeal to girls, but quickly learned that befriending them is just the same as befriending guys :)

If you’re into nasty humor, girls have the same humor, but it takes a little longer for them to warm up to you like that! Unlike guys, who will tend to make crude jokes right off the bat. That isn’t bad! Just something to keep in mind :) I hope you make lots and lots of friends in the near future!"

Slow or fast, up to you. If you wanna wake up tomorrow and never associate with these people again, fine. If you wanna cut them off one at a time, fine. Just Do it. Trust me your life will be better for it.

soc_172886,socialskills,reddit_comment,1257,"DIDN't expect for the post to be this long, however i tried to give you the most help i could. if anything else PM me and i'll help you as much as i can, although i am not a pro at social skills i hold my own some what :D

i can relate, with the ""how are people talking hours on end while i can't even hold a two minute convo!""

however i feel like i've solved that, well sort of....

what i did was Lower my expectations as to what i was *supposed* to be talking about compared to what actually we talk about. really there is never a standard as to what you should be talking about, you just talk, don't even question as to ""is this good enough convo?"" or ""i don't know what i am going to say/talk about when i am with XXX person!"" just don't even preplan scripts or nothing. i'll give you what worked for me!!!!


a while ago i was reading hella books on dating and shit,i still am a virgin but at least better social skills LOL, there was good shit.. mostly some weird mind positive bullcrap. but i can remember two effective concepts i learned from there. 

one- in a conversation there is something called rapport, which is basically the friendlyness of a person to another, basically little raport yields less talk, while more rapport yields more conversation. basically Rapport is how will the person be willing to open up to you, therefore predicting how the conversation will unfold and lenth of convo.

anyway there was a concept in which it talked about conversations. 

the concept of deep rapport vs. wide rapport--
think of it like this... deep rapport is very subject based. while wide rappor is basically really diverse. let me give you an analogy, deep rapport is like a sniping rifle, you are sniping a specific target or object, in the case of conversation is a specific subject, wether you be talking about clothes, finances, school, childhood memories,dogs, movies, etc is very specific. wide rapport is like a shotgun, you are firing multiple shots not just one, this could be like your daily youtube surfing experience where you start by watching a video about dogs, and next thing you are watching a video of a car exploding on a lake. however wide rapport in conversation is a variety of topics to talk about rather than one specific topic on deepRapor, think of the ""related videos"" on the analogy as how the conversation drifts, you started watching dog videos, but ended in exploding cars, but all due to related videos/convos that were ""related"" or somehow connected and therefore bled in together to link subject to subject in a conversation.

 So what does this help with fucking conversation and friends and shit you may think. well i'll give you an example.

deep raport. 

*you see a person walking with a dog* 

you say ""i like your dog, it looks so diciplined and friendly""

owner: ""oh yeah i got it last june... bla bla bla bla bla""

you: ""oh cool, i really like dogs, i remember when i was a kid i used to be so jelouse of people who had dogs....bla bla bla ""

owner: ""yeah you should adopt a dog at xxx shelter buy xxx food, buy xxx bla bla bla bla. 

notice how its always on topic of DOGS, a meaningless conversation but an engaging intresting conversation nontheless.

now wide raport

*you see a person walking with a dog* 

you: ""oh cool dog you have i like how its really friendly"" or some bullshit equivalent

owner: thanks, i really take care of my dog. 

You: how you got it?

them: oh i got it bla bla bla at the time i was in school. 

you: you reminded me of the time when i was in school, i used to do this shit with my notebook to piss of my classmates"" 

them; bla bla bla blal

notice how in wide raport you are drifting away from dogs and start to talk about school, and you can do this jumping from subject to subject back and forth referencing jokes, and building inside jokes, etc. this is valuable skill.

two- the thinking out loud
this is your conversation starter, usually you want to start convos with watever you are thinking on the spot, wether is a though of the person, their first impression, what they remind you of, stories you remember as you are talking. really it doesn't have to be ""THAT important"" or a subject to talk about it, you could even talk about cartoons, or watever the fuck, when you evesdrop on people's convo they seem kinda trivial cuz you are like ""why the fuck are they taking about this random ass shit"" but that is how convos work, there is really no criteria to what you should talk about or how long you should talk about anythying. you just have to go with the flow on this one. you just kinda have to share your memories and shit open up, and share your life/thoughts/experiences so that as in return people share theirs with you.


you seem like a kid still, probably highschool or college age kid. i know i was a social inept when i was that age and fucking around like a moron. 

One thing i do warn you about is as you learn social skills you start to uncover other shit. 

not only on the sidebar from learning about

body language, vocal tonality, how convos work. 

you'll start to uncover a bunch of shit like

fucking self esteem, trust me confidence might play such a big part on fucking convos in unbeliable, basically it test you, what you do when you run out of convo? and trust me is a lot, how do you manage other people when you are fucking up or being awkward? how will you manage yourself? how will people respond? do you even care what people think of you? are people ignoring you or am i being boring? ALL these questions i asked myself all the time when i would talk to people but don't sweat it, just keep at it.dam so many questions so many godam topics . using questions over statements, statements vs questions. cold reads, predictions, manipulation, influence/persuasion, compliance,lying, so much fucking shit, which is why there isn't a precise guide to learning socialskills, its mostly based on context, on people's personality, their boldness and self esteem and a bunch of other shit you don't even have control on that will unfold a convo one way or the other.


My recommendation is to build your self esteem, while at the same time learning social skills by talking to people more often. 

My recomendation is that, i get the impression that you don't even bother talking to people. is hard. 

but one of the main concepts you should learn one of the basic ones are even on the side bar BOOKS. Danel Wendler the author of Improve social Skills in a ted talk ""think of a conversation as if you were making a sandwich, where you put contribute and ingridient and the other person contributes an ingridient back and forth until you got a sandwhich"" basically you talk, they talk, you pay attention, ask questions,etc its all a engagement. 


also possible thread that might help you with conversations from other sub is /r/socialchallenge, read the read of week seven, and week nine really good concepts right there"
soc_1411608,socialskills,reddit_comment,105,"Yeah... I think there's a a category of people like that that you know they are toxic but you don't want to have to explain to them why you need to leave them. They will not understand you or accept your decision and seek revenge for your leaving.

Even though you had your friendships for years but realise recently just how toxic they are.

This includes mean girls who use fake friendship to spread gossip about you. And anything including emotions will be used against you.

People who spread gossip because they are bored

soc_105368,socialskills,reddit_comment,143,"People judge very quickly. It sounds to me like you have a strong handle on first impressions but missed your original opportunity to continue developing relationships. People *wanted* to know you better. They invited you to happy hours, lunches, etc. in the future, go. Let these be a priority. They are important for continued relationship development. As you declined over and over, people stopped asking you because they assume you aren't interest. Overcome the anxiety and just go.

As for your current situation, you're not in a fix, don't worry. Ask to tag along. Or invite them all to a happy hour of your choice.

Maybe first, decide what your objectives are. Do you want to feel more comfortable with small talk, regardless of environment? Would you like to develop the ability to approach a new person in a new setting? Do you want to reach a point where you know you'll blunder, but won't feel self-conscious about? What would you like to improve?

Second, what kind of practice are you going to do? Maybe read books on social engagement, reaching out to peers or coworkers, perhaps join a new club based on a hobby \[hint: find one :) \].

Third, once you've determined your objectives, how long do you think you'll need to get to that point? 3 months, 6 months, a year? How often do you want to check in with yourself? You going to keep a journal about it?

soc_382345,socialskills,reddit_comment,384,"When I have thoughts like this, I try to ask myself if I would even notice someone else doing the same thing. I also ask myself if I would care about what they're doing, or if I'd give benefit of the doubt and assume they're living their life the way that works best for them, and it's not my place to be concerned when I have a completely different set of experiences causing me to do different things. So then I figure, if anybody has the energy to both focus on what I'M doing, /plus/ let their ego tell them that I'm doing something wrong, I just figure fuck 'em. They've got other issues that are causing them to be so judgmental and it has nothing to do with me personally. I don't want to spend my limited time on earth holding myself back from doing absolutely anything and everything I want to do, just because there are people out there with anger &amp; selfishness issues. I also try to remind myself that I am a full-grown human with opinions that are just as valid as whatever random person on the street, so I shouldn't throw my own feelings under the bus to make room for someone else's. Plus you'd be surprised, sometimes peoples' thoughts don't align with the way they carry themselves. For instance, if someone is staring at you, it could very well be out of admiration or innocent interest. And don't tear yourself up for whatever you're doing or reading. People have no idea who you are or why you're doing what you're doing, and when they see you, most of them will just figure ""oh okay that's normal"". At least, that's what I do. Like, it justifies its own existence just by existing. At the end of the day, the worst thing that could really happen is someone coming up to you and making a rude or judgmental comment. But sometimes I almost wish someone would, cuz then I could pull out some nice comebacks like ""Do you want my autograph too, since you're so interested in my life?"" But yeah, drink some water, take some deep breaths, and go do whatever the fuck you wanna do, cuz that's what the rest of us are supposed to be doing too."
soc_198495,socialskills,reddit_comment,162,"If you want to change, you absolutely can. But, make sure you do if for yourself. IMO being outspoken does not mean you will have more friends.

As with anything, defining the problem well is the 1st step to solving it.
To be less quiet you need to first find out why you are quiet. Only you know the answer to this one. Think long and hard.

Note that ""I'm shy"" is not an acceptable answer. The question is why?
Maybe you are afraid of being judged, or maybe just overthink what to say, or maybe you underestimate the value you can bring to a conversation and end up not saying anything. 

All of these are different root causes to the same external symptom. 

Also, while you work on that, you can use a trick to make more friends now. 

Try finding and making friends with more extroverted people. They will talk more and will really appreciate you being a good listener. "
soc_570049,socialskills,reddit_comment,703,"                            
Maybe your quiet not because you think you are better than everyone and you are above them, but your mind plays a trick on yourself and keeps your insufficient and off putting personality from reaching others. Your mind may be protecting itself from reality while encouraging yourself that your doing the right thing. Figure it out, you might not be what you think you are and you may be lying to me in many ways. I wish I had a mirror. A mirror may be friends that hold you accountable. You are shy so you don’t talk to people that would otherwise tell you what’s right and wrong. But it may also be the case that my intuition is better than that of others. Am I right? Are my decisions in my best interest or am I just patting myself on my back believing everyone is against me? Am I confused or are others confused? Certainly not everyone is against you, but certainly a given number are. Others seek empowerment through throwing shade. Some are throwing light and you see it as shade and vice-versa. There is no way to know the difference unless;1: you ask the person who said so;2: You find yourself and determine if I have been lying to myself all along. You may be somehow damaging yourself to protect your ego. So how do I determine what the cause is well; Distinguishing between the two is a huge task to grasp and understand but through hardships, observance and self evaluation I believe you can get there. Please find yourself. Meet your self and take responsibility. Taking responsibility is not just acknowledging the fact that you have done something wrong. Everyone can do this, assuming they were conscience of the scenario. Really take responsibility. When it happens find the why and determine a plan. Go back to the drawing board and actually draw. Don’t just put the title up. What’s a blank paper with a title? What’s the point of pointing out an issue and doing nothing else with it? You can go as far back as you like to. Avoid distractions of daily life that pull you away from facing these realities. Drugs of all kinds life caffeine or even subtle addictions like dopamine gained from enjoying a tv show. How are daily addictions not drugs? They pull your mind away from pain and suffering. But maybe you’ll learn to do these “drugs” wisely. Not everything pleasurable in this world should be frowned upon, but the reason for doing them, whether it be a cover up or just for the hell of it should be understood. Just doing them without awareness is where you can find yourself slipping. Look at yourself fully as a guide to your personal success. Look at others for reference. No one is perfect, but these distractions will convince you otherwise. Why not just fuck up and acknowledge it and do nothing else while also filling yourself up with dopamine just to assure yourself you are on the right path. If you don’t want to be on that path you’ll need to suffer and evaluate. Don’t predict either the complexity of what’s to come. “It’ll be hard, it’ll be easy”, shut the fuck you haven’t done shit. Once you finish then you’ll know. No one knows or can tell you how to fix yourself you’ll just have to learn as you go. How often has an ideal path of learning actually been followed? Just attempt the learning process and adjust while in it. This doesn’t mean to not plan, you need to initiate before you can reevaluate your method, but you need a goal to even get that far. All in all it’s important to realize you may be 100% wrong in every single decision you have made, you may also be 100% right in these. But in the end it’s probably neither. Accept the fact you are not perfect. But don’t stop there and allow yourself to wallow in that muck, become who you want to be with the absolute ability of accrediting others and yourself for your success or failure. Be open minded in every scenario and try to understand your decision making."

There's many different kinds of meditations so it's worth exploring a bunch of them, I'm sure you'll find one most suited for you.

But more than meditation, what helped me a lot was simply reflecting on myself. Simply asking yourself who am i, why am i the way that i am, what do i want, and why do i want what i want. These questions will bring rise to more questions, and bring up thoughts that you might not have ever even conciously registered.

Again, I am sharing what worked for me, i genuinely believe that this is something everyone should at least try, but the beautiful thing about personal growth is that there are so many different ways to do it! Find the ones that work best for you! It's up to you to decide that through trial and error. It's scary just how deep you're own mind can go, but also super exciting!!!

Take it at your own pace and don't forget to give yourself a pat on the back. Just conciously looking for ways to better yourself and grow is already such a huge step!"

Firstly try to act easygoing like your mind isn't going 100 thoughts a second. Make a stupid joke that you know it's not the best but if you start that way a person you talk to will find it easier to have a conversation and be more at ease. I know it's stupid but I usually go for hi how's life, wife, kids even though they don't have a wife and a kid I get a small smile and depending on person we either countinue joking or the other person shares something. The most important rule in my opinion is do not ever ask how are you, that conversation is dead before it started. Secondly, try finding something relatable you both have in common. Everything from irritating teachers in high school(I mean everyone had at least one) to clothes and music. From experience that works the best. Even though we don't talk about smth I find very interesting it's still a conversation and not awkward silence. Thirdly, no pressure. Don't ask personal questions just accept information that the person shares and after time if you're patient he/she will open up to you."

I'm also pretty socially awkward. I wish talking was like texting, where you can really think about what you're going to say

Tip from a freshman in college who thinks back on highschool (if you want the tip).

Try putting yourself in uncomfortable situations. Join a new club or activity where you know a few or no people.  The more you get uncomfortable, the more comfortable you'll be being uncomfortable. (Does that make sense?)

Let yourself be awkward, learn from it and try to improve next time.  Good luck! And you'll find friends in college through sitting next to classmates!  Think of highschool as a test run since you'll never see anyone but friends from there again.  Also, it's up to you to keep in touch with friends just as much as them. 

I keep in touch with a friend who moved away as well as a few online friends.  Just a simple ""Hey, we have't talked in awhile! What's up?"" will suffice. Or simple ""Yo, we haven't hung out in awhile! Want to hang out today?"" will keep you guys in contact.

If they don't respond, don't beat yourself up.  They're busy, try again the bext day or so.

Basically, what I'm trying to say is don't be embarrassed about your resolution! Friends support each other, everyone is a little awkward in the social setting, but people figure it out by making mistakes and improving!

Good luck this year! Small accomplishments are still victories! :D"

Live your life the way you want it and not how they want it or how the world want it.

In the world of form, we are heavily bombarded with images that beauty is the only thing that matter, which is a big lie, its all business. If beautification has no money in it, everyone will be okay to be ugly.

Your mind should be stronger than your looks, all battle starts in the head.

Life has more to offer than to look good. Just be decent and nice and never try to hurt others because they hurt you. A lot of times, people will throw their trash on you, but don't see them as bad people, just realize that they are people heavily affected by materialization and social program.

soc_7193,socialskills,reddit_comment,1868,"I would take a lot of the advice in this thread with a grain of salt including mine. Aspergers is more complicated than some of the people this thread seem to realize. I guess the reason people don't realize what it means to have Asperger's is from your post because you seem to be relatively high functioning compared to some people with Asperger's I've read about or interacted with, and you're aware of the effects of your actions. You analyzing your own mannerisms might not be possible and just being confident and not giving a fuck is just bad advice from someone that doesn't understand Asperger's.


So I definitely think you should discuss these matters with your therapist or consider seeking a new one altogether. Heck, just print out the post you just wrote and show it to them and say ""I don't feel like I'm getting help with this here can we focus on this or can you recommend someone who can?""


I think we maybe looking into something with a behavioral psychology approach.


Wikipedia says on the Asperger page that there is therapy called social communication intervention which is a special type of speech therapy that focuses on I think what you're talking about.

Joining a Toastmasters speech giving group might also be a good accompaniment to this.  You'll never run out of material of what it's like living with Asperger's and you'll have an audience of people to give you feedback.


As far as your ability to make friends, it may be more that people just need time to hang out with you to see past your social awkwardness at first. So clubs and groups organizations that you have an interest in are probably a good idea for you. Sports or activities based organizations are probably a good idea, the social aspect is definitely still there, but if you can throw a frisbee a mile or you are a great rockclimber your social awkwardness is going to be less important.


As far as your fraternity friends. They probably mean well but don't really understand what it means to have Asperger's. Confidence/being relaxed will help but doesn't really get to the source of your issues. 


As far as being teased, that's just what having a a large group of male friends is like. People tease each other as a way of showing that they are part of the group that while you may have faults you're still one of us. Somewhat related to self-deprecating humor. I'd ask a close friend in the fraternity if this is what is going on when people are making fun of you. 

Everyone has boundaries for what they're comfortable joking about. Examples include, it's fine for you to make self-deprecating jokes about your Asperger's, and even for your friends to do it every once in a while, but a whole circle of friends making the same joke at once is crossing the line. It's totally acceptable to let people know that. ""Guys make fun of me for my giant nose all you want but take it easy on the asperger's.""


Asperger's is just an aspect of who you are it's not the only one. That doesn't mean that you should deny it completely either. Better to be honest, ""yeah guys I have Asperger's it can fucking suck sometimes and I can be awkward, doesn't mean I can't kick your ass at beerpong.""


Which leads me to the idea of whether or not you have weekly chapter meetings in your fraternity. Write up the speech and ask the president if you can present it at the chapter meeting. You should probably have friends look it over first. Of course you can say what you want, but I think the idea of it would be to let your fraternity know how you feel about having Asperger's, what's cool to make fun of what isn't, let them know that yeah you're to be awkward sometimes, but maybe they can help you be less awkward by letting you know occasionally when you're missing some social signals or what it is that you're doing specifically that is awkward.


You can consider adding a signal you can pick up on with your friends for when you're doing something awkward, such as them scratching their shoulder. This may be overwhelming but you can probably have them try to pick out one thing to work on for a while, maybe you're voice pitch is all over the place or you  maintain eye contact too long. Whatever works for you. If you're in a group of people and they signal you, you can talk about it later with them. Or maybe they can give you the signal that you're doing something awkward and then give you a nonverbal cue of what it is you need to fix.


Honestly not everyone in your fraternity is going be stoked about helping the new awkward guy be less awkward. But most will understand and some will be take an active interest in helping you hopefully.


Find out from the helpful ones what your social strengths are, whether you're funny, or you have interesting things to say about music, or some aspect of your Asperger's syndrome is particularly funny that you can play on and let strangers know you're aware of some of your awkward habits (sort of). Then play on these strengths.

As far as sorority girls... I mean I was in a Fraternity and hung out with sorority girls. But honestly a lot of them suck, some are really cool, but many will be too shallow to give you the time you deserve to get to know you especially when drunk at a party. But I virtually guarantee none of the girls think of themselves this way. 

Larry king says in awkward situations when you don't feel like talking to anyone but you know you should, it's best to just acknowledge that the situation is awkward. It breaks the ice and helps everyone relax. When you're introducing yourself to someone at a party ""hey I know I can be awkward and I sound retarded sometimes but I assure you I'm not... Well I am awkward"". sorry to put it that way I don't mean to be offensive but the idea is to disarm the person and hopefully get a laugh. Of course you can word it however you want though. 


FYI parties clearly aren't the most effective time for this but it's what you have to work with. Just try to do this before the party gets going, before there are other party distractions, and the girls have had a chance to analyze you from a distance and realize that you're awkward and decide they don't want you approaching them in the first place. (three second rule) So just figure out a way to come clean. And let them know why you're acting awkward is that you have Aspergers.  If you're awkward as you say people are going to figure out something is kind of weird anyways,  might as well let them know what it is. People generally are scared of what they don't understand , you're just helping them understand you. If this backfires does it make much of a difference if you go from that weird awkward guy to that weird awkward guy with Asperger's?


So find a nice friendly one not just someone you're attracted to, because attention whores and hot bitchy girls this probably won't work with and your goal isn't to get laid right away (not to say it won't), you want her to get to know you so they can vouch to other girls for you and maybe set you up.  Act as though you're looking for a sympathetic female ear, honestly that's all you really are doing. Let her know that you have Asperger's found that you know that you  can act awkward sometimes and miss social queues. That you're not some fucking weirdo, you know you're doing it but there's not much you can do about. But maybe she can. Let her know the last time you had a mixer with another sorority you  felt like the girls never really gave you a chance to get to know you. They were bunch of bitches and you were excited because you heard the sorority was really nice. Ask her if maybe she could help you out a little bit, have her let you know what you're doing that's awkward, and or be her little pet project for the night to help you make some lady friends. Play some drinking games together, have her introduce you to her other lady friends. I don't mean play the pity card, just try to get her to empathize with you, that you thought that she looked friendly and would see past your Asperger's (it's a social strategy of giving someone a reputation to live up to). Hopefully she will see past it. Ask her she's done anything as awkward as you have lately. Girls tend to have a sense of humor about their own awkwardness  as long as you're empathizing with them.


Beyond that just trying to be interesting, relaxed, friendly and  make sure you're well-dressed and groomed (more things to ask a girls opinion on by the way).


Just talking to people at parties is hard enough even when you don't have Asperger's is hard enough. So activities are your best ally, drinking games, dancing etc.


I wouldn't worry too much about sorority girls tho. I love some of them but, as a group they suck. Like really suck. House parties are where it is at anyways, people tend to not be such social animals and kind of resent that part of the Greek system. I had friends in an outside of the Greek system and I'm well aware of the pros and cons. The Greek system is a great way to meet people but there's also a lot of social drama and hierarchy that goes  along with it.

Also you kind of reminded me of this, 
http://charismaarts.com/

Wayne Elise ""juggler"" puts on conversation boot camps directed towards interacting with and attracting women specifically body language type stuff. I'd email him and explain your situation, if that is  something you might actually be interested in. He would know more if they could actually benefit.  I haven't taken it, but Wayne has a reputation as an honest no trickery approach to interacting with women within the ""seduction community."" if you don't know what the seduction community is look up the game by Neil Strauss.  The Seduction community Does help with the specifics if interactions and probably something worth looking into and could help you, but it is a pretty easy to get carried away with it. You might especially become too focused on all the little rules and guidelines and it could make things worse.  Just check it out.I don't follow that stuff anymore, I learned what I needed to and I got out before I got sucked in. 


Hope some of that helped if you have another questions just ask. I'd look into some behavior modification therapy and maybe run my ideas past your therapist. Best of luck."
soc_926881,socialskills,reddit_comment,276,"I’ll admit I was an introvert due to my upbringing and I still am in some respects.
There are moments when I enjoy being by myself and doing things by myself. Even working by myself because I am my most critical judge, so if something a group of us in work developed isn’t upto my normal standards, I will work late until I’m happy with what I’ve produced. That being said it’s never too late to start socialising more and being more confident around others. It only takes one thing to change you and for me it was the gym. I was always a bigger than normal guy but after hiding behind t-shirts on a summer holiday, I hit the gym hard for the rest of the year and by winter got myself down to a respectable weight and build. People were always commenting about how slim I had become and that became a conversation starter which then led on to other conversations about hobbies and interests. I can’t quite explain how but it just gave me confidence to talk to other people who I’d only just met moment before and be more social rather than sit down with my drink. Instead of being the one waiting on a conversation on social nights out, I was now starting them. That being said I don’t drink alcohol (by personal choice and something my friends are glad for during a stag trip to Oktoberfest!) so I’m still in control of my conversations and not at the other end of the introvert scale.

TL;DR Yes my upbringing made me an introvert but it’s never too late to switch over"
soc_252621,socialskills,reddit_comment,1104,"i think i used to be there with you. i can relate, although i am not the charimsmatic and good looking stud you claim to be, so i guess i didn't put ""high standards"" or felt ""entitled"" when rolling and learning. 


i think, back a bit, Don't rely on looks for friendships, looks are as useful as a fish is useful when you ride a bike. which means looks don't mean shit, can you find cool people that aren't good looking? hell yeah!, can you find intresting people that aren't good looking? hell yeah! can you also find people who are good looking that are fucking annoying? hell yeah. 

my point is looks don't really matter, and you shouldn't consider them the end all be all, sure it helps with people having an impression of you, and noticing you more. BUT they don't really help nor Not help you, its neutral, looks are genes and you didn't work for those genes they were given to you. 


OK, now, maybe i am being a bit harsh towards you by calling you entitled, but that is what i get from your post, ""hey i am good looking, and i am charismatic why am i not getting girls intrested?!"" 


HOLD UP, so you espect to have looks and have some social skills and say ""hey girls should be begging to jump on my cock!'




well, you have to stop thinking about looks, or attractiveness to judge people. 


i think this is the advice i read in ""improve your social skills"" (book recoms are on side bar try reading at least one). 


and its about empathy. basically it states to put yourself in people's shoes. now there is some fundamentals, all people are human, don't matter if its a man, woman, child, whatever eveyone is human, and has feelings, thoughts opinions, etc. regardless of looks, people will have their personality, and opinions, and it doesn't matter people, don't matter their looks. in fact, the most valuable advice i've gotten its been from people who are older than me and not very good looking, say if i was in your place i wouldn't of even engaged them in a conversation because, hey they aren't girls i want to fuck so why should i engage them right. 


thing is to be good at social skills, you have to talk to everyone, be that guy that talks to old, young, boys, girls, adults, engages them, and comes from a place of trying to really find the best in people, to be curious about their lifes, who knows maybe you will be hit by a story that is so impactful you will apply what that person learned for life, (this has happened to me) that is the beauty of social skills, to not limit yourself only for girls you want to rock with your dick, but to include everyone, that loner who is always sitting alone, be like 'what up yo!"", you never know how it will become part later on. 

find people valuable, not only the ""hot girls"" because of the obvious intrest of getting your dick wet.



but if you are, who you say you are, a hot stud with charisma but doesn't know how to carry a convo and it turns into an interviewer. well you noticed the problem fix that. 


to me it seems that you ask questions to know more about the person, but in doing so THEY aren't finding about anything about you!. so obviously they want to also be engaged intead of dragged. 



be the one that tells them a story. a funny experience, something you learned when you were at school that stuck with you for life (use this one people very likely will share also a story about their past that was impactful, soemthing that happened to you a bit ago, it doesn't matter as long as you are find it that you need to talk about something, well talk about that. 


The analogy, in the book ""improve your social skills"" it tell you that a conversation is like making a sandwitch with the other person. 

hey you put say (the bread) you tell them a story, 

then they put the mayo, they tell you a story, 

you listen while they talk, they'll listen while you talk. 


if you say ""hey i don't got stories to tell"", well my friend, that is where you are wrong, you've lived 24 years so far, there's gotta be something intresting, and if you don't feel like sharing, well easiest way is to do is to GO OUT, try new things like restaurants, clubs, activities hiking, shit like that, it doesn't even have to be social to talk about your hobbies, or the instance something intresting happened to you in context. 


i don't know man, i think you need to knock off the entitlement box you've climbed, ""hey i got looks! i should be getting laid!!!! why am i not getting laid!!!?"" 

no body owes you shit! not that ugly girl, not a hot girl, you want something you have to work for it, even if it requires you to start from fucking scratch and destroy the beliefs you had about yourself, about people, about the essense of social skills. 


fuck something as reading a nobel alone, could help you learn a lot about yourself, but you want quick answers, nothing comes at the prize of leaning back and browsing. if you really think you suck at social skills, well read a book! that book will give you more info and even better advice since it comes from someone reputable. you feel like your self esteem sucks, read ""the road less traveled"" by scott peck, the path is laid out, the resources right in your face, how do you want a quick fix to something that is being engrinded for years there.  


Open yourself up, open up, be willing to change beliefs and try new things, engage everyone, kids, adults, young and old, volunteer, do something instead of expecting, its all up to you, start from scratch, work on fundamentals and move foward. 


stop expecting, take responsibility for your shortcommings because at the end you are the only one who can control you, you are the only one who has the power to read, your motivation turns pages not the plot, stop the bitching and entitlement, work for it, take ownership and seek it till youget it. worlk on social skills, things you can control, then try them stop asking for pick up advice. 


do something other than pick up, and the pick up will do itself."

soc_1047860,socialskills,reddit_comment,148,"Thank you for that; I do want to befriend them, because like you said they’ll likely be around for the long run. They seem like nice people, and I’ve never gotten a “mean girl” vibe from them. The wives are girly girls and I’m not, but that’s been the case in all my friendships, I’ve always appreciated the balance it creates. The guys are loud and funny, and they’re inclusive/considerate of the wives. 

I want to be able to go to gatherings and feel comfortable and like a part of the group. But all my life when I’ve tried to be social I feel like it’s really obvious that I am faking it. Ive had genuine long lasting friendships in the past so I know I’m capable of it. I know how to be a friend, but I don’t know how to make friends if that makes sense?"
soc_971663,socialskills,reddit_comment,145,"I disagree. I think it depends on the person. I naturally have a pretty expressive face and its pretty useful to break the ice and keep the atmosphere from being too tense . At school rn I'm kinda the new girl and it's pretty difficult to make friends because of the masks: because of the fact that I have to cover half of my face , I can't show a lot of emotions and it makes it harder to communicate for me. I know this because when I was walking home with this girl who I talked to a bit we took off our masks for a couple of minutes (we did stay a bit far from each other when they were off) and I had a much easier time talking to her than I did at school. So yea , depends on the person"

But I have resorted to responding to him extra loud and asking him to repeat himself because the lack of confidence makes me increasingly uncomfortable.   I dont mean to be selfish, and I hate that I sometimes am not more ""supportive"" but... I guess my point is, don't worry if you're too loud.  Too loud is better than too quiet.  I've noticed when we are in a crowd and he is talking all quiet to me, people watch us as if we're ""talking trash"" or they just naturally are inclined to wonder why we are being all secretive.  Just my opinion: I doubt you're going to go from one extreme to another.  Use your voice, let it be heard, don't worry what others think of you, or your opinion.  Be proud with what you have to say."
soc_1659273,socialskills,reddit_comment,445,"Why is it fine for women to not be dating?

 First of all, in the traditional patriarchal/religious culture which is still influential in many parts of the world, a girl that has many sexual partners is seen as impure or as a slut. Also the woman chooses the man, not the other way around so if she's alone that simply means she hasn't chosen the one she likes yet. As a man it's the reverse, if you're alone that means you're the one that got rejected by all the girls, so when other girls know that, they assume that there was a good reason you got rejected before so they should reject you too.

Advice is this:

1) If you're a virgin at 23, never tell that to a woman, big mistake. Some people on the internet will tell you that you just ""find the right one"" that will "" love you as you are"". Don't listen to those people, it's a load of bullshit. There may be 1 woman out there somewhere that thinks a man being virgin at 23 is acceptable but you're more likely to kys before you find her because of all the mental strain from getting rejected constantly. The truth is that a vast majority of women would perceive a virgin man very negatively. So just say that you already dated before, but it was when you were a teenager and it didnt really workout so now after many years you're back to dating again. So much better and safer. 

2)Do NOT buy into the incel shit. I know it's very tempting for someone in your situation to try to blame it on women and convince yourself that it's the women's fault. That is false, women have every right to have high standards and the only way out is to reach those standards. Listening to incel youtubers will only get you further away from your goal.

3)Slow dating site usage to a minimum and instead spend that time to work on yourself. Forget about it for 6 months, a year. Spending hours swiping on Tinder will get you nowhere and only ruin what's left of your mental health. Instead try to solve your physical problems, financial problems and so on, and get back into dating once you've improved.

4) I'm not going to tell you to have confidence because once again that's the typical bullshit advice and let's be honest being virgin at 23 you're in deep shit but with hard work you can still make it. There's stories of people out there going on a first date in their 30s, which, while sad, is still vastly better then suicide."
soc_973188,socialskills,reddit_comment,391,"No matter what opinions you get from your post, just know without a doubt, if you truly love someone, LOVE someone, and you know the difference between infatuation and love, then you must tell them. Bc love can and will eat you from the inside out if it isn't released. You can hang onto it for a little while. But if you don't tell that person, whether it comes out in your favor or not, you will start to mentally suffer from it. You might not see it at first, but it will eventually break you down. Love has psychological, mental, &amp;  physical capabilities that no other emotion can even come close to in comparison. It can make you physically sick to your stomach and it has the power to make you happy and content. But it must be shared. And whether or not someone loves you back still isn't as important, (of course it helps) as getting it out of you. Off your chest. Get it out. It must come out. Love is a heavy weight and there's not enough room for it to stay inside you for too long. It wants out and it will start working on other emotions if it isn't released. I'm not going to tell you that everything will be ok between you and your friend once he realizes you really.... REALLY LOVE him, bc I have no clue. But I DO know that telling someone how you feel is very important to the mind, body, and soul, and that you did your part. Your mental well-being thanks you. And I thank you.. for being one more person in the small (but growing) percentage of humans that still believe that it's ok to express your feelings to someone bc in the end it WILL at least make them/yourself/both of you feel a little better about themselves somewhere in there.            But rejection is a whole other subject and I'm not going to combine the two in this. Just focus on the love. Get it out there. Spread it as much as possible. We ALL need it now, tomorrow, and especially before it's over. We are definitely not getting any younger and we could lose the chance in the blink of an eye. While our future is uncertain, today... we can control. Good luck to you.

soc_908916,socialskills,reddit_comment,321,"Hahahaha where I come from, I know many adults who don’t have sex until they get married, either due to religious belief or societal pressure. So I think these norms are perpetuated by the media, and varies depending on where you are from. So... yeah, I don’t think your statement is a fact.

I don’t blame you if you want to have sex. I’m on the same situation. It’s totally normal since we’re humans. But the difference is, I don’t feel it is necessary for me to have sex to be happy. If I’m horny, I go jerk off. Then I proceed to enjoy other activities (research, coding, anime, talking to my brothers).

Again, I think it’s just the difference on how we view our situation. I believe my situation (and prospect) is even more dire than yours in the sex department considering I’m 24M and Asian in USA. But it doesn’t bother me greatly (it’ll be a lie to say it doesn’t bother me at all). 

I believe the reason there are so many posts about guys being miserable and doubting themselves because they are virgins at 20s is because the media and society has convinced everyone that not having sex by that age makes you a loser. 

A living proof of a content virgin at 24 is right here. Do I want sex? Yeah. Am I unhappy without it? Nope. In fact, my life is great right now. So yeah, it is up to you what you want to do.

You can be unhappy because you haven’t had sex at 21, or you can be happy even though you haven’t had sex at 21. You can come up with a million reasons for why you’re unhappy because you’re a virgin. But to me, that’s just trying wallow in self-pity and it’s a process with negative feedback. Instead, you can find other reasons to be happy about in your life."
soc_310260,socialskills,reddit_comment,277,"It's always good to get out of your comfort zone so I applaud your decision. Most importantly concerning drinks, don't get too intoxicated. If there were time and means, I would have said test your limits on your own if you must. But since you are pressed for time, I suggest being bold and introducing yourself to a few groups when you enter the party in a casual way. Find another lone person who is not walking somewhere with determination or a more laid back person in a cluster. Just some people who you're the most comfortable reaching out to or look friendly. Make something up to start a conversation. You may have to do this throughout the night and sometimes feel like you're being rejected. If you find a group of people who you are connecting with and they seem nice (basically still don't trust random people completely though) then you can maybe drink a little more. If you are alone and don't find that group, maybe one or two beers at most but everyone's tolerance is different. Also make sure you only drink from a beer can that you open yourself. You have to be especially careful if you are alone. Ok enough with that now. But just put yourself out there and remember that you can always leave. Also, at parties, I feel like people are way looser and not so judgmental and closed off. They are also thinking about themselves even more than usual so maybe someone won't go out of their way to introduce themselves to you, but I think you can get a better reception from strangers than in real life.

soc_1695961,socialskills,reddit_comment,157,"Seems kinda obvious to me what's going.

First of all he's trying to impress you with how much he can lift. He probably suspects that he can lift you as well. If your weight is below what he can lift, then that should bring up the image in your mind of him lifting you, which, if there's any kind of potential for romance, he hopes will create a positive image in your mind.

Now, if you obviously weigh much more than what he said he could lift, he might just have made an offhand comment. He probably didn't mean it in a derogatory way.

If you *are* romantically interested in him, and you suspect he is into you as well. A good answer if you think he can lift you (but you still feel uncomfortable sharing your weight) is to simply reply with ""I'm not gonna tell you my weight, but you could probably lift me ;)"""
soc_501978,socialskills,reddit_comment,363,"This is a hard one to answer but I'll dive in anyway. 

I think it will depend on what kind of community you have with your friends on Facebook or on other social media.

I think it works differently for different people with different communities.

Because for example in my case, it works to keep all the friendships, relationships and contacts I've made (outside of FB) in one place, and it gives immediate access just in case I'm looking for them or wants to contact them because there are times I may lose their numbers too or their numbers change. 

Other than that, it helps to keep and maintain your social circles, your group of friends like friends from school, church, work, or event. You get to update each other or just engage with them and vice versa when you guys feel like it.

It's true that people get to be judged based on the external on social media. People tend to gravitate on what looks good, feels good or relatable. People tend to engage with posts that look better or sounds better based on what's written. 

But sometimes you just need to roll with it, to accept and adhere with the mechanic/system given just to keep the “benefits” of being part of it. I honestly don't like how social media like fb or ig requires poised-looking, picture-perfect photos just so people will accept/like/notice your post, because whatever you post is a lot more than the words and picture you put up there.

This only shows the deeper side of human, to gravitate on what looks good, seems good or relatable. 

Nevertheless, for me, it's still about keeping it all authentic, honest to your thought and emotions, and to your relationships with people, when you post, comment, react, share and do stuff up there. It's always a game of keeping it real with the real people in your lives over whatever other negativity there could be. To uphold and keep your long formed communities of friendships and relationships.

It's still up to you on what social platforms work better for you and the people you keep in your life. Have a good one! "
soc_181585,socialskills,reddit_comment,555,"&gt; I prefer not to mention where we are from

I understand.  I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable by pressing this point.  But I felt it was important, even in the context of interpersonal relationships (which I acknowledge you are emphasizing), to frame the situation in the larger cultural context.  We all share this modern society, which is for all practical purposes, global.  And if it isn't clear by now, I have serious issues with how identity politics is still such a problem for us as a whole.

I'm very sorry that you have experienced the kind of residual backlash and reactions due to your country's historic conduct.  I think those who've made you uncomfortable maybe momentarily forget that they are not just talking about an abstract event - that the person sitting right in front of them is being singled out by association with the unpleasantries being mentioned.

I must admit that the word vomit I banged out last night was somewhat reactionary.  In hindsight, flipping the tables on your friend in the way I suggested may not be a very nice thing to do depending on how you execute it.  In contrast, what you are doing, by trying to learn from the experience of others here, is one sure way to wisdom.

So in that vein, let me start again with my two cents.  I think the larger cultural context is still relevant.  One of the lessons that post-WWII Europe we should learn from is that reconciliation and healing is best done together.  The economic and social ties that formed as a result of the European Union brought together former enemies in a way that couldn't have turned out better.  Hardly anyone brings up residual anger between UK/France and Germany/Italy because of what happened more than 70 years ago.  Germany, in particular has been very self-conscious to the extent that they are very sensitive to anything that harkens back to the path that lead to Nazism.  Their law enforcement apparatus are highly attuned to anything resembling ultra-nationalism or neo-fascism.  One of the manifestations of this is also how careful they are to educate the young about the realities of history.  This is a huge reason why there is not much problems today.  Since Germany is a democracy, freedom of expression allows hate-groups to operate more or less openly.  But all sensible and educated people know better.

Without going into geopolitics too much more, I'll just end with the hopeful thought that things will get better as people deal with this more openly.  Regardless of where you are from or what your country of origin has done, the important thing is to make a brighter, less burdensome future for our children.  We should learn from the past if we can - all of us, but we should not wallow and trap ourselves there.  For you personally: despite how your friend makes you feel sometimes, do not feel obliged to bear the burdens of the past generation.  Since you've left your country and learned from others about how your country is perceived internationally, it can't really get any worse for you.  Put your time and energy into staying composed with dignity so that you can serve as an example and role model to the younger generation who will no doubt look up to you."
soc_1292964,socialskills,reddit_comment,232,"I'll play devil's advocate to some of the comments here. 

I think that moving to a new place only works if you have one person, at least ONE PERSON, that you know and can fall back on. You need a safety net of savings in case you end up hating it and need to bail out, and like others said it can be lonely and miserable at times.

I'm three months into moving to a different state and it is honestly the best time of my life! HOWEVER, my best friend already lived out here, there were months of saving and planning ahead of time, and I have a clear goal of what I want out of moving here. I had strong reasons to leave, things worth going to therapy over before I try and go back for any reason. 

Everyone is different, so take all advice with a grain of salt. For what it's worth, if you WANT it to work and you're willing to put in a lot of physical, mental, and emotional effort, it can be worth it. Just make sure you understand what you're getting into and have a plan B. 

Also, try staying in the place for a while before moving, and check out the areas outside of regular tourism. Get a realistic view of the place you want to go, not just the tourist honeymoon version."
soc_288271,socialskills,reddit_comment,137,"It sounds like you've been through a lot of shit in your life, and your parents no doubt played a role in forcing that shit down your throat. Dear, we can't live our lives in shit, that's what is the matter.

The good news is... we actually all have our own shit. I mean, humanity in general, we all got shit to put up with. There's probably shit in your life hidden so deep you don't even realize it's there until you flip the pillow over.

I'm not going to tell you therapy is in order, because that's a personal decision we should all make for ourselves. But I do read you when you ask what's wrong with you. It's not like I haven't asked that of myself, turns out I was wallowing in my family's shit."
soc_969845,socialskills,reddit_comment,149,"I'm really sorry to hear that!

In my personal experience, I overcame my issues with social anxiety by putting myself out there. We as humans tend to be scared of what is new to us, of what we don't know and aren't familiar with. As such, the less experienced you are socially, the scarier it seems. In the example of a job interview, our very first job interview was probably scarier than our 24th. 

So my advice is to put yourself out there. Don't think too much about how you come across. Another thing with social anxiety is that people are very self conscious of how they come across, of whether what they said was appropriate or funny/witty enough. Just say whatever feels right at the time.

The more you interact with people, the more you'll know what to expect from interactions. The more familiar a situation will be."
soc_1110096,socialskills,reddit_comment,218,"  I understand what you’re saying but I’m kinda confused on that last part. Personally, I never really had to deal with being accepted so I know my biased experience differs from many other people. I was always praised and recognized in life/school so I always sought validation from those older figures. I don’t do it as much now and I’ve grown to accept myself but it’s a work in progress called life. 


Nonetheless, what I’m trying to get to is that people will obviously have their own things in life that they are dealing with. People have hardships, traumatic experiences, good upbringings, good families, what ever it may be, it doesn’t really matter. What matters is understanding where they came from, what they’ve gone through, and who they are now in order to understand them. Not everyone wants to make friends or have someone new in their life and that’s perfectly fine. But, when you have the opportunity to talk to someone and get to know them, accept for who they are.It’s up to you if you want to continue developing the relationship or not, same goes to them. When you find people who do care and what to continue developing the relationship, you can challenge one another in constructive ways. 


I don’t know if this makes sense"
soc_925644,socialskills,reddit_comment,133,"Ok, it depends on your aim. My experience is the following; if you seek friends, just admit you dont have many, if you are new or whatever people are highly social living beings and mist likely will even be more likely to include you, of course if you don't bail out all the time and slightly contribute aswell!

However i would not suggest this with potential sexual or amorous partners, here rather pretend your good loving friends, and about whom you also care about... (Maybe dont over do it, so they dont break up once they find out :D)

Anyway i think honesty is always better. If you are a good lier, better use that skill to make up stories (like story telling) that are super fun and interesting to listen to ;)"
soc_113945,socialskills,reddit_comment,112,"Hard to say, but hey, if you're really asking this question...then you might already have the answer. My theory is for people like this is to do a ""soft invite"" and not expect for them to show. So a simple text or Facebook invite with no follow up. Just throw the idea out there. If she shows up the cool, if not then carry on. Let it be a pleasant surprise if she does show up. 

If she's legitimately busy it happens and might be a phase but if yall seem to drift and it's about a year, then just move on. Friends are seasons, they come and go. Just my opinion. "
soc_475327,socialskills,reddit_comment,284,"Random stuff, anything on your mind.

Why carrots are orange, how you saw a perv in the club, about how you forgot to lock your door. What you did today, what you want to do.

Talk to entertain yourself. Picturing it like this helps me alot.

Laughter in my opinion is the best medicine. So aim to make yourself laugh and happy. If your stuff is doing silly dancing, messing about with people and making them uncomfortable then do that.

You'll notice those people who've been friends for years and years they sometimes rarely speak to each other. Just because your best friends dosnt mean you have to talk every second of every day of every week.

You need to find the formula, the balance between talking about yourself and them. Do more stuff, experiment, be silly, because then you'll have funny stories and more opinions about things.

What I'm trying to say is there's no answer, no framework to learn. And if your worrying about what to say to people and what to talk bout then that already tells you enough.. your spending time on thinking about what to say to people when you should be just getting on with your life and making yourself happy.

Everyone is different. For instance another thing I notice works is when I don't focus too much on the conversation. That way if my mind is focused on a task rather than the person I give a natural response saying what I truly want to say instead of filtering and thinking and thinking again and thinking I can't say that because of this or this because of that or this because it's too suggestive of this, etc.

soc_1584081,socialskills,reddit_comment,178,"It's ok to not agree, but don't argue ad personam (telling me I sound like an incel or that I am jelaous or fun police). Arguing like that is meaningless. But hey, who am I kidding, I am on Reddit.

I didn't say that dancing in a club is as bad as shooting heroin. That's just you misinterpreting what I said to underline your opinion, but it just a fallacy. I just wanted to point out, that OP logic has some flaws and something which may make her feel good for now might not make her feel good sometime in the future. Maybe not, everyone is different, but I do not know many people who would be proud of things OP is talking about when she gets older.

On the other side, you come and call people arbitrarily fuckups and your argument is all about putting stickers on me.

If you wanna debate, stick to the merit and do not attack your opponent personally. But I guess this will be considered as fun police too in your eyes."
soc_832592,socialskills,reddit_comment,125,"Simply put - if a person speaks to you, and is outwardly expressive, they're adept, socially, and they are showing an interest in you. You shouldn't feel as if you are undesirable, or inept. Try to express the full range of emotion, as it is appropriate in social times. I would suggest that you don't build a bunch of barriers to put between you, and your peers, and that you should open your heart, and open your doors to new experiences with these people.

A person will show tells, maybe make physical contact, and will accept you for who you are. It's up to you to react to these things; try to remain pleasant in your interactions and everything else will, eventually, fall into place."
soc_704538,socialskills,reddit_comment,141,"It's sort of inappropriate due to the transactional nature of your relationship. i.e. If you invite her to something and she turns you down, then she has to worry about losing your business. It's awkward to put someone in that position. On the other hand if you know she has an interest in a particular type of thing (an event?) that you're attending, you could mention that you're going to it. See if she expresses any interest. Another idea would be that you're so pleased with her service you'd like to treat her to (coffee? lunch?) sometime and see if that interests her. That at least would be less awkward because it would be somewhat easier to turn down (too busy...etc.) if she isn't interested, without just flat out turning down an open invitation for no reason. Hope that makes sense!"
soc_1159434,socialskills,reddit_comment,238,"Maybe you experience the world in a way that makes you feel like other people dislike you, when in fact they're indifferent at best (but don't actively hate you). 

I find that people who struggle with their social skills (myself included) tend to have higher levels of anxiety as to how people perceive them. You may go out for coffee with someone you're not fully compatible with and freak out and think there's something wrong with you as a person, whereas the other may think ""eh, it wasn't the best outing I've had in my life, but I passed my time semi pleasantly"". You may also perceive people as extra hostile, when in fact they don't care as much as you think. 

You may also have an unrealistic idea as to how a friendships should be like. To have best friends you're super close with is super rare imo and with most people we're friends but don't spend our entire lives together and also we may not like every single aspect of their personality, but enough to hang out with them. 

Finally, I do think it's important not to come across as desperate for friendships. If you feel like an outsider and like people dislike you, you may give off this vibe and end up being marginalized because you feel that's how people will treat you, so you kinda come across as that yourself, if that makes sense?"
soc_1458245,socialskills,reddit_comment,159,"We naturally make associations with the things we see and hear. When they respond to the first question it’ll most likely make you think about something else. Just listen to what they say, and when they say something that reminds you of something else, you can talk about that. If they say they are from Minnesota, that might make you think of the time you visited a few years ago and you’ll likely remember a few specific memories. Feel free to mention one of them. Then from there, that comment could spark further conversation. Maybe you visited the zoo while you were there. Then you might ask if they like animals or have a favorite animal. Or maybe when they mention where they’re from, you could tell them where you’re from. Or ask if they enjoy Minnesota. There’s no right answer and everyone is different so just try to get comfortable being you and saying what comes to mind."

People nowadays think of you not liking somebody as an insult, when the truth is.. SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T CLICK. I'm not sure to what context you're friends with these people, but if it's more of a hanging out irl kinda thing and you're asked: ""Hey, wanna come to x?"" Ask who's going to be there and if the toxic friend is, just pass. Just don't ask if the toxic friend is going to be there specifically. If they ask why you're not coming just be upfront about it but don't make a big deal about it (*bad news travels fast afterall)*. Who knows, your other friends might feel exactly the same way but, like you, are afraid if they said anything they'd be seen as an asshole."

He should have been fully aware of how you interact with people socially before you got into a relationship. If he can’t love you at your worst, he definitely doesn’t deserve you at your best. 

I also think it’s stupid that he’s putting pressure on you to get better social skills. That’s the worst thing he could possibly do. I feel like it’s borderline emotional abuse to do that to you.

Just my opinion, but I think you have this preconceived notion that no one wants to talk to you, like your doing a disservice to them when you spark up conversation with them. You gotta train yourself out of that.

Workplaces are different since people are working, but at a coffee shop when people are there for leisure is when you should feel free to spark up conversation. If they get angry at you for opening up a friendly conversation or small talk, that's honestly on them and not you. To me, if you go into a public place and someone starts talking to you, its only respectful to return some type of answer. From there you should get a cue if they are open to it or not, whether they lift their eyes from their book or not. "

soc_500335,socialskills,reddit_comment,436,"I have a (semi) interesting case study for that actually; one of my housemates knows something about everything, literally any topic that's being spoken, he's there to white knight the conversation (whether invited or not) with the *real truth*. You're making a delicious home cooked meal? He's there to tell you that your grass fed beef isn't organic enough because it ate some GMO, and you should cut all the carbs out of your salad because carbs are bad, oh and always avoid non-organic vegetables, there's glyphosate on/in/eating them!

Now, this won't be wholly relevant to what you know about your own topics, but the key points are in how the actual interaction happens; one, he acts as if he's absolutely right, even when he's proven wrong by google (ooh, Big Google something something), and two, we're (he's) talking about stuff I don't care about. I know of only the one person who acts like the first point, and that's honestly only there so I can vent about how annoying he is.

The second is the important one: I couldn't care less about this topic, beef is beef.

The only way to really get around the ""know it all"" image (IMHO) is to find topics that both people actually care about listening to and talking about. Take computers for example, if my housemate knew anything correct about them (wifi gives us cancer!1!), then we'd probably have an awesome conversation, but because he's the one who always hijacks and derails conversations they never actually find an interesting topic.

I'm *not* saying you derail a conversation at all - but what you talk about may not necessarily be of interest to the other people you talk with, and they will simply chalk it up to you knowing a heap of stuff they don't care about.

So when you're trying to get to know a person, or talk with old friends, find topics that both of you know a bit about, and use that as the starting point for a conversation. It may turn out that you're both experts on AI, or maybe they'll be super interested in learning a bit about it, if they know nothing. Once you have the common ground as the starting point, the conversation will feel a lot more natural to both sides when everyone is interested, because nobody actually cares what the weather will be like tomorrow.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading my entirely unplanned half rant, half advice post!

TL;DR find topics you both/all are interested in, otherwise it may become a one-sided conversation, and people lose interest"
soc_166749,socialskills,reddit_comment,456,"Yes! And no; It's late and my story would be very long, so I'll be short and elaborate if necessary tomorrow.

 I have gained social skills and change people's image's of me, however I didn't ""repair"" my relationships out of a personal choice (my friendships from early high school were actually friends of my girlfriend and that was an unhealthy relationship so after about a year and a half I found better friends). I went to a very small and unique high school that people had to apply for, and it was one of the few things I was passionate about, so I eventually started helping with recruiting events - it didn't start great, but it was okay and that gave me lots of good experience where the only thing I had to improve on was my social skills. This helped me a lot because my lack of social skills came from overprotective parents who left me very sheltered and unsure of myself, by using these events to boost my confidence I was able to practice socializing, and the most important thing is practice.

Over four years I went from getting physically sick before/after social events and eventually became more confident and practiced in my social skills, I never became a super popular guy or had more than one person I called a friend(strict definition of friend, I had about 20 acquaintances and 30 more peers), but as of this week (I graduate on Friday, and Saturday YAY) I can go from social group to social group and interact with all the students, still don't always want to be social, but I can and it no longer bothers me. I even managed to have long talks with my all of my ex's who used to make me very uncomfortable.

My advice to you, identify traits you like in social people and want to show more of in you - I'm not saying to change yourself, we all have a humorous side, or a caring side, but we don't always practice showing these parts of ourselves or know how to. Try it, I always wished to be funnier, and to not be afraid to stand up for myself, so I started making more jokes in everyday conversation and slowly became more assertive- and it worked, most of the time people laughed or didn't question me and I felt good about it. And as of this year I've been much less of a pushover, the hardest person to accept that was my ex, of course, but for the first time I believe she respects me for me. 

**TL;DR:** We change our opinions all the time, and so will other people if they see ""a different side"" of you."
