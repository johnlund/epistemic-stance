Nobody is free from criticism. 

However, it is important to understand that a lot of assumptions we hold, or metrics we use to criticize someone are different because of different contexts and experiences.

For example, to a black person living in a violent area, the police may not be a ""protector"" but rather a ""military aggressor"". Our experience might teach us to run *towards* a Police Car when feeling unsafe, and their experience might tell them to run *away from* a Police Car when something is wrong.

Similarly, walking through a dark alleyway drunk might be a very different experience for a man and a woman.

It is also important to understand that a minority or a disadvantaged group may not have vocabulary or a reference point to explain their situation. This ends up in people dismissing their explanations or excessively scrutinizing their background or personal lives when they say something that upsets people.

A lot of minorities and disadvantaged groups are frustated and they might express their concerns poorly or through anger/aggression. A wrong type of expressing concern does not mean these concerns themselves are invalid."

That's the issue. Even feminists (myself included) agree that there are aggressive, unethical aspects and methods employed by certain individuals.

My views (counter-arguments to the video)

&gt;The media we call social is anything but

I use social media in two ways:

1. To meet new people. I've met people from different continents and countries through the internet, or just girls on OKC, met with a lot of them.
2. To arrange meeting old friends. I ask my friends through social media what they want to eet tonight so I can go shop for groceries and cook for them. Almost everyday. That's anything but asocial ! 

&gt;A lot of rhymes with absolutely no content

Not even gonna do any effort here.

&gt;slaves to the technology we mastered.

Come on, really? When I walk into the trainstation my phone can tell because of the wifi network where I am. It then knows that the last 10 times I was here I took the train to destination X. It checks when the next train to destination X is and tells me ""15 more minutes to get to platform Y"" So I know I can go get a coffee and pay for it with a plastic card. That's just my life, what about people with advanced prosthetics, engineering bridges, medicine, ... I'm pretty sure the technology helps us move our boundaries in stead of enslaves us.

&gt; a world of selfpromotion

Why would you blame social media for this? It was like this even before Christ when some Roman dominus got a fancy new carriage and strawled throught the via. With bright white horses. I get that social media concentrates this more into one place, but how much this bothers you that people are ""better"" than you, really is more to blame to you than social media.

&gt;being alone isn't the problem (...) read a book or paint a picture, you're being productive

Why would arguing on reddit (like we're doing right now), or even playing a videogame be less productive or ""mind stimulating"" than reading a book. 

&gt;so when you are out in public and start to feel alone

I really love urban loneliness, that's why I love in the city. There are tons of people, but no-one knows me. I can smile to people and enjoy their company but I don't have to do smalltalk. Does that make me asocial? No, it just means I'm introverted.
When I feel like doing something more exciting (like this, or what the next step would be in a schoolproject or just read a movie review or whatever) I can just do it. 

&gt; When I was a child I was never home....

I don't like watching football. I love playing it but I don't enjoy watching it. One of the arguments my friend brought up was that when we watch football in a pub, I'm on my phone a lot. If I wouldn't have my phone I propably just wouldn't go and watch football. I enjoy talking to my friends but when they are watching the football match at a pub. Seriously, what is the difference? You are watching men play football on a big screen while I'm propably watching a cat on reddit on my small screen. When they get distracted form the football and start talking I join in. But am I really asocial because I watch a different screen than you do?

&gt; smart phones and dumb people

Very poetic but I don't think there's much truth in it.

&gt; a lot of romantic, melancholic crap that doesn't have anything to do with smartphones at all, but somehow they try to make you belief you can't find a partner and have kids when you use a smartphone?

&gt; we have a finite existence, a set number of days.

First, do we really? Maybe if we advance far enough we won't. Second, isn't that exactly why we should make sure we don't waste time on trivial things. I'm a CS student, I know that there is technology that makes it possible for you to walk out a grocery store, your phone detects this, everything in your cart gets scanned and your phone pays for it. Damn, that saves so much time (just a few years and you will shop like this, no doubt).

I don't think this is possible. Numbers are simply a descriptor we give to the physical world.

Likewise you can't point at the moon and prove it exists because you could hallucinating/dreaming etc...  These alternatives while unlikely, simply need to be possible in order to rob you of complete certainty.  

Rationality is about probability, not certainty. Therefore if someone makes a claim that ""pain is bad"" it simply depends on the moral assumptions they are making.  It isn't necessarily feelings base.  In the same way that 3+4=7 ultimately relies on our assumptions about math, so do our moral pronouncements.

Super Meat Boy is different from Binding of Issac. I'm having a hard time articulating what I mean by that. As in why play one game over another if both require the same exploits? That's not exactly what I mean. 

&gt;You're being disingenuous if you don't think that same description can be applied to every single aspect of a game. Beating bosses is simply playing ""who know how and when to press buttons and how to wiggle the stick"" the best.

&gt;That's true, but you're conflating two different goals here. A speedrunner's goal is to get from start to finish as quickly as possible, not to 100% the game.

I didn't mean that as they must fight all the bosses. In Dark Souls 2 there are several bosses and even entire sections that aren't necessary to beat the game. This is again my view that there is a need to also play the game rather than just beat it.

I think it is possible to argue otherwise (for some animals it is very easy to read their emotional state), but I won't argue that because I think the whole idea that consent would be necessary in these situations is completely inconsistent with how animals are treated by the vast majority of our population, including vegetarians.

Example 1(for the vegetarians, but applicable for everyone): Pet ownership. Do we get consent when we take a puppy from his parents? Do we get consent when we neuter them? If you assume that consent is essential in animal/human relationships, pet ownership itself becomes a kind of slavery or imprisonment. The owner provides food and housing, the pet is imprisoned and provides entertainment to the owner. Any argument you could run about this being justifiable without consent would frighteningly similar to arguments for why slavery in the U.S. was good for many of the slaves. Arguments that they ""seem happy,"" or ""they don't run away"" are meaningless when you have kidnapped an animal and brought it up to be dependent on you. I'm not saying pet ownership IS slavery; I'm saying that the only way it pet ownership can be justified is if you toss out the idea of needing consent for our interactions with animals.

Example 2(for the carnivores): The vast majority of human beings eat animals. If you are one of this majority, the idea that you would ask an animals consent for anything is laughable. You could argue that unnecessary cruelty is still wrong, but much beastiality clearly involves the pleasuring of the animal, not the torturing of it. And regardless, arguments against cruelty have nothing to do with ""consent.""

So that's my basic argument. Come on reddit, change my view!

Edit: Changed zoophillia to beastility since zoophillia does not necessarily involve actual sex with animals. 

Edit 2: Just to clarify, I think bestiality is both disgusting and morally wrong. I think that cruelty to animals is wrong. This CMV is not ""convince me that bestiality is wrong"" or ""convince me that bestiality hurts animals""; it is ""convince me that consent is a relevant concept when applied to animals.""

I think there are cases pro- and con-cancelling the program, but you are basing your judgment entirely on an analogy, the substance of which isn't at all clear.

For example, just to suggest some of the complications: there are at least three different versions you can give of ""why the Maginot line was a Very Bad Thing"".  One was that it only covered one section of the frontier, and it should have been extended to the Channel.  A second was that it committed the French strategically to defending a particular line, when they should have had a doctrine of maneuver.  A third was that, as a matter of budget priorities, the Maginot Line was the least effective asset, franc for franc, in the French arsenal. 

Each of these suggests a possible critique of the F-35 program, but a very specific critique.  And it's not clear that your details defend any version of the analogy.

By the way, with respect to your thoughts on the F-35 vs drones, you might enjoy Geschenkeron's *Economic Backwardness in Comparative Perspective.* The tl;dr version is that for all large society-level investments, the point at which fixed-costs investment in a new project begin, the point at which they begin to start paying off, and the point at which the benefits have justified the initial investment, are spaced out in time such that countries and regions tend to leapfrog each other technologically; for example, the cities with the first subways and highways were rich, forward-looking cities, but then when a second-generation of subway/highway technology and techniques became available (partly because of experimentation during the first generation!) these cities were already committed to old subways and couldn't justify replacing them yet.  

So the point is that *observing* that a project which has a large initial investment becomes out-of-date just a year after you start the initial investment, and becomes more and more out-of-date (relative to new projects) as time goes on proves nothing. If you canceled the F35 to start a new project, ... well, by the time that project got under way, it would be outdated too."

It helps us imagine the greatest risks to our society, how we can improve our chances, and what we should be sincerely worried about.

While humanity is - in general - experiencing a level of health, wealth, and stability that we really haven't experienced at any point in the past, this comes with its own set of problems. First off, we have never experienced the kind of population growth that we're experiencing today, and each person's lifestyle demands more resources from the earth than it ever has. So we have more people demanding more resources. That's the part where you start talking about food shortages as a result of population increase.

To be sure, food is going to be a serious consideration in the future. However, with genetically modified organisms and advanced farming techniques our agricultural surpluses are the highest they've ever been, which is why we can sustain 7 billion people and counting. It's also important to remember that these advances often grow exponentially. As the population increases and more people are given access to education, our ability to create larger and larger agricultural surpluses tends to increase as well, as we have more minds working on these problems. It works dialectically.

That said, the introduction of manmade climate change is going to be a new challenge. Previously fertile land will be made largely infertile. *However*, the growing periods in Northern regions are going to increase while this happens. Whether or not that will make up for the loss of agriculture in other regions isn't a certainty, but it's worth considering that climate change will affect different parts of the world differently. Nordic tundra areas might gain more farmland and freshwater. To be sure, freshwater will be an issue, with the rapid pace of technological advancement, more efficient means of cloud-seeding and desalination are not beyond our scope.

As for the mention of nuclear war, that threat is diminishing consistently. War is a very different thing nowadays, and there is much less of it than there has ever been in our history. As a military tactic, well-respected commanders like Colin Powell have said nuclear weapons aren't particularly useful. Furthermore, despite what we may see in the news, the world is a much more stable place today than it really ever has been. Now, humanity never had the ability to wipe itself out until 70 years ago, so we really can't tell what will happen. However, war is not something that occurs internationally so much as *intra-nationally* nowadays, and paramilitary groups are not likely to use nuclear weapons in their own cities.

A very important theory to consider here is called the ""21st century bottleneck."" This is essentially the idea that if society can hold it together through the 21st century, our population will stabilize at about 10 billion and stop increasing. That requires poor countries to continue getting richer, however, as populations tend to stabilize as people get richer. However, looking at economic growth worldwide you'll see that the fastest growing economies are, in fact, in the Global South. We are curing diseases, providing education, and improving agricultural techniques which allow a middle class to grow in these poorer countries. As Bill Gates continues to point out, things are actually going very well in poor countries, which is going to help global stability in the long run. 

Right now, we're relying on the development of new technology to face the challenges posed by our current lifestyles. That may not be a bad idea, as the other option is to simply revert to a population and lifestyle that isn't conducive to an advanced society. We can't simply stop using fossil fuels tomorrow or else our society will fall apart completely, so the hope is that we'll be able to develop advanced forms of energy, as well as techniques to help us cope with the environmental changes that will occur as a result. If nothing else, humanity is adaptable. If we can just get by the 21st century, things really should stabilize.

All in all, I think the better statement would be to say ""human society as we know it may not make it through the next hundred years,"" rather than the arbitrary 500 year mark. If we do make it past the 21st century bottleneck things are going to start looking up, mainly because of our immense rate of technological development based on increased population, access to education, and the exponential growth of technology. Remember it was only about 200 years ago that infant mortality rate in the *richest* countries was worse than it is in the *poorest* countries today. If these trends continue, we will develop new advances in health, agriculture, energy, and resource development that we need to really thrive.

After that, it comes down to exploring and colonizing space, which is what many of our brightest minds are encouraging us to start thinking about now. The best way to assure the continued survival of the human race is to start moving off the earth, so that we needn't rely on only one planet. Sadly, I don't imagine that will be something that you or I will ever witness in our lifetimes, but there's a good chance our descendants will benefit from the resources found outside of earth.

tl;dr I'm actually pretty optimistic. Technology and global trade are growing faster than we've ever seen, and that's only going to help make things better.

EDIT: I've ignored things like a meteor impact because they're essentially impossible to predict. That said, with increased technology we can track space debris like never before, and that will help us should the need arise to avert a meteor."

- In the case of the Feminist movement, activists should work to make society aware of problems and favor hard data to rhetoric (not that rhetoric isn't useful)

- You're better served by telling someone why they're wrong than by berating them

- Criticize the action rather than the person. For example: tell someone that what they did was racist, not that they're racist and they should feel ashamed (even if they are)

- Equality not only means being able to achieve the same result as another person, but being able to achieve it with the same ease/difficulty

Opposing belief:

- Equality for any oppressed group can only be achieved by empowerment of the oppressed group, enabling them to go their own way

- Gains need to be won without any connection with the oppressor, because they're not going to help. If they were, they wouldn't be oppressors

- Feminist activists should take what's rightfully theirs instead of waiting for it to be handed over to them

- You're better off berating someone who practices intolerance to express the seriousness of what they've done

- Criticizing an intolerant person's character might make them reconsider their positions

- Activists have been trying to educate for a long time, and the hate is still flowing

*TL;DR - What serves modern movements like the fights for women's and minority rights better: the approach of MLK or that of Malcolm X?*

All currency is a delusion') while making substantive distinctions between Bitcoin and conventional currency based on technical reasoning. They engage with potential counterarguments (addressing how someone might try to 'duplicate' Bitcoin) and provide detailed evidence-based explanations for their position rather than presenting it as absolute truth.,"[""Of course it's a delusion"", ""Ironically, the only thing that distinguishes"", ""So you might be nefarious and try to lie"", ""what you'd find is that"", ""In this way it is no different from any other currency"", ""So that's how security is maintained""]","Of course it's a delusion. All currency is a delusion. Ironically, the only thing that distinguishes Bitcoin from conventional currency is that it *can't* be duplicated. (It's extremely easy to duplicate conventional currency: both the government and organized crime do it all the time, but it would not be possible for them to do it with Bitcoin)

Bitcoin is fundamentally not really a currency. What it is is a protocol that forces a large number of strange and foreign (and mutually antagonistic) users to come to a concensus on a history. Bitcoin is a globally-maintained history of literally every single transaction that has ever happened. ""Joe gave Bill 1 bitcoin on Monday. Then Jane successfully mined 2 bitcoins later that afternoon. Then Jane gave 0.5 bitcoins to Joe the next morning"". Every transaction that has ever happened to anybody is part of this globally shared history that everybody agrees on.

So you might be nefarious and try to lie about what you think the history is. ""Oh I don't believe that Jane mined any bitcoins. I think Fred mined the bitcoins that day"". If you ever tried to get your bitcoin node to carry on believing that lie, what you'd find is that every other bitcoin node on the network would immediately begin ignoring you and you would no longer be part of the network. The *only* way to become part of the bitcoin network is to agree completely (and they use cryptographic primitives to enforce that you *actually* agree with *every* transaction that's part of the shared history) with every other node.

So that's how security is maintained. If you ever tried to ""duplicate"" a bitcoin (let's say by saying that someone paid you twice instead of once, or paid you twice the amount that they actually did) every other node would say ""lol"" to your node and you would find yourself in a position where it would be impossible to spend any of your bitcoins until you conformed to the actual history.

So it's a collective delusion. The only reason bitcoins have any worth is because you're forced to prove that you believe the shared history about them having worth. In this way it is no different from any other currency."

The report concludes that ""The decision to use pepper spray was not supported by objective evidence and was not authorized by policy"" as well as ""The pepper spray used, the MK- 9, First Aerosol Projector, Was not an authorized weapon for use by the UCDPD""* (these are the titles of parts C and D respectively in section 2 of the report). Those two failings are probably the most directly relevant among a host of other failings during the decision making process at all levels. The report linked above also has the Kroll report attached which is a fact-finding report commissioned from Kroll &amp; Associates, a company that is headed by William Bratton (a former LA Police Chief) and staffed by retired police officers. This report also faulted Officer Pikes decision as part of a wider condemnation of all parties involved in the process leading up to the use of pepper spray on the protestors. The kroll report is lengthy but of particular relevance is section 7.2 (page 117 onwards) which analyses the decision to use pepper spray and concludes that he made the wrong decision.

*Edit - From the Kroll report concerning the MK-9 (page 155 of the total report, page 119 of the Kroll report, page 152 of the Reynoso report). 

""With respect to the pepper spray, the weapon used was a MK-9, First Defense Aerosol Projector. This item is different than the MK-4 product that is generally carried by individual officers.

&gt;And if we've silently agreed that those types of photos are okay, why aren't these?

In my mind, the crowd that justifies the viewing of the recent leaked photos is the same crowd that does not worry or care about photos of women posted without their consent. I think the comparison between these two things is fair, but where we differ is that I don't believe we've decided as a society that we don't care about photos posted without consent, celeb or no.

As with many issues, society as a whole tends to notice what's going on when it pertains to the famous. This is an unfortunate consequence of how we are wired, and while it would be ideal to tone down the rather destructive celebrity worship culture we've built, it's an entirely different beast. When I read about these leaks, I see the greater society becoming aware of an issue that has existed for quite some time in the peripheral. This happens all the time - Michael J. Fox with Parkinson's, Mel Gibson's racist tirades, even celebrities engaging in the ALS challenge. When famous people bring an issue to light, it's not coming out of nowhere - it already existed and now we're paying attention.

But anyway, to your main point. I really want to say this without sounding preachy, but the reason that viewing the recent leaked photos is invasion of privacy has more to do with the overall effect than the individual. What I mean is, there may be nothing lawfully wrong with what you're doing, but you're encouraging the act of leaking these types of things. On the internet, pageviews matter. It reinforces the concept of internet infamy, and rewards the behavior indirectly. You personally viewing the photos is a drop in the ocean. In the same vein, you personally dropping a candy wrapper on the ground is an infinitesimally small contribution to pollution, but you know that you are still contributing. 

Combine this with the knowledge that the release of the photos was done without permission, and I think you have a compelling reason not to partake in the viewing. It may not be ""invasion of privacy"" in the same way that the person who leaked the photos did so directly, but it is an indirect invasion of privacy in its encouragement and reward of those leaks. Cumulatively, the damage is magnified."
t3_2k49mm_t1_clhusz2,t3_2k49mm,delta_response,1.0,276,evaluativist,high,high,substantive,"The response demonstrates evaluativist reasoning by systematically analyzing why mocking/correcting doesn't work, using evidence-based arguments about cognitive load during speaking and practical consequences for conversation flow. The writer engages substantively with the OP's position by explaining the psychological and practical mechanisms behind why their approach fails, rather than simply asserting it's wrong.","[""Think of it from the point of view of"", ""When speaking, you need to"", ""Furthermore"", ""Writing is a better way"", ""If I don't want to fix the habit, I'll go talk to someone else""]","Continuous mocking does not guarantee that they'll write/speak with correct grammar.  You can mock until your mouth goes dry, but they'll make the same mistakes over and over.  

Think of it from the point of view of a person with bad English skills.  Speaking is especially tough because they don't have time to think, ""Is it he want or he wants?""  Next time, they'll want to say, ""Jeff say or Jeff says?""  

When speaking, you need to spit out the words quickly, otherwise, the atmosphere will get awkward.  You don't have time to wonder, ""Jeff is the subject, so the verb should have an s at the end.""  They just say it the way they've always said it, which is wrong.

Furthermore, with speaking at least, continuously correcting them really slows down the conversation.  If you keep correcting them, it will take a long time for them to convey their point, and nothing gets said because most of the conversation will be spent with you correcting them, and both sides will get frustrated.  Also, they might get so frustrated from talking to you that they won't want to talk to you again.  And vice versa could be true as well.

Writing is a better way to correct someone.  Correcting idioms and such are a good way to learn.  Same with using the wrong vocabulary word.

&gt;Speak like a idiot in public, and people will harass you about it until you fix the habit. 

If I don't want to fix the habit, I'll go talk to someone else because I don't want you harassing me.  If not, I'll purposely keep speaking like an idiot to irk you."
t3_2mv3n4_t3_2mv3n4,t3_2mv3n4,original_post,nan,326,evaluativist,high,medium,superficial,"The author presents their view as a reasoned observation ('It seems to me') based on evidence they've gathered, acknowledges complexity by distinguishing different types of rape scenarios, and explicitly invites challenge with 'So CMV.' They frame their position as tentative ('I am not saying if I think either reaction is right or wrong') and show awareness that their interpretation could be questioned.","[""It seems to me"", ""This is something I noticed"", ""I am not saying if I think either reaction is right or wrong"", ""but it seems to be that way"", ""So CMV""]","This is something I noticed after seeing the huge amount of discussion about rape on reddit. Now note specifically I am talking about the non-violent kind of rape where neither member is injured physically, but express verbal consent still wasn't given or statutory rape where one member is too young to give consent.

It seems to me that in today's society, men are expected to want sex all the time. It's most obvious in cases where female teachers have sex with younger boys and peoples reaction to it (mostly) is 'NOICCE' or 'I wish this happened to me, my teacher was hot'. Then when it happens with the sexes reversed the reaction is mostly, 'That disgusting pedo deserves to get anally raped in jail' and 'Oh that poor girl, a terrible thing has been done to her'.

As a result of this, you come across a lot of men who have been technically raped but who simply get over it extremely quickly despite feeling dirty, violated etc as other guys around them just say stuff like 'You got laid dude quit complaining'. Essentially, society acts to minimise those bad feelings, allowing the man to move on quickly.

However, when a woman gets raped, society's reaction amplifies these bad feelings to make the woman feel even worse. Society makes women feel they are now damaged, and a mark has been burned on them forever. This kind of thing is obvious in cases where a woman who initially thought a sexual encounter was just uncomfortable is now told she was raped. Society's general reaction to rape would only make the woman feel even worse about it, and not let her move on for a much longer time than for a man.

I am not saying if I think either reaction is right or wrong, but it seems to be that way. So CMV, does society make female rape victims feel worse about it then they would otherwise?

t3_22s6od_t1_cgpvjq6,t3_22s6od,delta_response,1.0,539,evaluativist,high,high,substantive,"The writer systematically evaluates multiple genre naming options (ASSFAGGOTS, ASSFAG, ARTS, MOBA) by analyzing their strengths and weaknesses rather than dismissing alternatives. They acknowledge trade-offs ('You're right that it's certainly vague') and use comparative reasoning ('ARTS would be better... But I don't think ARTS is necessarily the best term') while maintaining awareness that genre definitions involve judgment calls rather than absolute truths.","[""You're right that it's certainly vague"", ""But this is also true of plenty of genres"", ""I would never consider those games RPGs, though, because they fit better"", ""But I don't think ARTS is necessarily the best term"", ""ASSFAG would be better"", ""My preferred acronym is MOBA"", ""in my opinion"", ""So just like RPG is a vague term... so is ARTS""]","There's no need for the GOTS.  In fact, that's too restricting of a genre.

What if a Dota style game were to come out that had 3 fortresses/teams instead of the traditional two.  All the mechanics were otherwise very similar.  You clicked to get around, you had abilities and levels, an item store, multiple lanes and towers, etc. But there was 3 teams somehow.

According to ASSFAGGOTS, that would necessitate a new genre, since ASSFAGGOTS specifies that there are only two sides.  You would end up with all these genres that specify the number of teams they have, like ASSFAGGO3S and ASSFAGGOFS or ASSFAGGO4S, etc.


For that reason, ASSFAGGOTS is not the most fitting acryonym, because it's too restricting of the genre definition.

ASSFAG would be better.



And even then, I'm not sure I've ever heard of a genre being named after a particular game/map, either.  You claim that other acronyms like MOBA and ARTS are too vague, etc., but including Aeon of Strife in the acronym is meaningless to anyone who's never heard of it (which is probably like 75%+ of the people who play games in this genre).

So now we remove that, too, and we just have FAG left, which is just as vague as MOBA and ARTS, in my opinion.



Also, some more inconsistencies in your argument.  You justify RPG by its history, yet deny that ARTS has a history.  By your own preferred acronym of ASSFAGGOTS, you reference the origins of the genre.  Modified gameplay of a RTS.  But ARTS doesn't just share the history of an RTS, it shares many mechanics, too.

In most Dota style games, you use your cursor to move around, determine who you'll attack, etc.  You use an overhead, birds-eye style view.  The matches are one-offs, with any character progress restarting at the beginning of a round.  Metagame is immensely important, whether it's build order or when to attack.

So just like RPG is a vague term defining a genre with a lot in common with its predecessor, so is ARTS.



But I don't think ARTS is necessarily the best term, because it implies the genre is restricted only to RTS-style games.  This would exclude games like Monday Night Combat, which would be a real shame, in my opinion.



My preferred acronym is MOBA.  You're right that it's certainly vague.  MOBA seems like it could include something like WoW battlegrounds.  But this is also true of plenty of genres.  Look at how many FPSs have RPG-esque qualities to them.  I mean, CoD lets me unlock guns and abilities, customize everything, etc.  That sounds like D&amp;D to me.  Battlefield even has classes.  I would never consider those games RPGs, though, because they fit better into the FPS category.

Similarly, MOBA *could* include card games and all sorts of other things, but those games each fit into another category better.  So when you filter out those games into other categories, you should basically just be left with Dota style games in the genre of MOBA.  That also makes sure you're not excluding games that try to do something new with the genre, like Monday Night Combat.

I mean, action-adventure is a genre, so surely gamers aren't really that concerned with specificity. "

I've never gone to one myself (always find out about it a few days after it happens), but I'm planning on going to volunteer at next year's Boston parade, assuming I'm home from school in time.

I personally get a little uncomfortable when I see straight people partying hard at Pride parades. To me, the parades are supposed to celebrate marginalized social groups who are often shoved under wave after wave of oppression and hatred the other 364 days of the year and has this one day to fully let loose and celebrate in the face of a culture who still may not accept them in the way that they'd like. When straight people jump in, it almost feels like they're co-opting the one day in which non-straight people are finally in control. It seems to me to be similar to straight people putting a rainbow filter over their profile pictures - in theory, it might be OK, but in practice it shifts the attention from the LGBTQA+ people who deserve it onto the straight person who steps in. Almost like a ""Look at me, I'm celebrating pride! Look at how great I am!""

And, yeah, to a certain extent I think this display of solidarity is good. Gay/trans/queer rights won't move forward without the support of those already in power - straight people - and it's nice to see people united across gender and sexuality boundaries in order to celebrate how far we've come and prepare for how far we still have to go. That being said, though, I think there's a point at which a display of solidarity becomes less about the people for whom the solidarity is shown and more about the people who are ""showing"" the solidarity. I think that at a certain point, support for the LGBTQA+ community can transition into an exercise in self-promotion and narcissism, and I'm not super comfortable with that.

This is why I think that straight/cis people who participate in Pride parades should spend some of that participation on volunteering. The parades really run on volunteers, and if a straight/cis person spends time doing the thankless task of picking up trash, filling and lugging big containers of water everywhere, or making sure a first-aid tent is properly staffed, it helps show support for the LGBTQA+ community in a way that simply taking selfies with a shirtless parader will never be able to. I think it's a great way to be an ally to the community in a way that doesn't obnoxiously trumpet that allyship, and it might teach people more about what really makes the revelry run smoothly and give them a new appreciation for something many almost take for granted.

tl;dr Volunteering is a helpful form of allyship for straight/cis people in a way that just going to the parade and celebrating is not.

**EDIT:** Just a clarification - I believe that people shouldn't be *forced* to volunteer, and going to the parade at all is still preferable by far to not going. That said, I think that going and volunteering is far enough preferable to just going to participate that it should be pretty heavily suggested for people planning to go.

From our limited observations: One pulls energy away from a target, the other directs energy to a specific target. They manage to redirect energy much quicker and efficiently than we can, and without any technological tools, or at least that we can see.

How they do this is really just speculation, and without any experimental data we can not know for sure.

Synesthesia certainly exists, but I believe its importance has been overblown by people who want to be special snowflakes.

Everyone experiences synesthesia. I've never met anyone who, upon first learning of the phenomenon, didn't claim to have experienced it. I too have experienced it. It's a natural common experience, just like all the other shit our brains do on a daily basis.

Brains are all about making connections. Synesthesia is just our brains making connections between different sense memories. I would be more surprised if anyone claimed to experience all senses in their pure forms (i.e. without association to any other sense).

Some people give vivid descriptions of their synesthesic experiences, making them sound much more powerful than anything I've experienced. You might be tempted to say they have true synesthesia, like it's condition, whereas I have only experienced a mild form - comparable to the difference between being depressed and sad. I propose two alternate explanations. First, these people are probably attention whores. Second, if their descriptions are accurate then they probably result from some alternate condition like schizophrenia which enhances all their senses.

Some people talk about their synesthesia nonstop, even its most mundane forms. For instance, I knew a guy who told everyone what color they were to him; to me this is as bullshit as being told the color of my aura. Again, I think these people are just attention whores. It's like describing your dreams; we all have weird dreams that are meaningful and supernatural and fascinating to ourselves, but it's just your brain's white noise and it doesn't make you special. We should not entertain these people's narcissism, it's unhealthy.

So there you have it. I believe synesthesia is common and mundane, and the people who claim they have it are just trying to be unique. Change that view.

If what I said lastly seem like a bias to you, then be free to take it as a bias. Now;

First things you need to get is More =/= Better and Harder =/= Better. Other than majority of what you said being purely opinionated, a game being hard doesn't make it any better than it's non-hard version. Games like Dark Souls-Dynasty Warriors, Civilization and Europa Universalis, EVE and [insert any scifi mmo here] are examples. One of the main things in making a game is remembering that you are making a game, not a business simulation program. Things have to be fun, interesting and rewarding without being too hard, too complex. For the sake of the arguement, I prefer DS over DW, Civ over EU(Even though I play both a lot) and for the sake of the arguement Mechwarrior more than EVE.

A lot of mechanics in DotA that you feel makes DotA better are simply preferences. Saying that DotA champions are more is similar to saying a hamburger is better than a soup because it's more filled with different kinds of food rather than usually single food soup. It's simply preferences. 

Additionally, many things that you call ""harder"" and ""complex"" can easily be ""overly-hard"" and ""unneccesarily complex"" to another. Mechanics like denying, fortifying, elevation, turnrates might just feel uninteresting and cumbersome to some. Especially mechanics like your blink range being reduced if you try to blink outside of the range, which are just there to be paraded as ""look guys, our game is HAAAARD"". It's like Dark Souls 2, with making the game seem hard by putting around 20 generic mobs in one room, with a slightly different mob at the center and calling it a bossfight. It's hard without any proper reason, and pulling it off simply feels like you did something that should already be a standart mechanic itself, rather than feeling something rewarding, like pulling off a Zed pentakill or a full Invoker combo. Difficulty and layers of learning in your game has to be thaught in such a way that'll make player feel rewarded for pulling it off. 

The logic behind League's champion acquisition system is that in DotA, every single hero fills a special and niche role. Due to this, opponent can just pick a single hero like Broodmother that can only be countered by certain heroes without vehement usage of TP scrolls (This example of mine might be wrong since I haven't played Broodmother in quite a long while.). It feels defeating having enemy pick a hero that can only be countered by certain heroes, heroes that if DotA used League system you might not have. While in League, there are several roles, and in those roles there are several champions. Each role counters another role. A lategame scaling champion like Trynda, Riven and Jax can be countered by champions like Garen, Darius and Pantheon, with most of these champions being at any price range, with Garen requiring something like 3-4 games to get with IP while Darius can take up to 30-60 games. But it doesn't matter too much since all three of these champions share the same role and can counter a 4800 IP champion like Riven without requiring a very niche champion to counter her.

Saying DotA heroes are better than LoL heroes simply because they are turbocharged is purely opinionated and doesnt prove anything. It's like saying Superman is a better character than Caden Cotard from Synecdoche, or Griffith from Berserk. Sure, Superman blow them up easily, but that only matters to a child who cares about how fast Superman can fly. An adult will simply look at how these characters are written to determine which ones are better. One might simply find incredible moral gymastics of Griffith or incredible writing of Caden preferable to overpoweredness of Superman, while another person might find dilemma of Superman more interesting than straight up Satan Griffith and slow and at times hard to grasp Caden. 

League and DotA graphics are pretty much the same quality, only art style differs.

I feel like people don't deserve to have money in our society if they don't put forth anything that makes our society prosper. Just because you exist doesn't mean that you deserve the money that someone else earned through working more or working harder than you did. 

This currently exists to a much lesser extent with welfare, but that's unfortunately necessary because some people are trying to find a job or just can't support a family (which, if they knew that they wouldn't make enough money to support one anyways, then they shouldn't have had kids).

Instead of just giving people tax money, why don't we put money towards infrastructure that helps people make money through working? i.e. schools for education, factories for uneducated workers, etc.

Also, when the U.S is in $17 trillion in debt, I don't think the proper investment with our money is to just hand it to people. The people you give the money to will still not be skilled/educated enough to get a better job to help our economy. It would only make us go into more debt.

So CMV. I may be a little ignorant with my statements so please tell me if I'm wrong in anything that I just said.

When you try on clothes at a store, it's because that stores made the decision that you could. They can easily not allow it, and some stores or some products don't. For instance, you can't try on underwear at Walmart. And they place limits. You can't take those pants home. the owner of the property is allowing you to try it in specific and limited ways because they feel it helps them sell their product.

Some music or software companies do let you try their product. The majority of music producers put their wares on the radio so people can try it there. Many offer free tracks through various avenues. Many game developers offer demo versions. Again, the property owner decides how you use their product prior to purchasing it.

There are more balanced ways to go about it, I think. And in effect, doesn't that still prove the point, that it's just an overreaction to a string of bad relationship(s)?

Also, I'm not 100% on this, but I thought TRP was intended for everyman. This means including married men or men in long term relationships.

&gt; that's how i see TRP theory. by the way you mention your heritage, but you don't mention how or why it factors into your opinion. could you elaborate?

Soviet culture from the perspective of womens'/mens' rights are somewhat in line with TRP. Despite giving women a lot of the things that are currently sought after by feminists/womens' rights activists in the west via communism (equal employment, equal wages, protection from domestic violence, contraception, etc), the general culture has still remained very traditional in mens/womens roles (this can stem from an immediate deficit of men after the war). So this doesn't mean that women are a subclass to men in that society, but a kitchen is still seen as a women's place (or more accurately, not a man's place), women drivers are often criticized (often rightfully so, but men aren't in a similar situation) and abused frequently during the accident scams you often see on dashcams, it's okay for a woman to want a housewife role etc etc. If I am questioned about why I haven't settled down yet, I usually say something along the lines of how I haven't yet found someone someone smarter than me or who can teach me something new about the world. The usual response is that the man is supposed to be the teacher of the woman in a relationship (i.e. in matters she's naive in). You get the jist.

I'm assuming you're familiar with the tendencies in the west, where there is a war on how women get treated, men are stigmatized, the husband is always a stupid Neanderthal who buys a Porsche when he's 40 because he never lived out his sex fantasies of his 20s, rape is a big problem for both sexes, etc.

I fall somewhere in the middle of that tug of war, not really satisfied with either society's view on things, particularly because I've had fairly successful relationships in the past by staying away from both views. But the effect being from and often being in Soviet/post-Soviet society and not being happy with the man/woman relationship there is a similar dissatisfaction with TRP."
t3_1j00y5_t1_cb9tnv2,t3_1j00y5,delta_response,1.0,678,evaluativist,high,high,substantive,"The writer presents their argument as 'contention' from an 'economics standpoint' rather than absolute fact, acknowledges the legitimate opposing economic theory ('many economists believe as you do'), and systematically engages with counterarguments. They demonstrate evaluative thinking by weighing competing economic models and explaining why one interpretation is more compelling while maintaining analytical distance ('an economist knows').","[""My contention here is purely from an economics standpoint"", ""many economists believe as you do"", ""However, this does not account for"", ""Yes, there may be some businesses which can't afford"", ""but that is not as great a negative"", ""it would seem that market wage is likely above""]","My contention here is purely from an economics standpoint.  Sometimes, what's good the economy is bad for specific businesses, individuals, or politicians.  Keep this in mind.

This is a common debate in economics, The minimum-wage established by the supply and demand curve is referred to as ""market wage"".  Nobody disagrees that labor behaves as a good, and has the same supply and demand curve as any other good.  The debate comes because many economists believe as you do, that when an artificial price floor is imposed,  demand decreases, while supply doesn't change and therefore it leads to surplus labor (in this case defined as unemployment).  This makes the situation sound as though the amount of money being spent by businesses is the same no matter what the minimum wage may be, and therefore we're hiring fewer people for the same amount of money, for no reason.

However, this does not account for the fact that businesses hire to their point of necessity, regardless of cost.  The number of employee man-hours it takes to run a grocery store does not vary depending on what the employees are paid.  No business would lay-off the point of failure instead of increase labor costs in order to continue operating at peak efficiency.  By imposing a minimum wage, the business hires the same number of employees, but pays them more.  This means that more money changes hands from businesses to employees and while a business advocate would see this as unfair, an economist knows that whenever money changes hands, it's a good thing.

Yes, there may be some businesses which can't afford the pay employees minimum wage so they close, but that is not as great a negative to the economy as the higher wages of the remaining employees is a positive.  After all, the wages they earn usually get spent at businesses, so the business can pay their employees, so the employees can...and so on turning the gears of economics.

Lastly, it's to ensure low to no skill workers, such as teens or unskilled adults aren't subsidizing their meager earning with social assistance programs.  At 40 hours/week on minimum wage, most people do not qualify for social assistance programs such as food stamps, medicaid, housing assistance, or welfare.  This is intentional.  If the minimum wage were replaced with market wages, it would be possible to have fully employed individuals unable to even survive on their pay, and so they would have to resort to assistance programs which are supported entirely by taxes paid by those who are better employed.  So while I see the minimum wage defended mostly by liberals, the logic here is actually a conservative notion - The employee is providing full time labor to the business, so why have the wealthy business owner pay for half of his employees basic livelihood while the general public shoulders the rest of the burden?  The solution to that problem is to simply require the businesses to pay the full-time employees enough that the employee will not need public assistance.

To sum that up:

1. It yields a net gain in total money paid to workers, which directly stimulates the economy at large.

2. It helps mitigate the issue of ""working poor"" by keeping the fully employed living a lifestyle of survivable low-income instead of in poverty.  It also places the burden of funding this lifestyle improvement on the full-time employer directly instead of the general public.

3. If living on welfare becomes a better deal than being paid to work, people would trend towards reliance on welfare.  Because of the minimum wage there are fewer welfare benefits paid, and therefore it reduces the income tax burden on the rest of labor force by reducing tax money required for welfare programs.

If all that isn't enough, take some comfort that it's not as big an issue as it seems- less than 2% of people in the USA are paid minimum wage for their jurisdiction.  It would seem that market wage is likely above the present minimum wage in the vast majority of jobs."

Let's relive my first Waffle House experience. I've recently moved to a college town, my team just won a football game, and I go to the local WH downtown, and I'm starving. I order two chocolate chip waffles. Imagine my surprise when I get two geometrically patterned pancakes with chocolate chips on top. I was outraged.

Now you may be saying, hey, they're still waffles, just not waffles to your liking. Let us look at the Merriam-Webster waffle definition.

1waf·fle
\ˈwä-fəl, ˈwȯ-\
noun
:a crisp cake of batter baked in a waffle iron

Waffle House ""waffles"" fail to meet the crisp part of their definition. They are very thin, and only their checkered pattern distinguishes them from pancakes. Ladies and gentleman, a pattern of squares on baked batter does not a waffle make. True waffles are crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside, and at least double the height of a pancake. 

Either Waffle House needs to change the name of the ""waffles"" they serve or change the recipe because innocent people are deceived daily by this social injustice. Also, I would like to eat at Waffle House, but I am only disappointed when I think about how my waffle craving will only be teased and never satisfied.

Rain on a wedding day would be an example of situational irony because many women plan their weddings meticulously and have an expectation of control.  Morisette is accessing the culturally shared vision of the woman who has been planning a wedding since she was a little girl.  The rain shows what little control we actually have and exposes how our expectations do not meet reality.  

The guy who is in the plane crash says ""well isn't this nice"" (verbal irony).  Also he has a reasonable expectation that his plane would not crash because that is a very rare occurrence, and it is the first plane trip he ever went on, but it crashed creating a mismatch between expectation and reality (situational irony).  I suppose the man expected the plane to crash because of his fear of flying, so it is not ironic for him, but the characters around the man probably expected that he would end up somewhere safe.  

A traffic jam when you are already late is not very ironic I guess.  

10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife creates the image of a person going through a collection of flatware thinking that eventually there will be a knife.  the expectation that a huge collection of flatware would have more than just spoons seems reasonable, but that expectation is challenged by reality (situational irony).  

The free ride when you have already paid is also ironic because winning anything beats the expectation of not winning already expressed by the character's buying of one ride (situational irony).  

Meeting the man of your dreams accesses a shared and unrealistic (but nonetheless present) movie magic fantasy of falling in love.  This expectation is immediately crushed when you meet his beautiful wife.  This is cosmic or situational irony.  The idea that you are an important part of the universe and you have a fate or destiny that is significant is pervasive.  When the universe torpedoes that expected reality, you have cosmic irony.

The most common rebuttal I am familiar with is that her examples are more about bad timing or bad luck.  To that I say that there are many instances of bad timing or bad luck that create ironic situations.  Irony, timing, and luck are not mutually exclusive factors in any described event.

A less common rebuttal I hear is that I am seeing more than what is there.  According to this argument, irony must be tacky and cranked up to eleven.  I disagree.  Subtle irony is irony too.  Also literary analysis through describing imagery is acceptable in both prose and poetry.  I feel that Morissette was unfairly criticized because of her gender, age, and medium (pop music).

The final rebuttal I am familiar with is that Morissette agreed with many of these criticisms and defended herself by admitting that she did not understand irony that well.  Her admission needs to be taken into context.  It was made after many intellectuals tore her song a new one.  She was very smart to not double-down in the face of such criticism."

However, literature is a lot more than just silly stories written in a complicated way.  When I was in high school, I probably would have agreed with you.  English was the only compulsory subject in the last two years of school, and I was annoyed that I had to take it.  It ended up being my worst class by a long way.  Even today, I (and the few literature students/graduates I know) think that it's taught poorly in high schools.  English teachers absolutely have a habit of trying to find meaning where there isn't any.  If I can get technical for a minute, it's downright unparsimonious, and the sooner someone can figure out the literary equivalent of the Akaike Information Criterion, the better.

That being said, plenty of literature has meaning, and value in that meaning.  To plug some of my favourite books, *Catch-22* captures the sheer absurdity of war in a way that no documentary ever can.  A philosophy text can go into depth about the relationship between rationality and external power, but you'll never grok it as well as you would if you'd read *Nineteen Eighty-Four*.  No toxicology textbook will ever explain heroin addiction to you as well as *Trainspotting*.  These books aren't about nothing.  In a way, they're more real than history.  Good literature is about the underlying themes of human history, with all the noise stripped out.

And that's why it needs to be taught in high school.  Mathematics teaches you how to strip reality down to its fundamentals, and do away with all the mess.  Great literature does the same thing for the story of humanity, and boils it down the the essentials.  Learning how to do that, how to process the world, is the most important thing you can learn at school."

Or is talent born out of long hours of practice and experience?  If so you have to give it to Klein again.

What you see as a bunch of blue paintings may have taken hundreds of hours for him to achieve the exact shades he wanted using unconventional methods.

Fox News understands that news is a form of entertainment, and they have understood that from the beginning. They understand that *all* news is influenced by opinions and personality, and that simply going on air and reading the ""straight"" news off a teleprompter is deadly boring. Like, CSPAN-boring. Fox makes watching the news an entertaining experience, and **that is why they get the ratings**.

Fox's entire news production team is devoted to entertaining people and keeping them coming back for more. So they hire larger-than-life personalities (Glenn Beck, Bill O'Reilley, Ann Coulter, etc.). They mingle the news with opinions, because they know that everyone has opinions and is (secretly) interested in other people's opinions. Fox has always led the way in developing exciting graphics, innovative formats, hiring interesting talent, etc (not to mention great non-news programming on the channel).  

People don't watch Fox News because it's more informative. They watch because it's more entertaining. It also happens to be a right-leaning conservative news channel, but the exact same format and approach can work regardless of the politics behind the production. That's why you've seen CNN, MSNBC and other news programs begin to adopt a lot of Fox's approaches to broadcast news: engaging personalities, fluff stories, strong opinions, conflict, drama, scandal.  

Conservative newspapers pioneered this approach. The conservative New York Post -- the paper made famous for headlines like ""[Headless Body In Topless Bar](http://nypost.com/2010/02/22/83-killer-in-denial/)"" -- has understood that it's first job is to entertain for decades now. That's why they put so much effort into the scandal-sheet Page Six, and into dressing up the reporting with hype and personality.  

There's no question that Fox News's audience is the largest and probably most engaged. However there *is* some question exactly how well-informed that large, engaged group really is. [A Public Mind survey](http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/174826/survey-nprs-listeners-best-informed-fox-news-viewers-worst-informed/) found that exclusive Fox viewers scored dead last in a survey of knowledge about domestic news topics.

My first recommendation to you would be to quantify this. Go to lolking, or your summoner profile, or whatever, and figure out how many games you've actually played. Multiply this by the ""average game"" to calculate how much time you've actually spent playing these games. Be sure to compare this with the daily estimate you gave us above.

Think about your work and your free time. Think about any goals you may have, and how busy your daily schedule is. Then think about what you said near the end of your post:

Start thinking about how true these claims actually are. I've personally quit lol two different times, both times because the fun:time ratio was way too small. I found the game to be repetitive and predictable. I was frustrated that, often times, the game was decided before it was even half over. Since I wasn't willing to convert real money into virtual money, my progress was annoyingly slow, and the game became more of a hassle than anything else. I know how fun that game can be. I know the feeling of playing a brand new champ, having an excellent team fight, or playing online with several friends. Its great. The question is: how great? How often do awesome moments occur?

I add the rule that the trolley will not stop if it hits you, and will only stop if it hits the person with you, which eliminates the ""I'll jump myself"" answer and keeps the idea of the scenario in place.

I believe that the proper solution is to push the person off the bridge. The purpose of the problem is to present a dilemma between utilitarianism (benefitting the most people in the best way) and deontology (doing one's duty in life as in following basic principles), but I do not believe that doing nothing and allowing the 5 people to die is ethical under either mindset. By neglecting to push the other person off the bridge, you have prioritized your own moral standpoint over the lives of not just one, but 5 other people. The idea that one should not kill may be generally applicable, but to effectively condemn other people to die because you do not want to compromise your morals is incredibly selfish, and goes against the implied deontological principle that one should prioritize the needs of others over one's own (especially if one's needs are really wants).

To me they are not things that require some moral label like good/bad, etc... one's sexuality is their own business.

However, I can't notice that the people who really support gay marriage are really turning it into something it's not: an issue of ""rights"". People like to talk about innate human rights, but really, the notion of ""rights"" only makes sense from a legal perspective and thus, requires backing from the legal documentation of the country. AFAIK the Constitution doesn't explicitly support or condemn gay marriage - however, supporters of gay marriage frequently claim that not allowing it is ""violating rights"" and they even compare it to the Civil Rights movement of the 60s, which I find really shocking. The main difference is that for blacks, the systematic discrimination was impacting their ability to enjoy the right to life, liberty, etc... for instance, how can people work when the only factory in town won't hire them because of their skin? To me, stuff like segregation/slavery/etc. was a LOT bigger than the things proponents of ""gay rights"" complain about.

Here are things gay people have to worry about:

- Not being able to marry their same-sex partner. While this is a bummer for them, it's not their \*right* to get married. I know a lot of people say things like ""the gov't can't tell me who I can and can't love!"" which is a ridiculous Strawman of the issue. I've seen some couples that deeply love each other but are not married, and the reverse as well. Marriage != love. Marriage is a specifically-defined institution for the region in which it is considered legally relevant. So when people are getting gay marriage legalized, they're not giving gays more rights, they're just changing that state's definition of what a legal marriage is.

- The ""Christian cake-baker"" - there have been a number of cases where someone refuses to perform a service for a gay couple's wedding due to their religious beliefs. They don't ban gays from their store, and they don't pledge to never serve a gay. They just don't want to support a gay marriage. The thing is, people like this are in the extreme minority and most would prefer they couple's money. They can easily take their business elsewhere, so how is the couple really being harmed by this? I'd say it's more harmful to force the religious person to compromise their beliefs.

- Sodomy laws. I guess this is an ""issue"", but as far as I know this law is less enforced than the 55 MPH speed limit. Many states have officially repealed them, and I doubt anyone would actually get arrested for it. I'd say that this would in fact be a violation of rights as it concerns private, self-contained behavior - but the law is entirely archaic and unenforced.

To me, these things are definitely not on the level of what blacks fought for decades ago, and comparing the legalization of gay marriage to this is a disgrace to those noble fighters such as MLK, Rosa Parks, etc... the current ""gay movement"" isn't about gays getting made equal to straight people, it's just about gays getting what they want - which isn't bad mind you, it just isn't the same as fighting inequality."

Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I look forward to hearing another point of view.

My main points:

1.) Physically.  Men dominate sports and physical events.  I can't think of one sport that women are better than men at, in general, and if there are a few, that's only a few, and men dominate the rest. 

2.) In the work place.  This is the most controversial part.  Women want equal pay, but from what I've seen in my limited 8 years in industry, is that women are not as good as men at their jobs.  My industry is oil refining.  99% of the plant workers are men, why?  I work in the Engineering office.  There are no women engineers, only secretaries, and some of them baffle me at how incompetent they are. (Admittedly our one secretary is excellent at her job, and does far better than I ever could.  But my point here is that a man could do that job just as well.) 

3.) At home.  This is where most of my point lies.  It could just be a gender roles thing, but why am I so much better at everything than my girlfriend?  I'm not saying I'm great, but rather most of the girlfriends I've had are completely incompetent at a lot of things.  Things like building an Ikea cabinet, she can't do it.  Small, mundane challenges like un-stacking and re-stacking a sleeve of solo cups.  We had to do it as part of a challenge, and I was much faster at it.  She couldn't figure out how the gear shifters worked on a newer mountain bike after riding it for 10 minutes.  I had never seen this type before, but figured it out in 10 seconds.  Not because I'm clever, but because it is simple and something I believe should be easy for any adult to figure out. 

These reasons are why I hold this view.  I look forward to being completely flamed for this view, and also for another perspective.  Thanks.

A simplified version of this theory (because of the last item) is ""conservatives are motivated by disgust reactions"".

My point is, the problem is that Haidt's methodology is flawed because he assumed the same things will effect a disgust reaction in liberals and conservatives. It is not true. His questions are too much conservative focused e.g. desecrating a flag. Liberals are simply disgusted by different things, for example desecreating knowledge: burning books or libraries.

I think liberals feel more disgust over violence and blood for example. It is not simply a care/harm thing, I think perfectly voluntary violence like an MMA match with some blood will disgust liberals more than conservatives.

Similarly ask them about how they feel about shooting a dog who is in incurable pain and debilitating disability (and therefore it is a caring, not harmful act), liberals will feel more disgusted by it.

So if you balance your questions properly, you take into account different kinds of disgust, you don't find liberals are less motivated by disgust than conservatives.

Similarly, it is not that liberals are less likely to respect authority, but more like they respect different authorities: the police less, and scientists more.

In loyalty Haidt focuses too much on loyalty to your nation or family and not your political movement or social class. 

My view is that with properly balanced questionnaires that take into account that (US) liberals and conservatives are upset by different things, these differences would disappear. 

In other words that it is mostly useless.

I don't believe that it is the power that corrupts people, but the fact that people themselves are corrupt to begin with, and that obtaining a position of power just offers them a medium through which to act on their corruption. I do believe that the majority of people are, in fact, corrupt. So assuming you take a random person and insert them into a position of power, it is likely that they will abuse the power that is granted to them. But, I also believe if you take a person who isn't corrupt, and insert them into this same position of power, they will not abuse the privileges and power of the position that is granted to them.

I think teachers illustrate this point very well, especially because it is much easier to become a teacher than say, the President of the United States. In this regard, you tend to have a larger sample size and have many more types of people to consider. In most cases, I would say that teachers tend to have absolute power over their classes, at least with regards to day-to-day activities. (Generally, if a teacher says to do something, it is expected that the student comply to the demand of the teacher. If the student disagrees, typically the matter is resolved at a later date with the intervention of a teacher's superior.)

Taking this assumption that teachers have absolute power over their students, you still tend to find a balance of teachers who abuse their power, and those who don't. If the saying that ""absolute power corrupts absolutely"" were true, all teachers would abuse their power, since it is the power that corrupts the person, and not the person that corrupts the power.

Parents work well for this example as well. Literally anybody can become a parent, as having a child is as easy as having sex. I would even say that parents definitely have absolute power over their children, even moreso than teachers. But even with parenting, you still tend to find a balance. Some parents are incredibly strict and unfair, dictating arbitrary rules for their children that they themselves may not follow, or rules that have no legitimate reason other than ""because I say so."" (I'm not arguing the fact that sometimes parents use the ""because I say so"" justification even if the rule does have a legitimate reason, but sometimes parents don't actually have a reason other than ""I say so."") However, you also find parents that are incredibly fair with their children. If a child does not agree with a rule set by a parent, and argues his or her case fairly, there are parents that would reconsider and change their rule for the sake of being fair. If ""absolute power corrupts absolutely,"" parents like the latter would not exist, as the power they hold over their child would corrupt them.

TL;DR: CMV: Absolute power does not corrupt absolutely; absolute corruption corrupts power absolutely."
