I’ve gone through this with romantic partners and friendships. 

You said yourself she puts in effort with others and gives a blanket statement (I’m struggling) to diffuse blame. Guess what: We’re ALL struggling. What about your struggles? There’s no reciprocation. This is horribly anxiety inducing and hurtful. 

This also isn’t your fault. OP, it’s not up to you to put in the effort to rebuild a relationship that she let rot and decay. You tried to breathe life into it for ages, and it didn’t seem to work. You are much better off putting that effort into making new friends, finding a new hobby, binging a new TV show, or catching up on sleep than to continue putting effort into a relationship with her.

Its not really your moral code, but this is a moral code designed by a civilized society to keep people from being hurt and respecting their privacy and their life.

What I was talking about is your own moral code. Maybe the word ""moral code"" are not really a good words for this.

If you watched ""How I met your mother"", there was a ""Bro code"" made by Barney Stinson, to sum up how friends should behave when a woman is involved in their relationship (for example: ""you dont hit on your friends girlfriend"", ""friends are always more important than a random girl"" and etc). Of course this was made as joke (however some ""moral codes"" there are good to follow), but this is an example of the stuff I mean.

You need to have your own beliefs on things that matters to you. See, for example: when you don't hurt a person, do you have this feeling of ""whether I acted ok now or not""? I guess no, because this is one of your beliefs: that you should not hurt people.

I'm kind of repeating my self, because I'm not sure how to correctly express my self (fyi: I suffer the same problem as you, sometimes I look for confirmation from other people, and keep apologizing about stuff that I think I made wrong).

What I'm trying to say is that you can't just read a book or a how to about moral codes and say ""oh ok, so this is how I should behave"". You need to decide on stuff that is important to you on a less global level than ""dont hurt people"". ""Dont hurt people"" is a very good moral code, and I wish more people would have adopted it, but this is a moral code of a civilized society. Ideally, its applies to the whole society, while what I'm talking about is moral codes for **you** as an individual. If you dont have such, you are just copying other peoples behavior and loose yourself as an individual.

I suggest you to replace the though of ""was it ok that I did X?"" with the though ""Why do I question the act of doing X?"" It will help you to understand yourself better. Try to find the answer to this question. 

* Whether is lack of confidence that makes you question your actions? - Then work on your confidence.
* Maybe you question your action because this action really does not express who you are as an individual? - Then you should probably stop acting like this. Or if you really believe that this is the way you should behave then you need to give this action a time to ""grow"" into your belief. Lets say you decided that you need to be more dominant by speaking louder. It will feel awkward at the beginning, because you just planted a seed in your head ""I want to speak louder"". But this seed still needs to grow and become your belief. While it was not grown yet, you will continue to question your loud talking action: ""am I talking too loud?"" ""what if the other person thinks I was shouting at him?"" and etc. The more confidence you build, the less time it will take this seed to grow and become your adopted belief.

Ask her out. If you don't take the risk, you'll simply be wasting time with someone who's isn't going to reciprocate. That feeling you have while chatting with her till 2am or when you think about her, that's your gut feeling. You have a doubt because you don't know if it's right.

**First and foremost, you need to address the depression.** 

I say this because depression clouds your judgement. You could've went through college getting to experience all the things you missed out on, but still felt like shit at the end of the day because you're depressed. 

You could've gotten invited to the best parties but your depressed mind would be telling you shit like ""So what? Those people don't like you anyways!"" You see what I mean? So you gotta get this under control first so you have a clear picture of your situation, the obstacles (often times they're not as high or daunting as our depressed minds make us feel they are), etc.

If you're open to taking medication: Have you talked to your doctor? Have you tried anti-depressants? Everyone is different but I had good experiences with bupropion personally. Stopped taking it about 3 years ago.  

\- Don't dwell on the past or over what could've been. Acceptance is key to moving forward. You have to accept that you didn't have a typical college experience and then let it go. 

\- It sounds like you need to do some soul searching. What are your hobbies? What do you do for fun? What kind of person do you want to be? Why are you ""not good at friendships""? Etc. 

\- Your financial situation: What is your degree in? What job do you currently have? It also might be worthwhile to try asking career centric subs for advice.

Imagine the kind of person you want to be in a relationship with—maybe she's supportive, confident, has big dreams that she works hard towards—and that's the kind of person you need to strive to be, because that's the kind of person that she wants to be with. It's not impossible to become those things, it just takes work, time, and patience. You have to work on yourself.

A lot of people have given you good advice for working on your anxiety, so I won't address that—I'm going to focus on the ""working on yourself"" part. 

* It's good you have some interests, focus on feeding those, and trying something new. If you have a tight budget you can search for ""free hobbies"" and ""free skills""; I've seen a few popular posts like that. You could volunteer and find meaning in giving back to your community. The goal is to enjoy spending time alone, and to find communities of people with similar interests, if you are a social person.
* Go to the gym a few times a week and build up a routine. Everyone is different but personally I would recommend Stronglifts 5x5, there's a free guide and app if you google it. I have found continuously going to the gym helps my anxiety, and has helped me build confidence in myself. It's also helped me love myself, at a very basic level—sure I don't look like a model, but I know exactly how strong and capable my body is. It's also a good place for me to compete against myself, and to have solid evidence of progress.
* I would STRONGLY encourage you to take a break from dating sites/apps while you take time to focus on yourself. In your current state, you are most likely giving off really strong desperation vibes, and run the risk of attracting someone who is interested in you for the wrong reasons. Give yourself some amount of time—I think 6 months would be a good start—where you aren't allowed to use them, and you focus only on yourself. 
* AFTER you have worked on yourself and you return to these places with confidence and love for yourself, you should think about why and how you are messaging these women. They likely get about a million ""hey how are you"" messages just like yours, and have to try and guess as to who is a genuinely good person they might click with, who is a weird creep, or worse, someone who could hurt them. Make it easier for them. Read their profiles, reach out to people that you are interested in for some reason other than just that they're attractive, and show that in your message. ""Hey, I noticed you like nature—have you been on any good hikes lately?"" Your intent should be to meet someone that you get along with and want to spend more time with, nothing more. If you click, suggest meeting up in public places for casual dates. Be aware that women are often fearful of saying no because they have no way of knowing how you might react—will you swear at them, stalk them? Take rejection in stride, politely, and recognize some ""soft"" forms of rejection (like dodging the question) and leave them alone. 


Finally, you need to deal with this:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm terrified, I'm severely depressed, as I'm writing this I'm crying, I feel like I've failed at life, everyone I know my age has had girlfriends or is with a long term partner.

Romantic love is frankly not the biggest part of life. You've likely already experienced love from friends, family, etc. Focus on what you really want to accomplish with your life—excelling your career? making a difference in the world? treating everyone you meet with care and respect? These are all much, much greater things to do with your life than having a girlfriend. Also, what people your age is doing shouldn't impact your happiness so much. What matters more is the kind of people they are than whether or not they're with someone, and you should hold yourself to that same standard.

If you have a good personality and you’re confident in yourself (not in a narcissistic way) you’ll appear more attractive. Don’t worry about attracting girls but practice self love/self care and be comfortable in your own skin.

The fact that you even thought about paying someone to like you is counterproductive because the people around you seem to be very shallow, so money won’t help you with those people. Sure, you can pay them to like you but they’re just sucking up to you because they’re getting free money but if you do run out of money they’ll disappear in a blink of an eye.

You should pursue your hobbies to get away from those shallow people, and eventually you’ll find someone who will genuinely like you and they won’t ask you for anything (materialistic or to use you) so just wait until the right person comes into your life. 

Of course, it won’t happen right away but it’s hard to find someone who will have a deep relationship with someone, especially in our society where people tend to be more selfish.

I have the same problem, and for me it think it is because i subconsciously want to be underestimated or to just not be perceived as i truly am maybe out of shyness or fear of judgment. silliness is a mask that blocks negativity and harsh comments because you can just use the excuse that ""you were being silly"" on purpose (for the others but more importantly for yourself). i am on a path to try to correct this by practicing my interactions with smaller groups and trying my best to filter out all that would be considered too silly or unfunny. i rate my jokes in my head and think about all the people who would disapprove of this joke before telling it. the percentage of approval and intensity of approval needed are up to you, but i aim for approximately 75% laughs and maximum 5% disapproval or else you could get yourself in an unwanted debate. choose your words carefully when you know you dont share much common values with the people you are with.",1,absolutist,0.4983777,0.4940112,0.007611069,True,evaluativist_as_absolutist,0.4983777

I've had friends like this. Actually, it sounds almost spot on to all my highschool friends. I was the only one who didn't enjoy drinking, preferred to save and spend my money on experiences and travel instead of getting wasted every weekend.

The way they talk to you, is the way they think about themselves if they don't up hold their macho image; ""don't be a pussy"" ""man up"" ""don't be such a bitch"". Think about that... they talk to themselves like shit. The only way they'll feel better is if they're not alone in their own cesspool of degradation.

In my experience, I set up my own personal rules for life. Moral principles and things I wanted in life and if I didn't think it matched my future life, I tried to avoid it. I'm not saying you have to cut them out. You could even be the voice of reason. Tell them why you don't want to do these things. Stand up to them and call them out, even if you're the outcast of that group. You're only seen as the outcast cause it seems you want to make something of your life.

If you stand up for yourself, maybe Larry or Kevin are the scared boys they seem to be and can look up to you, even if it is in silence.

Eventually, one ended up having a breakdown and is alone, one came back and he turned his life around and now I'm standing in his wedding party, one became an alcoholic and didn't get clean for 12 years after highschool, one has no prospects, no savings, no education and chases women from the bars and gets used over and over and over again. The other one... I'm not even sure if he's above ground tbh.

My life... I was depressed. Hopeless being around people who felt like me inside. I was 340lbs and played WoW 16 hours a day. I had enough. I put my education to use, got a job, lost 140lbs, traveled the world, started mentoring around my city and fostered healthier relationships.

A military metaphor for what you are saying is that no plan survives first contact with the enemy.  That's only half the truth, though.  I like the old U.S. Army saying that Dwight Eisenhower made famous:  ""Plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.""  Even though unexpected events will render your plans irrelevant, the thought that goes into creating them prepares you to improvise in an intelligent and informed manner.  

&gt; The request: how can I stop doing this?

You think because your thinking brain doesn't trust your instincts.  It tries to take over, but it isn't quick enough, so you stumble.  To fix this, you need to cultivate confidence in your instincts.  Part of it is just reminding yourself that your instincts have served you well in the past.  Another part is to ensure the right division of labor between your rational brain and your instincts.  Think of your rational brain as a corporate manager.  Right now, it's acting like a micromanager:  it doesn't trust your social intuition to do its job, so it attempts to dictate every detail so your social intuition doesn't have any leeway to screw up.  You can try to tell your rational brain to stop doing that, but it doesn't want to stand back and do nothing.  It needs a job to do, and it has a job to do: like a good manager, it should make sure your social intuition has all the support it needs to work effectively.  Then it can get out of the way and trust your intuition to get the job done.  

The support your rational brain can provide is planning.  Your rational brain can survey the situation, review relevant information, and anticipate different scenarios.  Everything your rational brain thinks about will prime your instincts to respond appropriately.  For example, if you're going to talk to people you know a little bit but not well, you might review basic information about them that will affect your choice of banter:   so-and-so has cancer, so don't compliment her on how much weight she has lost; another person's daughter won a school prize, so you should congratulate them; another person is a Trump supporter but has a great sense of humor about politics, so it's safe to joke with him about it.  Those are things that your instincts could theoretically figure out on the fly, but you can ease the burden a little bit by reviewing them ahead of time.  Then you'll have more confidence, and your rational mind will be a little calmer, because it will know that it has done what it can to ensure your success.

If I were you, I would **shift the frame of reference**. 

Meaning that: instead of caring too much if people care about my birthday, I would care less about what other people think of me and more about what I think about myself.

Things like: Another year has passed for me: 

* How I improved myself? 
* Is my health better or worse than last year? 
* Are my finances better or worse? 
* Are my relationships better or worse?

You see, our minds can focus on very few things at any given moment so if you focus on what matters, you don't have to spend mental energy on things that don't matter (again this is just my opinion but honestly, it couldn't matter less to me if people even know I have a birthday).

The paradox of that is that if you do just that, you will increase your worth in society as a healthier, richer, happier person. **And more people will start being attracted to you**. People that matter, people that want the best for you and will contribute to your well-being for many more happy birthdays :)
